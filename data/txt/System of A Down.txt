Title: Chop Suey!
Release Date: August 13, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-chop-suey-lyrics
Song Description: Rick Rubin, who produced Toxicity for System of a Down, cites this song as one of his most important projects. He told Rolling Stone:

This song was originally going to be called Self-Righteous Suicide, and the record company rebelled. I remember wanting to go to the mat and keep the title, and the band decided, Lets call it Chop Suey! which I thought was kind of funny.

Chop-suey is the Americanization of the Chinese quick dish tsap sui, which means odds and ends, mixed bits in the Cantonese dialect. The song title is a play on Self-right-Chop Suey-cide, that has a further sort of humor in that they mixed up a controversial word into a nonsensical word to create a more radio-friendly title.

The song enjoyed success, climbing the charts after its August 2001 release before virtually disappearing from airwaves after 9/11. The songs chorus, with its congratulatory self-righteous suicide, and lament, I cry when angels deserve to die was considered a bit too raw for listeners at the time. In the wake of the tragedy, Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) put out a memo to its subsidiary radio stations  temporarily blackballing (but not outright banning) it, along with 164 other lyrically questionable songs. Eventually, the record resurfaced on the chartsin part due to its earlier popularity, in part due to the lack of new singles released that September. However, it remains one of System of a Downs worst performing US singles, particularly relative to the songs global performance.

Although the lyrics are viewed as confrontational, the singer is actually challenging the listener to wake up and reconsider the way that they judge and deride people who are engaged in self-destructive behaviors. The song culminates in a biblical connection to Jesus before his death on the cross, with the singer ostensibly having chosen his self-righteous suicide so that these sinners would be forgiven.

Song Description: B.Y.O.B. (Bring Your Own Bombs) is the first single released from American heavy metal band System of a Downs fourth album Mezmerize.

Like their earlier song Boom!, it was written in protest against the Iraq War.

B.Y.O.B. means Bring Your Own Bombs, as opposed to the common interpretation Bring Your Own Booze, referring to the Iraq War as one big party for the United States, where instead of Jgerbombs they drop real ones.

It made onto numerous Top 40 playlists around the globe, including Germany, New Zealand, Australia and the United States, and occasionally made it to #1 on other music shows.

You depend on our protection, yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth

Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, "Freedom!"
Handed to obsoletion; still, you feed us lies from the tablecloth

Title: Aerials
Release Date: September 4, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-aerials-lyrics
Song Description: Aerials was released in June, 2002 as the third single from System of a Downs second album Toxicity, which itself was released in September, 2001.  It was critically and commercially successful; the song was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 2003 Grammy Awards.

Although Daron Malakian said in some shows that Aerials doesnt mean anything, the overall theme of the song is our mistaken views of ourselves as being individual and isolated from the rest and how we actually are a tiny part of something greater, from which we come when we are born, and to which we go when we die. It speaks of clinging to life and not accepting death, because we see death as an ending, not as another step of existence. When we die, our matter is decomposed and is transferred to things like worms that feed on us, to the atmosphere in the form of gas, and to the ground and plants that feed on him. We are always moving through the circle of existence, there is no stillness, only movement, and transformation.

On many CD issues, Aerials is listed as a single track with a length of 6:11. In reality, Aerials itself ends at around 3:54, while the rest of the length is taken up by a hidden track unofficially named Arto.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river and one again after the fall
Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves, but we find it all
'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always wanna go, but you never wanna stay
And we are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play, but you never wanna lose

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river then we turn around and put up our walls
Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves, but we find it all
'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always wanna go, but you never wanna stay
And we are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play, but you never wanna lose, oh

Title: Sugar
Release Date: May 24, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-sugar-lyrics
Song Description: Like many System of a Down songs, Sugar doesnt have a specific meaning. The term sugar is a well-known euphemism for cocaine, which has even worse addictive effects than sugar itself, leading the song to be about the consequences of drug abuse.

Also, Serj Tankian could be comparing the drug obsession with Americas obsession with sugar. In the music video, a pie flashes on the screen w the words Aspartame Kills, a cancerous sweetener.

Some people also claim that the song talks about abuse, violence, media, or the government.

And I just fucking kick her

Title: Lonely Day
Release Date: November 22, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-lonely-day-lyrics
Song Description: Lonely Day is a song by System of a Down, from Hypnotize. Contrary to popular belief, this song is not about Daron Malakians brother, because he is an only child. He wrote this song and provides lead vocals on it. This song has a heavy guitar solo at the end, with a dreary theme throughout.

The song appeared in Disturbia, a 2007 movie starring Shia LeBeouf which was about a kid who stays on house arrest and watches his neighbors to pass the time. The song appeared in a sequence in the movie where Shias character tries to find ways of keeping himself from dying of boredom.
Lyrics:

It's a day that I'll never miss
Such a lonely day and it's mine

Song Description: Hypnotize is the eponymous debut single of System of a Downs fifth album. The song was written after the Tienanmen Square protest, but, in general, it talks about how governments and TV manipulate people, essentially placating them and keeping them focused on propaganda so they can maintain control over the people over whom they rule.
Lyrics:

Title: Prison Song
Release Date: September 4, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-prison-song-lyrics
Song Description: Prison Song is a criticism of the prison-industrial complex, the war on drugs, and the incredibly high rate of incarceration in America compared to other modern nations. The track opens SOADs best-selling album, Toxicity, reflecting the main structure on most of the albums songs: a mixture of melody and screaming. The song is inspired by the time guitarist Daron Malakian was in prison for drug crime.
Lyrics:

Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die

They were crying when their sons left, God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope, he's never coming back
They were crying when their sons left, all young men must go
He's come so far to find the truth, he's never going home

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Young men standing on the top of their own graves
Wondering when Jesus comes, are they gonna be saved?
Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the king his lies

They were crying when their sons left, God is wearing black

Title: Deer Dance
Release Date: September 4, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-deer-dance-lyrics
Song Description: Deer Dance is about police brutality against peaceful protesters who are standing up for what they believe in but to no avail. It also criticizes the tendency of extreme militarization of police, as it makes references to the armor worn by police soldiers, to the military violence and brutality, and even to the heavy warfare weapons.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Circumventing circuses, lamenting in protest
To visible police, presence-sponsored fear
Battalions of riot police with rubber bullet kisses
Baton courtesy, service with a smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Beyond the Staples Center you can see America
With its tired poor avenging disgrace
Peaceful, loving youth against the brutality
Of plastic existence

[Chorus]
Pushing little children with their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children with their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around

[Verse 2]
A rush of words, pleading to disperse
Upon your naked walls, alive
A political call, the fall guy accord
We can't afford to be neutral on a moving train

[Pre-Chorus]
Beyond the Staples Center you can see America
With its tired poor avenging disgrace

And say a little boy smiled, it'll all be well

Song Description: Daron said in an interview that Serj wrote this song and that none of them had any idea whatsoever what it meant, they were just having fun. This is also backed by Serj, who stated on Reddit that the song is about Dadaism, but also said Dont ask in response to a similar question on the same Reddit thread. However, it could still be interpreted any number of different ways.

Title: Spiders
Release Date: February 10, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-spiders-lyrics
Song Description: Spiders is the second single for System of a Downs debut album. It speaks of June, a girl going through a procedure to insert a v-chip in her brain, controlling her thoughts and dreams. It metaphorically speaks of the control imposed on our will by the government, the media and the system.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
The piercing, radiant moon, the storming of poor June
All the life running through her hair
Approaching guiding light, our shallow years in fright
Dreams are made, winding through my head

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Through my head
Before you know, awake

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Your lives are open wide, the V-chip gives them sight
Of all the life running through her hair
The spiders all in tune, the evening of the moon
Dreams are made, winding through my head

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Through my head
Before you know, awake

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Through my head, through my head

Title: Cigaro
Release Date: May 3, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-cigaro-lyrics
Song Description: Cigaro details the pointless and seemingly endless obsession of Boys and their Toys, whether it be the explicit concept of penis size or the size of their guns, men are always trying to prove their superiority over one another.

Serj & Daron criticize the corporate and political bosses that sit back, smoke their cigars, and talk complete shit to further their already grossly inflated egos and public profiles while ignoring laws and restrictions imposed (by them) and promoting their products to the population.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Serj Tankian]

My cock can walk right through the door
With a feeling so pure

Title: Lost in Hollywood
Release Date: May 17, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-lost-in-hollywood-lyrics
Song Description: Lost In Hollywood is a grim illustration of how Hollywood takes normal people looking to fulfill dreams of being an actor, and then viciously changing them into fake people. Fame can do tragic things to people. Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, and Janis Joplin are icons, living legends that died before their time.

So thats how I think of Hollywood. People who dont live here see it as a fantasy land. But I see people giving up their morals, giving up their lives, giving up everything for this town. All the girls who came here to be actresses and ended up as porn stars; all the girls who came here to be models and ended up strippers You talk to six or seven out of ten porn stars and theyd probably rather be doing something else. Strippers, too. [] They can end up on the street selling their asses too. It doesnt have to be in a physical way, either; you can actually feel like you made it and still be selling your ass. I sold my ass before.

Daron Malakian, Guitar World
Lyrics:

You should've never trusted Hollywood

[Verse 2: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]

Title: Bounce
Release Date: September 4, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-bounce-lyrics
Song Description: Bounce is the seventh track on System of a Downs second album Toxicity. Daron said in a concert that the song is about sex, but based on the lyrics, it could be about group sex (often referred as an orgy), the pogo stick Serj talks about is basically a dick.

The song was used in the 2016 childrens film, The Secret Life of Pets.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Serj Tankian]
Jump! Bounce! Down! Up!

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
I went out on a date with a girl, a bit late
She had so many friends (Gliding through many hands)
I brought my pogo stick just to show her a trick
She had so many friends (Gliding through many hands)

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]

Title: Chic ‘N’ Stu
Release Date: November 26, 2002, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-chic-n-stu-lyrics
Song Description: Now this is how you start an album, especially one titled Steal This Album. Its like a jab at modern-day consumerism, especially with a chorus that houses this message:

Need therapy, therapy, advertising causes need

The marketing mantra of create a need is blamed for Serjs obsession with the contents of his fridge. Rather than drag us along for the ride, he lays the situation out and invites us to steal their album to shield us from contributing to this phenomenon.

Chic N Stu is also a shortened way of saying Chicken Stew. Its also paying homage to Chick Hearn and Stu Lantz, sports announcers, the former who coined the term Ball games in the refrigerator.

This song was in the works since at least early 1999, being played live for the first time in April that year at a show in Japan. This early version of Chic N Stu instrumentally remains identical, although Darons additional vocals have not been fully realized by that point. It can be heard here.
Lyrics:

The music has a mixture of rock, metal and reggae. The song never reached any chart, although its one of the bands most-streamed songs.

Title: Needles
Release Date: September 4, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-needles-lyrics
Song Description: Needles is a song that talks about the danger of abusing drugs, more specifically heroin, comparing it to have a parasite in your body; the band advertises everybody, dont do drugspull the tapeworm out of your ass!

The song has also more Daron Malakians vocal appearance, but is a little more melodic, as he said:

I wanted to add a bit more harmony for myself in the songs and that required tastefully mixing in some softer guitars between the really heavy parts.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
I cannot disguise
All the stomach pains and the walking of the canes
When you do come out
And you whisper up to me in your life of tragedy
But I cannot grow
'Til you eat the last of me, oh, when will I be free?
And you, a parasite
Just find another host, just another fool to roast

[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
'Cause you, my tapeworm tells me what to do
You, my tapeworm tells me where to go

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
I cannot deny
All the evil traits and the filling of the crates
When you, you, do come out, out
And you slither up to me in your pimpin' majesty
But I cannot grow
'Til you eat the last of me, oh, when will I be free?

Song Description: Besides environmental aspects, this song could be viewed as a dialogue between God and Jesus. The line make the forest turn to wine certainly alludes to this. When talking about System of a Downs creativity, Rick Rubin used Forests guitar riff as an example. The track, unlike others, doesnt have a great Daron Malakian participation on vocals.

Title: Question!
Release Date: May 17, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-question-lyrics
Song Description: Question! is the second single off of SOADs fourth album Mezmerize. The song rapidly alternates between four different time signatures  9/16 (during the acoustic sections), 6/8 (during the acoustic interludes and the chorus), 5/8 (between these sections), and 4/4 (during the final chorus)  giving a wildly irregular, yet melodic, rhythm.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENBv2i88g6Y

The music video for the song features a boy and a girl portrayed in different stages of their lives, onstage as though in a play. In the end, the girl eats berries and dies and the boy grieves her death, before the cycle of life repeats. The concept for the video was proposed by bassist Shavo Odadjian.

The song could be interpreted as the pondering of the afterlife, or the possibilities of reincarnation. He is wondering if our life completely ends when we physically die, or if our spirit remains.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Sweet berries ready for two, ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you, are you?
Sweet berries ready for two, ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you, are you dreaming?

Title: Suite-Pee
Release Date: June 30, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-suite-pee-lyrics
Song Description: The opening track of System of a Downs first album is, in general, a criticism about pedophile cases in churches and extremely religious people, it isnt criticizing peoples faith. Daron Malakian also talked about that in an interview:

Ill be honest with you: politically, I have no issue with people, but my beef sometimes is with religion at the end of the day and that offends people, I guess, more than telling people what to do. But I just think a lot of people Politicians use religion and they get their troops riled up with religion. And its not just here with Christianity, it's Those dudes, like Bin Laden, these dudes are all politicians themselves they use the simple-minded and the poor and they promise them things and thats how they rile up their troops using religion. And we dont see that as the same as our politicians, but they play the same games with their people over there as the politicians play with the people over here to get them riled up, to go to war Youre fighting for freedom. I just think religion is something It could be a beautiful thing for the individual, but when it becomes organized, thats when religion starts taking a kind of ugly turn to me.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
I had an out of body experience
The other day, her name was Jesus

Everyone cried, everyone cried

Title: Jet Pilot
Release Date: September 4, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-jet-pilot-lyrics
Song Description: Jet Pilot is one of those songs that nobody really knows the meaning behindneither Serj Tankian, maybe. Following the bands Armenian descendency, the song could talk about a, or a series of, Carpet Bombing attacks on Armenia, as

The skies right before
Right before they went grey

But, like many SOAD songs, nobody from the band explained the meaning of it, as their lyrics are open to interpretation. Also, some fans speculate that the song talks about the Shelling of Stepanakert, a bombardment in Armenia.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
My horse is a shackled old man
His, his remorse was that he couldn't survey
The skies right before, right before they went grey
My horse and my remorse flying over a great bay

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
My source is the source of all creation
Her discourse is that we all don't survey
The skies right before, right before they go grey
My source and my remorse flying over a great bay

Title: Protect the Land
Release Date: November 6, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-protect-the-land-lyrics
Song Description: Initially intended for the next Scars On Broadway album, Protect The Land ended up in Systems hands after Daronwho wrote itsent the track to his bandmates in System. To the huge surprise of fans, it was released as a double single along with Genocidal Humanoidz without any prior teasing, marking the Armenian-American bands first release in over 15 years.

The song was written in response to the acts of war and terrorism performed by Azerbaijan with the help of Turkey against the people of Armenia and Artsakh, also known as Nagorno-Karabakh. In an Instagram post, Serj Tankian explained:

The time to do this is now, as together, the four of us have something extremely important to say as a unified voiceThe current corrupt regimes of Aliyev (President of Azerbaijan) in Azerbaijan and Erdogan (President of Turkey) in Turkey not only want to claim Artsakh and Armenia as their own, but are committing genocidal acts with impunity on humanity and wildlife to achieve their mission. They are banking on the world being too distracted with COVID, elections and civil unrest to call out their atrocities.

This conflict has a history dating back to 1988, but large-scale clashes erupted in September 2020, reigniting international attention, as highlighted in the songs accompanying music video.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]

What do we deserve before we end the Earth?
If they will try to push you far away
Would you stay and take a stand?
Would you stay with gun in hand?

Title: Roulette
Release Date: November 26, 2002, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-roulette-lyrics
Song Description: This songs composition is very atypical for a SOAD song; definitely not metal, and hardly rock. Additionally, the lyrics are considerably more literal (less Dadaist) than the rest of their discography.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
I have a problem that I cannot explain
I have no reason why it should have been so plain
Have no questions but I sure have excuse
I lack the reason why I should be so confused

I know how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know how I feel when I'm around you

I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce
Today you saw, you saw me, you explained
Playin' the show when runnin' down the plane

Title: Science
Release Date: September 4, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-science-lyrics
Song Description: This song details the negative effects science has had upon our society. While it is more often than not hailed in a positive omniscient light, Serj believes it has robbed us of the most powerful part of our existence.

Historically religion has been the primary source of education and ideologies, but as we have developed a greater understanding of scientific laws the focus of knowledge has shifted from blind faith to concrete evidence.

Most historic disputes have involved or been centralised around religion, and it has been used historically to appease the masses living in impoverished conditions with promise of reward in the after life if we suffer in this one. We have replaced what has been our most powerful motivator with undeniable, uninterpreted facts.

The main point is that faith and spirit are more powerful than any laws of physics or amount of scientific facts, and that removing this crucial element from our existence will destroy all that we have known and stood for.

Its not about knowing, its about believing.
Lyrics:

[Verse: Serj Tankian]
Making two possibilities a reality
Predicting the future of things we all know
Fighting off the diseased programming
Of centuries, centuries, centuries, centuries

[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Science fails to recognize the single most
Potent element of human existence
Letting the reins go to the unfolding
Is faith, faith, faith, faith

Title: Mr. Jack
Release Date: November 26, 2002, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-mr-jack-lyrics
Song Description: Mr. Jack talks about living within a corrupt police state where those in authority can arrest and condemn whoever they please. System of a Down, in its first demo tape, released the first version of this called P.I.G.

Mr. Jack could be a nickname for the greedy cops who are out to make dirty money for the state rather than actually protect and serve. This explains the freeway line as cops are regularly seen hiding on the side of the road, cheaply trying to pull over any and everyone. Its also a play on the slang term jackboot, which also describes on a holier-than-thou cop who is out for their own good and not the communities.

Title: Sad Statue
Release Date: May 17, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-sad-statue-lyrics
Song Description: Sad Statue talks mainly about the government, but it talks about war and history too. It is a anti-government song, like many other SOAD songs, like B.Y.O.B. or F**k the System, for example.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=705nFEpaxmI

The sad statue in this song is the Statue of Liberty, that is unhappy because people spend all time arguing with each other, and have mostly ignored the fact that the government can be taking away their rights. With no liberty, theres no happiness.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian, Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Conquest to the lover and your love to the fire
Permanence unfolding in the absolute
Forgiveness is the ultimate sacrifice
Eloquence belongs to the conqueror
The pictures of time and space are rearranged
In this little piece of typical tragedy
Justified candy, brandy for the nerves
Eloquence belongs to the conqueror

[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
You and me, we'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue of Liberty
And a generation that didn't agree
You and me, we'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue of Liberty
And a generation that didn't agree

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian, Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
I forgot to, I forgot to let you know that

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Dark is the light, the man you fight with all your prayers, incantations
Runnin' away, a trivial day of judgment and deliverance
To whom was sold this bounty soul, a gentile or a priest?
Who victored over the Seljuks when the holy land was taken?

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Was it the riches of the land, powers of bright darkness
That lead the nobles to the East to fight the heathens

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

[Post-Chorus]
Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
We must call upon our bright darkness
Beliefs, they're the bullets of the wicked
One was written on the sword
For you must enter a room to destroy it, destroy it, destroy it!
No international security, no call of the righteous man
Needs a reason to kill a man, history teaches us so
The reason he must attain must be approved by his God
His child, partisan brother of war

But if you want the answers
You better give a piece of your ass!
Give a piece of your ass

Warning, post-hypnotic suggestions
Runnin' the ships ashore
The orange light that follows
Will soon proclaim itself a god
If you point your questions
The fog will surely chew you up
But if you want the answers
You better get ready for the fire!
Ready for the fire

Title: Fuck the System
Release Date: November 26, 2002, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-fuck-the-system-lyrics
Song Description: If the title of the song wasnt clue enough; this song is just a big fuck you to the system.

A lot of the bands personal work goes toward preventing/spreading awareness of war and genocide. The United States (and other governments) have a big history of starting unnecessary conflicts so in SOADs eyes  they are part of the system they, and many others, try so hard to prevent. The song is all about taking the initiative and calling out the systems weve learned to accept.

Song Description: Innervision is a melodic but aggressive track in which Serj Tankian appears to look inward whilst searching for the answers to life and the universe. The bridge is indicative of a man restless for change, motivated to better himself, and convinced of his path, whether that be through religion or gaining an ironclad sense of self.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Well, I have a home, longing to roam
I have to find you, I have to meet you
Signs of your face, slowing your pace
I need your guidance, I need to seek my innervision

[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]

Song Description: The song is considerably less thrash metal oriented than most of the other songs on the record, with the chorus being heavier, and the verses having a more polka oriented sound. The songs lyrics can be viewed as being about drug use or arguing against it.

Title: A.D.D. (American Dream Denial)
Release Date: November 26, 2002, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-add-american-dream-denial-lyrics
Song Description: A.D.D is also a disorder known as Attention Deficit Disorder. The disorder can cause absent-mindedness, difficulty focusing, forgetfulness, or the combination of all three (plus other symptoms). The American Dream Denial may be a play on this  as the implication of the song seems to be that Americans are completely oblivious to the fact that the American Dream no longer exists. Were constantly distracted by whats being fed to us on television, and what not, that we cannot see what is really happening within our own country. Those in power manipulate our attention and keep us where they want us.



It should be noted, however, that A.D.D. is no longer the proper terminology. It is A.D.H.D., and the disorder has two primary presentations and is spectrum-like by nature. Because of this, its possible to have all or most of the symptoms of each presentation of A.D.H.D., which is classified as the combined presentation.
Lyrics:

You sent us back in body parts

Title: Bubbles
Release Date: November 26, 2002, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-bubbles-lyrics
Song Description: Bubbles uses a prolonged metaphor of life as a bubble jungle, which could mean a plethora of things, but the pairing of fish would suggest that its describing the ocean. The idea of a jungle also shows that it may be hard to escape. This bubble jungle describes the cities and towns we live in where we represent the fish. We continue on in this environment, unaware of the dangers, but not determined to take the initiative and break the mold. Instead of carrying onlike mindless fish.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Fish that don't drown, life in a bubble jungle
I wouldn't frown, not short another chuckle
Snake in the ground, but I was in there for you
Now, leaving town, life in a bubble jungle

[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
Seeing you believing, us adhering, we're the power struck
Believing, then kneeling, appeasing, the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Wearing the crown, life in a bubble jungle
Chasing a clown, not short another chuckle
Snake in the ground, but I was waiting for you
Now, we have found, life in a bubble jungle

[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
Seeing you believing, us adhering, we're the power struck
Believing, then kneeling, appeasing, the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle

[Post-Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Left with no arms in the power struggle
Left with no arms in the power struggle

I'm alone, sitting with my broken glass
My four walls follow me through my past
I was on a Paris train
I emerged in London rain
And you were waiting there
Swimming through apologies

[Chorus 1]
I remember searching for the perfect words
I was hoping you might change your mind
I remember a soldier standing next to me
Riding on the Metro

[Verse 2]
I was smiling as you took my hand
Saw the moon, we spoke in France
You were passed the shallow words
Years have passed and still the hurt
You were passed the shallow words
Years have passed and still the hurt
I can see it now, smiling as I pulled away
Sorry

[Chorus 2]
I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand
"I love you" always filled my eyes

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Stretching, filing, against her skin
Blessed are those who are not kin
In sin, we breathe; in sex, we tie
Duct tape her legs to the red sky
Foolsome flesh allowances
The pansies raided the pantry of
Gabardine dreams, promiscuous
Delight, deny not the flavor

[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Custard dreams
Abusing, musing
Marmalade flesh
Naked spread am I, am I

Actors of the tragic phantom
Extend your legs for great Saturn
Brown table tops scream for cover
At the sight of your new lover

And can't deny
The poison chosen
For tonight, tonight

Song Description: Friik is a demo that originally appeared on System of a Downs fourth demo tape.

What’s my problem, here’s my problem
My problem is that I’m too visual to be blind
Too audiological to be deaf, too ideological to be in peace
Too compassionate to be in war, too crazy to be sane
Too sane to be lazy, too emotional to be you

If I could only stop my head
From going into constant infection
Then maybe I could swim back
To my own version of consistent sanity
Angelic demons, liquid dreams
Transparent mountains of our own reality

Melting faces, why?

Want a war, you niggas better bring yo' force (come on)

Guess who I'm going wit, my own niggas
See, I pay my own trip
Make my own chips, I copped my own six, I knock my own shit
Like I'm on my own dick
My day be short, need coke, raid the fort
I'm knocked by the cops, come blaze the court
And though niggas die for, go on the shelf
Disrespect and spend like a man below your belt
Me, I always had, so I never go for self
Had thousand dollar bills with Teddy Roosevelt
Better slow down, tellin' you now, put the dough down, kick your door down
Surround the block, where you go now?
Fifty shots spit at you and that is not a whole round

Bitches ain't around when it's time to go to war
This shit here, nothing to fuck with
I'm the same bitch
All y'all wanna try y'all luck with
Lil' Kim spread like syphilis
You think I'm pussy? I dare you to stick your dick in this
Chrome .44, inconspicuous in the 6-0-0, shit's ridiculous
Speak when you're spoken to and only with permission
Like EF Hutton, when I talk, niggas listen
So don't y'all be mad at me
'Cause I'm the Q to the B to the motherfuckin' EE
Copped my CD, now all y'all wanna be me
See me on the TV, beds will dip in 3D
Peep the CD, chromed out and phoned out
My shit is paid for, your shit is loaned out
I gets it on
Money keep growin', ice fully glowin', plus I'm bad to the bone
In the danger zone, I hold my own when the pain is gone
Like a splinter I enter
So why should I throw my blows in those?
Do a bit upstate and take the weight for your troubles
My nigga BIG, Imma ride for
But it ain't too many niggas that I'd die for

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
What you get and what you see
Things that don't come easily
Feeling happy in my vein
Icicles within my brain, cocaine

Winter's ice, it soon will spread
Death would freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold, cocaine

Turns my day to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come, cocaine!

Here, now, forever
Happiness ends at the end of a beautiful tunnel
Now, forever

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Run, run, run away, to a land far away
Where the hills are green and the water is gray
Maria ran with passion, not seen in women
Thanks for the bigger life and it's forceful
Daddy, no longer the man, no matter
Due is her freedom for loneliness with the dollar
No longer the man, no matter

[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
I've been poisoned by God
The devil is money
I will never marry, 'til I'm ready
To be a perfect man

Title: Flake
Release Date: 1995, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-flake-lyrics
Song Description: Toast is the third song on System of a Downs untitled demo tape. The drummer for the first four demo tapes, Ontronik Andy Khachaturian, said that this song was originally called Flake in the comments of a YouTube mirror of this song. Aside from that, not much else is known about this song.

Due to the low audio quality and Serjs distorted mic, the lyrics are nearly unintelligible.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
—grace
Living in my room, and looking out through my door
Is there a reason to be or else think like me?
And hear the people around were not known to be bound
Being embraced out of President's grace, then they come and batter you

[Pre-Chorus]
All around me, people, well are they killed?
Hold me 'round the throat, well are they killed?
All around me, people, are they killed?
Killed? Killed? Killed? Killed?

[Chorus]
You flake! You flake! You're gonna fuckin' flake!
You flake! You flake! You're gonna fuckin' flake!
You flake! You flake! You're gonna fuckin' flake!
You flake!

[Verse 2]
The ghost with a heart of darkness
Pierces the hardened soul
Kneel to the killing by me
Bow down to the governor of all
Listening to freedom, do another disgrace
When they hear that the president beats me
Listening to freedom, do another disgrace
When I hear that the [?] beats me

When your earth is dieing, your sky, your earth, your water and forests
Genetic world is picking over mutations of man

For a much better game, a much more profitable mortgage

Unless you open your eyes to what in the world is happening

Traveling hearts divine the throne, I've forgotten too

Want me to try

Song Description: This is an unreleased song of SOAD. Its the early version of Thetawaves.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
The unsettled mind is at times an ally
Leaving the senses to fend for themselves
The senses collect from the valuable data
Of beta carotene and thetawaves
The unsettled mind is at times an ally
Leaving the senses to fend for themselves
Then the senses wander the sky

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Is there life in longing for you?
Is there life in waiting for you?
Waiting for you

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
The national debt is at times an ally
Leaving the people to fend for themselves
The people collect of the undeniable data
Of eyeballs, weapons and microwaves
The national debt is at times an ally
Leaving the people to fend for themselves
Then the people found out the lie

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Is there life in longing for you?
Is there life in waiting for you?
Waiting for you
Waiting for you

[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Waiting to get you high
Waiting to touch the sky

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Is there life in longing for you?
Is there life in waiting for you?
Is there life in longing for you?
Is there life in waiting for you?
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Waiting for you

Title: Everytime
Release Date: 2002, URL: https://genius.com/System-of-a-down-everytime-lyrics
Song Description: This song is the version before Boom!.
This was the title before it was leaked online.
SOAD changed the title to differentiate the filtered edition and the official edition.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
I've been walking through your streets
Where all your money's earning
Where all your buildings crying and clueless neckties working
Revolving fake lawn houses, housing all your fears
Desensitized by TV
Overbearing advertising, God of consumers
And all your crooked pictures looking good, mirrors
Filtering information through the public eye
Designed for profit sharing, your neighbor, what a guy

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Modern globalization, coupled with condemnations
Unnecessary death, matador corporations
Puppeting your frustrations with a blinded flag
Manufacturing consent is the name of the game
The bottom line is money, nobody gives a fuck
4000 hungry children leave us per hour from starvation
While billions are spent on bombs, creating death showers

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Why must we kill our own kind?

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bombEmbed

The Kombucha mushroom people sitting around all day
Who can believe you? Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray

Sugar, New York City!

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
I'm not there all the time, you know
Some people, some people, some people call it insane
Yeah, they call it insane (Sugar)
I play Russian Roulette everyday, a man's sport
With the bullet called life
Yeah, mama, called life (Sugar)
Yeah, and every time I try to go where I really want to be
It's already where I am
'Cause I'm already there! (Woo-hoo!)

Let your mother pray

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
I got a gun the other day from Sako
It's cute, it's small, fits right in my pocket
Yeah, right in my pocket (Sugar; Sako!)
My girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes
And I just fucking kick her
And then, ooh baby, she's okay (Sugar)
People are always chasing me down
Trying to push my face to the ground
Where all they do is suck out my motherfucking brains
My brains (Woo-hoo!)

No lights, no music
Just anger, I've killed everyone
I'm away forever, but I'm feeling better
How do I feel? What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
In the end, it all goes away

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
We fought your wars with all our hearts
You sent us back in body parts
You took our wills with the truth you stole
We offer prayers for your long lost soul

[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
The remainder is
An unjustifiable, egotistical, power struggle
At the expense of the American Dream
Of the American dream, of the American, of the American

[Chorus: Serj Tankians]
We don't give a damn about your world
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls
We don't give a damn about your world
Right now, right now
We don't give a fuck about your world
With all your global profits, and all your jeweled pearls
We don't give a fuck about your world
Right now, right now
Right now, right now

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
There is no flag that is large enough
To hide the shame of a man in cuffs
You switched the signs then you closed our blinds
You changed the channel then you changed our minds

We bring about the confusion
Bring about the solution

Bring about the collusion
Bring about revolution

With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls
We don't give a damn about your world

We don't give a fuck about your world

No flag large enough
Shame on a man in cuffs
You closed our blinds
