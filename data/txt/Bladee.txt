Lyrics:

[Intro: Bladee]
Can't you see it?
Bad dog, but for you I'm obedient
Trash Star, cross my heart, that's the reason
Look up at the stars, they're retreating
Don't get lost, don't live what I'm preaching
Drain Jesus, ice me immediately
Can't even come home when it's freezing
925, burn me my medallion

[Verse 1: Bladee]
Smell like spray paint, yeah, what I'm off of
Link at the gas stop, won't stop, I can't stop
Can't even see clear where I'm at though
This not a mansion, it's a castle
You a fuckboy, heard it from Ecco
Drain Show, no face, came through the back door
We can't even bring no girls in my section
Feel like OD9, I'm a dragon
Can't even talk to myself 'cause I'm wrong now
White gate calling me, won't be long now
I can't even put those words in my songs now
Big strong compounds, life force get crossed out
Siren calling, ambulance sound
Drain Gang track you down like a Bloodhound
I can't even trust myself when the night comes
Four doors, red or blue, pick the right one
It's some writing on the wall, it said "Die scum"
No heart, but I do wish I had one
And my baby wanna know what I'm scared of
Don't worry, it's been taken care of
Bladee, I'm coming for the trash like a trashman
Hell Gang, put that back in the trash can
I can't even trust myself when the night comes
Step on my head twice like a cockroach

Every time I close my eyes, I stop existing
Every now and again, I can tell the difference
Woke up falling, I'm still falling off of buildings
Want a new addiction, want to fall victim
Something you might crush my heart but I'ma risk it
And I'm still sinking, need a curse lifted
Blacklisted at all the clubs, but I can fix this
Think I need stitches, pray to three sixes
I wanna see heads roll, execute past life
Hundred white birds, ninety-nine fall out the sky
Fast life, race against time, it will outrun you
Rains return to the earth, sunlight to the underworld
Maybe in another life we could be lovers
Ever since we met, these thoughts keep getting worse
Iron will, ironed shirt, now I want a Fendi purse
I don't talk with empty words, what is any of it worth?
Every time I close my eyes, I go to prison
Every now and again, I can feel the distance
Woke up running, I'm still running through the system
Want a new sickness, want to fall victim
Somewhere, someone broke your heart but I'ma fix it
And I'm still wishing for that first kiss
Get blacklisted at all the clubs in Seven Sisters
Industry children play with three sixes

Take a bunch of empty words and make them mean something
I've been getting no gifts for a while, is Christmas coming?
I'm a good boy on the track, no cussing
Please do not give me any more flak, I am struggling
I'm about to start crying in my bed, Evil Words spin around my head (Ha)
I'm going Trash Star crazy (Ha)
I'm Bladee, she call me Blade-e (Ha)
Angel or demon maybe (Ha)
I'm trying do what I can (Ha)
Can you please comprehend me?
Why can't you understand?
I'll shine some glory on your life (I don't know)
I am not anyone, I'm just some air inside the air

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Put a pill in a McFlurry, I'm goofy
Shoot me, acting for the cameras, it's a movie
I can see you're gloomy, 'cause I'm too T'd
I'm a dog on the roof like Snoopy
Sue me, hate me 'cause you're not me
I'm a white boy, 30 in my khakis
In the Uber and I sleep, fuck a car key
Love the smell of gasoline, bleach and sharpies
I was on Miami beach on a dark street
I wake up with sweaty sheets, sometimes it's deep
I'ma smoke a pound of weed if I can't sleep
If you can't sleep, you should call me
I'm in Stockholm for a week, I move discreet
Acting crazy off the coke, you can get beat
I make money off of songs, so it came free
So it goes free, put it on me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fight, nothing to talk about, walk it out
If you mad, don't wanna talk it out with you, Mickey Mouse
I'm inside the mansion, can't get out, get your feelings out
Gatekeeper, lock you out, Rainworld, we lock it down
MIA, I'm missing, can't be found, that's without a doubt
Do it for the money like a clown, watch me falling down
Swimming in the deep end, you might drown, I'ma bleed the crown
I can't feel the ground when I walk around
See Bladee LiveGet tickets as low as $23You might also like[Verse 2]
I'ma take a moment for my mind, we used to be tight
I go even deeper in the night, I'ma read my rights
I don't wanna open what you write, in another life
I get in my feelings like a knife, my heart bleeding out
I have tears inside and I don't even know how to cry
But it's giving me a drive, I just go on with my life
Tell me why you do me like you do, you don't need to lie
I'ma paint a smile, it's a disguise, I finesse you twice

[Bridge]
High-five me, three-strike me, you like me? That's funny
I'm worried 'bout money, not about you, you're ugly
You're old news, that's dusty, I'm edgy, don't push me
I hang with some junkies, I'm shady, don't trust me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fight, nothing to talk about, walk it out
If you mad, don't wanna talk it out with you, Mickey Mouse
I'm inside the mansion, can't get out, get your feelings out
Gatekeeper, lock you out, Rainworld, we lock it down
MIA, I'm missing, can't be found, that's without a doubt

Heaven say, "I'm on my way"
I don't care what Heaven say, I'm waiting for your embrace

The track was first performed on Yung Leans Warlord Tour.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Who goes there? It's the ghost of October
Summer's over, now I'm goin' nowhere
Who holds her? It's not me, I'm a loner
But I don't wanna go-go-go there
You're sober, that's not me, I'm a stoner
I prefer it when the world moves slower
Who goes there? It's just me and my soldiers
I come from the snow, it's cold-cold-colder

[Verse]
It's bad, it's bad
You don't know what I am, I'm a sick man
And this world feels so distant
But today I'm feelin' so indifferent
Every Friday's Halloween
My week is a dream, I'm just walkin' in my sleep
By any means, I'll be lowkey
I'm gonna need a reason to be seen
All the prayer is for nothing
No touching, I find it disgusting
Flyin' in my lane with my cousin
Why they bugging? I don't do discussion
I'm on an airplane to London
They want something from me all of a sudden
I'll come up when I'm summoned
I heard everything was gonna change but it worsened

[Intro]
Someone free me from my skin
Evaporated, now I'm gone in the wind
Something ended, but nothing new did begin
I carry weight until my spine's giving in

[Verse 1]
My words, they didn't mean a thing
I was just trying to get in
You're looking for someone, but I'm not him
What do you want from me? I'm just wondering
Hating on the kid, but I don't want to live
I don't have anything to give to you
I stay with the crew
And we don't need anything from you

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been to Hell and back for twenty stacks
I keep on going 'til my visions black
I'm lost and I'm not going back
And I got a pack, leave me, I don't wanna match
It's funny how they wanna act
X-Ray Gucci shades so I can see through that
Cut you in your throat and make you free at last

Drugs tryna stop it but can't beat that feeling
Trying to go out, how you feeling?
When you're with us, you know it's easy
I know it's hard to even see me
But when you do you get lucky for a year
I tried to tell them about the night, they didn't understand
I tried to show 'em that there's beauty and there's magic in the air
They didn't understand, there's shadow in the light
Open up your mind, there is no day without the night
Bladee, I'm dancing with the stars and I'm pulling joker cards
And I'm going to the sky, I'm going, going, gone
Sacrifice your ego, let go, on my way to the throne, I know
Never be solo, I got my soul, riding around single
Eons at a time take your time, endlessly forever shine
In my heart, in my arms, be forever, baby
Eons at a time never die, never die forever

Cold outside and I don't know what to wear

I can't look back, and I cannot lose control
Find yourself, find yourself

Title: Reality Surf
Release Date: July 16, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-reality-surf-lyrics
Song Description: In reality surf, Bladee talks about the differing mental attitudes him and and someone he cherishes posses. Bladee worries they think too negatively and wants them to think more like he does and be positive. Reality surf (to me) feels like the closest continuation of Exeter he has produced. This could be down to the influence of Gud. The story he tells is almost like the second chapter of Lovestory. Every path leads back to you again ,from Lovestory, and Everything related back to you, on Reality surf, highlights the similarities in themes between the two songs. Where as, in Reality surf Bladee deals with both the positives of their relationship as well as his struggles with the persons mental attitude. Lovestory is a much more one sided affair that explains the elation Bladee feels as a result of their relationship when he states on Reality surf Tree so ripe, we got fruit and Reality surf therefore is put into a proper context for the listener and a story begins to unfold as a result.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
(Tree so ripe) Tree so ripe, we got fruit
We got crowns, salute it, yeah, it's real
Put a concept on that feeling
Take a word and change the meaning
Only you

Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Venom in the vile
Enemies closer than you
Trick them into buying
Snakes slither in the spine, take the fruit
Still a dirty city throwing cards (Yeah, yeah)
Everything related back to you (Back to you)
I have never been the one to talk
Cinderella, Cinderella, wear it if it suits
Build it just to watch it fall apart
Looking for the arrow when you shoot
You take yourself seriously, just stop
Listen to your heart
Mirror, mirror, the reflection of the law
I just wanna show you something new (New)

Maybe you can show me what it takes to end forever
Emptiness, it came again
When it's from inside you know you can't defend against it
Writing, but I can't press send (No)
Kisses from the raindrops tell me "Wait again, one last time"

[Chorus]
Clean, clean, clean, cut the rope, let me in
Wings, wings, wings, I grow wings, I go in
Scars, scars, scars, I got scars on my arms

For me, you don't have to do anything
When I'm in your area, the flowers start withering

Flash—, flash—, flash from a clear sky, let the fear fly
House party nearby, I'm bringing weird guys
I need some wet wipes and some Clear eyes
Stop signs and red lights, outside Best Buy
Hit with the Maglite in my head twice
Hit the plug for the drugs, ain't tryna live a long life
I was born with the bad luck, I don't ask why
You don't want to see me out, that's a bad sign5Embed

Lyrics:

[Chorus: Bladee]
The first born got his world torn
I came out of the ice storm
This blood sword is my light source
At the white shores when the night falls
Was my life form worth to cry for?
Off like ten pills, now I'm stillborn
Gotta stay pure just to make sure
Gotta watch out who you fall for

[Verse 1: Bladee]
Smelling like an orchid, I got sources, it's imported
It's another morning, there's no ending to my story
Got the blood veil, I just almost met the reaper
In the shadows and I breathe them
In the ghost house with my people, it's the Shield Gang
I got all these shields and you can't breach them
On a plane, I'm switching seasons
Wait for God to give a reason to me
Daytime creeping, I can't fuck with human beings
I'm not sure what to believe in, I catch commas, not no feelings
You know Drain Gang, I got vampires in my city
Hit the party, take 'em with me, hit me up when I'm not busy
Feel like Casper, feel like you can't see me when I'm friendly
You can see me wearing Fendi as soon as I made my entry

[Verse 2: Ecco2k]
Off some pink flats, trying to get my feelings back
Breathing in the ash, X should mark the hidden past
A thousand bits of glass on me, I got glitter hands
Turning into sand, vacuum seal like plastic bags
Sleeping with a chain on me, feel like 50 Shades
Issey Miyake, CDG my aftershave
It feels like acid rain, every day I feel the same
Maybe in a way I will never feel again
I gotta disconnect when they get too intimate
Black Afghan, breaking open cigarettes
I'm so innocent, but I got some evil friends
I just wanna spend, never fall in love again5Embed

Lyrics:

[Intro]
I tried, you know? I tried playin' life, man

[Verse]
Fucked up for days, can I catch a break?
Just wanna go away, make it go away
Just running through the days, running through the pain
Bring my life to waste, was it all a waste?
Was it all a waste? Was it all a waste?
I'm smokin' so much dope, can I take a break?
I know you know I know I made a mistake
I'm just trying to touch the real but it's plastic, fake
Plastic face, tragic on the way
Only way I make it through the day is, I can't say
I can't say, sorry, I can't say
Sorry, mom, I know you hate to see me this way
Fall in love and jump
Are you drunk? I was actin' dumb
Pills under my tongue, I feel numb
Don't like anyone
Empty, fill my cup
I fucked up, cut me up my cut
Catch you out, you're slumped, he's a bum

Title: I Think...
Release Date: May 28, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-i-think-lyrics
Song Description: Bladee talks about the different levels in which we can find ourselves within a metaphorical scale in life and how little importance being higer or lower has because you will never be able to be there forever. This can be clearly understood when he says:


'At the end, it wasnt worth much, not a thing
The duality of life, uh-huh, thats it.'



You have to be willing to be down bad and wrong and learn from it, you also have to be willing to have fun and say: why not?


'Say you wanna have some fun, fuck it, Im in
Might as well live in a cage you take my wings.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Dark outside (Yeah)
Uh-huh (Whatever)
Dark inside

[Chorus]
This is what I really want, it is, I think (Mmm)
You think it mattered so much to me but it didn't (Nah)
One day I am here, the next I'm gone, extinct (Extinct)
I've become so very small, I shrink, it is

[Bridge]
Pure love only, baby
Always is, always was
Make and break me, baby
Is this all, is this all I want

[Chorus]
Maybe I could be the one for you, I wish
I wish I could play the sport, I hit, I miss
But im coming back, of course you do, know this
I come out of the abyss but then I sink

[Verse]
Sink into the, into, into
Dark i fade, like love I fade away
One day I'm here, thе next I'm gone
I'm gone, away, that's tough
Pray, I pray for somеthing
I pray all night every day, I pray (Please God)
Was it all for nothing, nothing's all

Every night I get that cold vision
It's like when you think your phone's missing
It's like falling but there's no limit
It's like a head with a hole in it
In the sewer there's some gold in it
They counted me out for no reason
What's the reason then? Show me
We got high during the prohibition
Me and Whitearmor going high speed
I'm in Miami doing Tai Chi
I'm in a forest with a high priest
I'm in Off-White Nike like a hypebeast
Weed hitting me like a nice breeze
My whole lifе is like a livestream
Put that drama shit bеsides me
Put Yung Lean inside a iced tea
Put a window on my life, so much that I look out of it
Keep your pedestal and price, I wanna get in a fight
I can't work out what's your vibe but I do feel I'm above it
To be honest I don't love it, running to it, running from it

Song Description: In Noblest Strive, Bladee faces his insecurities and reflects on his mistakes, singing about positive energy and making his mind a safe haven for himself. His vocal cadence and flow on this track is quite heavenly, perfectly blending in with the surreal, climactic whitearmor instrumental.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Turn your mental prison into a maze
Turn the maze into a place where you're safe
Right now stepping on the graves even
Everything will wither and decay
But the energy will stay
Every day, early, late, every second even
Turn away for nothing, just in case
A sensation but it's strange
In a way everything is a secret even
Call myself a vessel, not a name
Call a taxi in the rain
Take a plane out of space to confess, I need it

[Chorus]
Endlessly reflecting in your gaze
Drop the mirror and it breaks
Seven years, seven tears, seven different heavens
Blue and black, I chase another shade
And I'm transcending the grey
To the rainbow in my brain, this array of color
Endlessly go over my mistakes
Just to find out what it takes
To be great, separate, differentiating
You hold on to me, the part that stays
Makes me grounded in a way, fly away
But today I'll go up, I know it

Pray my card will be a ace

(But I can't forever)

[Chorus]
Endlessly reflecting in your gaze
Drop the mirror and it breaks
Seven years, seven tears, seven different heavens
Blue and black, I chase another shade
And I'm transcending the grey
To the rainbow in my brain, this array of color

Title: Apple
Release Date: April 4, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-apple-lyrics
Song Description: Apple is a single by Swedish artist Bladee. The track was produced by Whitearmor and was first previewed at Electric Brixton in London in March 2019. The song is a reflection on Bladees career and his philosophies.

It tells the story of his astral form (Ishtar?)s journey through the mortal realm of darkness and arrival at final enlightenment / liberation. Strap in, here we go:

Be a part of me // Make it be a part of me
- bladee has found/forgiven/vanquished the demon(s)/problems/attachment to his ex within himself, gained power of the dark half that has been haunting him since ~2012, gained the power of the demon(s), and made it be a part of him.

What can I say? // Everything just happened to play out this way
- There are no words/sounds/verses to describe the enlightenment and the completion of the great work. its taken a long long time, but happened to play out this way (i.e. long winding journey thru darkness) because it had to in order for bladee/us/earth to learn the lessons it needs to learn in order to heal.

I remember when I was in Miami, off the Xans // I paid three hundred for fakes
- When bladee was first gaining personal/spiritual power and becoming his true self  beginning this journey  he went to Miami with Lean, hedonistically channelled his earthly power (money) into/on the evil reptile spirit drug unholy trinity (benzos/meth/opiates; they are literal demons), went too far to the dark side with his newly found power because it he still had karma to burn. burnt this karma in a big way by killing Barron while fucked up, acknowledges thats the most evil act hes committed in this life and feels genuinely sorry for it in every day and on every song

F-f-fake prada on my face // Now I got real prada on my face // This shit is crazy
Even with all of his money and fame and power in Miami, he was aligned with the wrong forces and even bought fake prada, a mistake the true drain angel would never make. This wasnt a mistake he/her/his holy guardian angel made  it was his biggest personal demon/serpent/insecurity whispering in his left ear. Now hes healed and adorned in sparkling gems; the physical form matches the astral form; as above so below; the great work is completed

New day, new pain // Nothing was ever the same
Double meaning  every day in his struggle through the darkness was technically a new day on earth but brought him no light or joy, just new pain, as for many souls over the past ~7 years. But since being saved and seeing the light nothing has ever been the same, in the outside world/within bladee/within his perception and power

Im three three three for the Ain // The numbers fell from the rain
The incredibly powerful demon which was binding bladee and killed Barron is named Chronozon, lord of dispersion and hallucinations, the female half of the beast, the imperfect twin, the blind raging god. Chronozons sigil/number/sign  and the book of Aliester Crowleys in(famous) Book of Lies is 333. Chronozon can be permanently bound in its prison, but only by the male solar energy (divine will) of its intelligent, usually male host. The magii have known this for centuries; the symbolism is all around us. Bladee has found this teaching somehow, bound his most ancient archnemesis on the ethereal plane back into its prison of darkness, and implies this process happened in/with the help of the rain. Water is a classic ancient healing symbol of the feminine, the moonlight, the downward flowing female energy, the unborn psychic female child that forms in the womb and lives inside all of our higher selves. Restoring innocence to, forgiving, and freeing this young innocent female energy is essential to uniting the upward flowing male solar current and spinning the chakras/7 churches of old testament/7 menorah candles in the astral spine.

New year, new me // It used to be two, now its three
Humankind was saved (i.e. the total amount of psychic love/light has somehow outweighed the total amount of psychic hatred/blindness/darkness) in late December 2019 and is preparing to leave Earth for good very soon. See: Ricky Gervaiss speech. The second part of this line refers to the holy child/golden child, born of the union between the dark and light halves within earth/man. Weve had God (the sun, energy, this planet), Jesus (divine female forgiveness and empathy that lives in all)  all thats left to us is to marry them within the world and ourselves. Immaculate conception; creating life from nothing; Watchmens Thermodynmic Miracle. What was was once two is now one. We are ready to ascend as a species.

The apple fell far from the tree // I hear someone calling to me
Nod to Eris / Discordianism, the modern physical manifestation of the divine female and playful chaos energy. Second part, bladee has either unlocked psychic powers, feeling psychotic, or hears the siren song of Eris pulling him into the next dimension. Rest of the song follows in the same vein but is more terrestrial (and hard af).. Ill stop here this is too much. Thanks for reading; see you soon

Title: Trash Star
Release Date: February 1, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-trash-star-lyrics
Song Description: Trash Star is bladees reference to his persona and career as bladee and is a self-deprecating critique. In the track bladee is describing his lifestyle as a self-proclaimed trash star.  In an interview bladee describes:

Being an artist and people worshiping you  thats being a trash star (since it involves vanity and false ideology). Furthermore he adds . I dont want to be worshipped or looked up to, I just want people to be inspired and find their own calling through my music and through what I do. This shows us that bladee sees himself as a kind of false idol.

The phrase links to his Trash island concept that describes the shallow materialistic world referencing drugs and money that he describes in his lyrics is all just irrelevant.  Bladee describes:

This material world and material things  its all trash. The only true worth is whats inside you, man. The rest of the shit is all just trash. The world is a trash island.

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse]
Out the gate like Messiah (Like Messiah)
Crown around my head in barbed wire
They tried to exile with no trial
I'ma put my feet up on the fire (On the fire)
It’s so wet, I put it on the dryer (Dryer)
Hit her with the "you can't come, it's private"
I can’t eat, I had to go on a diet (Diet)
Can't you tell I keep it on a budget? (On a budget)
Beating myself up, I'm with the violence
In a tunnel, vision, I see no way out
And it's Disney Channel in the playhouse (Playhouse)
I'll wake you up at the ending
It's true, you can never be this high (High)
There's no winner or losers in this fight
Everything you think of all time
I don't want your body, touch your mind (Touch your mind)
They want to know how I am so trendy
33, they say I got too many
Be like me, let me know when you ready (When you ready)
Metal round my wrist, it’s weighing heavy

[Refrain]
Wanna be the hero of my story
Baby, if you let me be annoying (If you let me be)
Wanna wake up early in the morning
I just never wanted to be boring (It will never be)
Wanna be like me you can’t afford it
Rainworld you will always be a tourist (You'll never be)
Never be like me, to be honest
They like how I’m steppin' with the Prada's (You can't walk like me)

Title: Special Place
Release Date: December 29, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-special-place-lyrics
Song Description: Special Place, produced by Lusi and Rip is a song that is often interpreted as Bladee detailing things he enjoys as a sexual release. The other side of the coin however might be a very sarcastic and bitter track in which Bladee is speaking to the entertainment industry as a whole. An industry in which he feels he is displayed, rated, and made to be whatever people want him to be.
Lyrics:

I'm taking off my face
No start, just grey, I'm in my special place
I'm in my special place

[Chorus]
Public display me, shame me, baby
I do it all for you, rate me
Lie and betray me, hate me, you play me
I'll be whatever you make me

[Verse 2]
Always crying 'bout yourself, make me wet
I can be your pet, play dead
Can step on my neck, walk over my head
My eyes are red, Drain Gang, we triple threat
I stay in the night, I should go to bed (Drain Gang)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Bladee]
All this old money really make me feel old
Mark the tracks when I go, remember me when I go
What's the facts when you talk, and you don’t know?
Make it red in the snow, in the trees like a crow
With my brats buying clothes, we gross
Black bag with the trash pack, weighin' like a stone
I tell Thaiboy send the cash to me through the post
And then Nino sent the stack to me through the post
I've been staying in my head trippin’, nobody knows
I've been moving ten feet back when you're coming close
I've been staying in the Red Light, red like a rose
All this time I got your hopes up, you've been talkin' to a ghost
Forever is a long time, I wasn't even close
Hide my wounds like I'm a pro, now it won’t even show
You’ve been saving up for months, I'ma blow it on clothes
Keep guessing about my next move, you’re not even close
I wasn't even close

[Chorus: Bladee]
I don't wanna get in your way, but you get in my way
'Cause you’re everything when I'm seeing you
I don't wanna ruin your day, I just wanna know you're okay
Guess I'm more than okay when I be with you
I don't wanna tell me your name 'cause it fucks with my brain
Even when I sleep, dreams, I'll be seein' you
I don't wanna tell you nothing 'cause you know everything
And you see everything when it's me and you

Cut you off, I'm beheading you
You're dead, man, so I'm deading you
You're just here 'cause I'm letting you

Coming back like a carousel

I'm still here, it's a miracle

The whole world full of serpents
If you cross me then you're cursed, man
Cut your face off like a surgeon
Off the grid, gone off detergents
I can't be seen, it's disturbing
I don't go out 'cause I'm nervous
I won't come back to this world, man
You wanna know what love is?
You wanna know what it feels like?
Wanted to see you in that light
Now I'm too deep in the night
I'm just ash now, I've been burning
When it's rain out, then I'm surfing
Know it's late now, but I'm learning
Everything calm on the surface

Lyrics:

[Intro]
You can't do it like me, do it like me
Can't do it like me

[Verse]
Fuck a double profit, triple that and go get it off it
If they want it, I might stock it
Can't see them now, I just block it
Use a pocket, fuck a wallet
Pocket watching, pic, I crop it
In Orlando, top, I drop it
Drop, I cop it, I should stop it
I won't make it, might Steve Jobs it
In the mall, tags popping
Blood is dripping on me, falling
Song recall it, now it's never dropping
Treat you like my brother, or my cousin, but you're undercover
Treat it like it's nothing, 'cause it wasn't, and it really wasn't
Might sleep in a coffin, but I wake up, might be drinking coffee
Get these people off me, get you off me, leave it like a crime scene
You might find a copy, but there's no one that can do it like me
Do it like me, do it like me
Misery loves company, so you should come hang with me
So come and hang with me, you should come hang with me
Soon I'll be like you, you see, I take the form I need
Trash on me, cost ten at least, don't speak, I sip my tea

You know that my soul's gone, but let me put this gold on
Gold on my girl in the dream world (Dream world)
Rainworld of angels, shadow reaper (Shadow reaper)

Release Date: April 24, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-sad-meal-lyrics
Song Description: SAD MEAL is the 6th song on Bladees 2024 album, Cold Visions. It has many references to the designer brands Bladee and his crew wear, with lines such as Lacoste on us, shit dont cost us.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
(Wake up, F1LTHY)
Hah, hah, hah (Cold Visions)

[Verse]
Feelings that I can't explain (One)
In an endless dark terrain
Through a tunnel under rain (Bladee)
There's a way that's not in vain
Through the sink and down the drain
Purple hat and purple cane
Doing magic, David Blaine
Changing faces, changing name
Through the sadness and the pain
Hit the gas, accelerate (Skrrt!)
Get the journalist to sign an NDA about our process
Loss and gain and I have gained a lot of losses, like a hill covered in crosses
Tommy Hilfiger the boxers
Lacoste on us, shit don't cost us
#Ad, shouts-out the sponsors
Brand-new face, shout-out my doctor
Fame has turned us into monsters
I went broke from doing concerts
Out of ten, what is the chances?
Can I still wear my Balenci'?
SG standing on Delancey
Dirty world, nothing is fancy
Leave you stranded out and canceled
Have you asking for an Advil
Have you signed up for a bad deal
At McDonald's, get the Sad Meal
Can't you see I face the challenge? (What?)
Zilli shoes, these not New Balance
D&GS don't get saddened
Out of you all, I'm the baddest
I'm addicted to my status
Let me tell you what the deal is
Honestly, I have no feelings
Life don't hit so this the remix
Everyone know I'm the realest
Every day is just another Monday morning, every day's the same
I wake up with my blinds down, golden light of day slipping away
I wake up wanting to go back to sleep but can't because the rain
Heavy rain falling forever on an everlasting flame
Heavy two-headed axe in a dirty duffel bag
Heavy hammers in the right hand, they can turn castles into sand
In the rain world, money system seeing how to scam the scam
On the stage going crazy, we're the new X Japan (C-C-C-C-Cold Visions)
I can't lose, only win, I'm so used to doing bad (Ha)
Please stop talking like you know me, bro, somebody get your mans (Stop that talking like you know me)
All the shit that I had been through, man, all I could say was "Damn" (Drain Gang)
'Course I'm running through the city, I do it because I can
Used to be so dirty, drug gang, I did it to collapse (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Used to wanna be so up but now you talk to the hand (Ha, ha, ha, ha)

I still remember the first time I realized that nothing's finе
I'm still remembering thе rise, since then, it's been a big decline
How could these cowards take my kindness for a weakness?

I'm getting bored of all this stressing
Back to flexing and finessing
Hanging with peasants (NPCs) gets depressing, I'm repping Crest (Crest, crest)

It's all I know
I know I'm falling off but, shit, I can't let go
I wipe my nose, it's all I know
Stumbling through the door and stumbling down
(There's something hidden in this riddle)
Between the lines, no, I'm just kidding
There's something cold about my vision
My fortune paints a ugly picture
If I should trust my intuition
I probably could do it different
To catch my drift, I'm going fishing
On my way back from going missing (Listen)
Should do the dishes in the kitchen (I'm back, ha)
But I am lacking the ambition
I let the neon diamonds glisten (Glisten, glisten)
I'm speaking codes so, baby, listen
This damn depression is my prison
Pink Floyd, the diamond is a prism (Prism)
Your threat towards us is nonexistent (Kill)
I'm in the hills, I'm pissing wishes
I give you everything, just listen (Listen)
SG malicious (Malicious business)
I got a funny disposition
Bust down the cross but I'm not Christian
I'm talking shit, cold visions, is it? (Cold visions)
(Listen)
Is it cold visions?
If you get hit then you get hit then
I'm being rude like a Parisian
I keep it true like I got 'tism
I'm in the sewers on a mission
Something was true in my suspicions
There's something brewing in the distance (It's bad)
Without getting into specifics
Let's address a couple issues
I'm fresh to death, I'm dressing different (Hahaha)
I'm truly sculpted in His image
Try catch these things from my perspective
Without getting into specifics
My hoodie on, I look suspicious
Your hidden talents, keep it hidden
Don't wanna see you be a victim
Don't wanna wake up and remember (Haha)
The visions colder than December

The blade be spinning like a blender (Bladee)
It's habit-forming, I'm dependent
No stainless steel in this here pendant
Tell them stop stealing my agenda
I'm pushing Drain Gang propaganda

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Still in the night, I should be knighted
You pay the member fee but you're still not invited
I get the feeling that you're braindead
They said I should've stayed dead, but the spotlight, I crave it
You only love me cause I'm famous
Turn up to the drainers, wake up all your neighbours
Had this sickness since the cradle
OG got me lazy, in traffic with Cady

[Chorus]
Reach in the well for a necklace
Blood on the moon, it's crescent
DG the new One Direction (One Direction)
Ten K, I count my blessings
Reach for the stars, am I destined? (Destined)
Burn a note into ash for the dragon (Dragon)
Bleed on the block for my brethren
Trash Star shining bright in dog heaven

[Verse 2]
Leave in the fall like I'm a dead leaf
I lost my memory, but it came back and drenched me
I have a feeling that I'm crazy (Crazy)
I know that they hate me, but they wanna be me
I roll up kushy in a dead leaf (Dead leaf)
Chilling at the Dead Sea, it's just me and Lusi

Title: Thee 9 Is Up
Release Date: May 28, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-thee-9-is-up-lyrics
Song Description: Bladee tell us that we need to trust ourselves when we find our path, whatever path we have chosen you have to know that you are going to be sad and wrong but that can not deviate us, these are part of the process (3(good) + 6(bad) = 9(complete)).  9(99) is a holy number and mentioned many times by Bladee. Thee means You in old English. The title can be interpreted as Your faith is up.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Do you still fancy me?
Answer me
What will you do if I find someone else?
You're lying
(Whatever)

[Chorus]
Told bro, "Let's rock"
We gon' climb up and get shieldy at the top
The bliss dont stop
I'm not Christian but I'm busting down the cross (Bust down)
The shield gon' lock
We put gates up and we double up on guards
The 9 is up
Work the wizard ways, I'm punching in the clock (Pew)

[Verse]
Greatness for us
If you believe in luck
Trust the sacred
Oh, just a touch, it's not enough
A place beyond the lust and temptations of love
Complete annihilation of us
Walk in light, see with anothеr eye
SG, we fortifiеd
I've been down bad trying to get back up
Had to make it worse, even more so
So, when I'm at my lowest, there's no other way
I'd only go up, I hope it's so
Fear of death and stress causes stress and fear of death
I can't lie, I must confess
Fear of death and stress causes stress and fear of death
I'm tryna see it as a test
I'm praying to God, please god may you bless me (Please God)
Still the same me but, baby, lately I've been messy
I must forgive myself before you can even forgive me
The shell is pretty, the Devil's busy
Oh, looks desperately for a sign, it's trials and tribulation time
The brave attempt fails and falls flat, he tries to take everything back
He's sure that something will go wrong, and that makes everything go wrong
But still the hope it's strong (The road is long you must go on)

Upgraded on them quick, give me migraine

Brain freeze, I'm in the east by the palm trees

I let my light get away

But it's too late anyways

[Verse 1: Bladee]
I'm a fiend, you won't see me out in public
For a fortune, I can bless your track, I'll touch it
And I touch down overseas but that was nothin'
Might have known him in the past, but now I crush him
Me and Adamn gettin' commas like it's nothin'
Fallin' in the club off a pill and Robitussin
Send your girl emojis, now she's blushin'
If I send her real words, so now she's crushin'
And I'm wearing Dolce, it's disgusting
Pack just came in, gave me a concussion
He say he's a friend but I don't trust him
I can't trust a soul if I don't love them

But we're trendier than them (Haha)

[Verse 1]
Kill a part of you that's not true to the heart of you
Pull a joker card on you, I didn't mean to startle you
I pulled off, it was not enough, I left a scar on you
I guess that game wasn't hard enough, sorry to bother you
This drain life, it will harden you, might make a martyr out of you (Haha)
I might walk a lonely road, but I walk the road I choose
The fame and the glory is what came from the pleasures and the pain
(Memories will never fade and the traumas will remain)

[Bridge]
I want innocence, Snow White
Want innocence
I want innocence, Snow White
The way she shines her light
You'll always be by my side
And I'll walk forward with pride
And as legends never die
Live forever through the times

Song Description: Puppet Master is the penultimate track off Swedish rapper Bladees Red Light album.

The track takes the shape of a melodic beat produced by Whitearmor, and is perhaps the most emotional song of all from Bladees 2018 project.

The whispers at the beginning of the song are sampled from the greeting of a well-known Japanese ASMRtist named hatomugi. She says Domo, Hatomugi desu.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
ども、ハトムギです
I wanted to be real, wanted to be real

[Verse]
I'm the winner but I feel like a victim
Graduated from the situation, found a solution
Smoking on the pollution, all black suit
Black gloves on, just like a hitman
Trash Star Boys and we sleep in a coffin
Wake up, drinking coffee
I get to it often, might get to it this morning
Prada boots on, look like some Jordans
I'm playing, I'm scoring
DG, Nike, they supporting
Just do it, blade on me, I'm swording
I'm veiled when I'm wielding
Knife in my heart but, man, fuck how I'm feeling
Can't look at me, you're dreaming
Can't even see me when you are sleeping
Black Volvo, we're creeping

[Chorus]
I had ups and downs but it's falling into place
Like the love from God when you look me in my face
I had dreams of life that were lost in empty space
I had almost drowned if I didn't fuck with that drain
I had four, five strikes, at the sixth I lost my wings

We pull up on BMX bikes like the Fab 5
So I walked up in the mall right, did the swipe, swipe
Then I gave away my Moncler in the sacrifice
It's kinda funny 'cause you're so mad and IDGAF
I just wanna have fun
Im switching styles up with the season
Need no reason to, I just do whatever I like
Too many times they tried to do me dirty
Make me feel like I'm not worthy of what I've got

Got a ghost in my basement
He come out when it's raining
Fuck your team, you're all leeching
Want a feature? You're reaching
Hundred thousand, we speaking
Nails in coffins for treason
He got played, he's a sucker
You should look out for each other

[Chorus]
I'm gonna make you fall in love
Spikes on my shoes, stepped in blood
I told my dudes, "Don't give up"
But we all know that we're all fucked
I'm on glue, shit, don't get stuck
But I got drugs like I'm the plug

Title: Jaws
Release Date: December 29, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-jaws-lyrics
Song Description: Originally releasing as a mix on Cartier GODs Soundcloud, a frequent collaborator with the Drain king (Bladee). The original mix sounds much different, with an addition of a Cartier GOD feature at the end of the mix. It was also originally called Jaws (Money In Motion)

By the time the tape was released, Cartier GOD was removed from the song and added to the end of the song preceding this one, titled Close. Cartier GOD also has an entire interlude after Jaws. This was most likely a last minute decision to have Bladee as the solo artist on this heavy hitting song.

Release Date: September 21, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-doorman-lyrics

[Chorus]
Been around, still around the finish line
Background check them 'fore they come around
Drain Gang tree house and you're not allowed
Dead tree branches and they hanging down
I smell the money, gotta hunt it down
Still talking 'bout me, you gotta cut it out
They're moving sideways but it's going south
You remind me of someone that I forgot about
It's getting crazy in the haunted house
I might pop out and sleep on the couch
Used to have demons but we're homies now
Used to be on some shit but it's over now

[Verse]
I'm on the phone and it's over out
You've been tryna run into me on my coldest night
I can't go if it's not feeling right
And I'm in the dark tunnel but I see a light
It's a hard day, I might get an upgrade
I get the stop made even when I'm up late
Been a long way, it really came a long way
Might get a heartbreak swimming in the dark lake
They call me Boss BladeeCity where the sword lays
I've seen a late night turn into a morning
I know you hate me but it's not important
I know 'bout death 'cause it's waiting at my doorstep
This is not fake so you can't afford it
I can't have fans 'round 'cause they wanna record me
I'm in your city, that's another story
I fuck my real life up 'cause that shit bore me
I'm in some Air Force, can't do Michael Jordan's
I know you hate me, I'm working when you're snoring
And I've been global so there's nothing foreign
They know my name, I am buddies with the doorman

Title: WODRAINER
Release Date: April 24, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-wodrainer-lyrics
Song Description: The song WODRAINER is like a rollercoaster ride through lifes ups and downs. Its all about struggling to figure things out and feeling like youre constantly hitting roadblocks. Theres this vibe of buying stuff and trying to escape reality, but also this deep search for who you really are and where you fit in. The lyrics talk about dealing with tough stuff like trauma and feeling all alone, but they also show this gritty determination to keep going, no matter what. Its like saying, Yeah, lifes rough, but Im not giving up. And even in the messiness of it all, theres this sense of finding meaning and purpose through creativity and expression.
Lyrics:

[Intro]

Must be nice
Dirty-ass Eastpak backpack, blood money in a trash bag (My life)
I bought a thousand Smurfs on Ebay, I was on shrooms needless to say (It's my life)
I'm the rain king, can't stop the rain
I'm having traumatic flashbacks
I'm in the airport, fast track (C-C-C-Cold Visions)
Trying everything, I'm a lab rat (True?)
Say you love me, elaborate on that
Say I'm nothing, I'm even beyond that
Speaking the truth and then I become that
C'est la vie, go tell your mom that
Know I fell off, but this is the comeback
Drain Gang follow the code, we honor that (Follow the code)
Walk in the store, I want all of that
Icedancer, I'm living in Disney Land
So much designer, got sick of that
So much designer, we been in that
Put it in the trash, we binning that (Let's put it in the bin)
Let's leave it at that (Lame ass fit)

Tony when he was in the club
He was sitting all fucked up

I drain better than— (Drain)

Lyrics:

[Intro]
They're trying to make me distracted
This is not a diss-track, but I don't like that (It's crazy)
S-Spin around like a nine it gave me whiplash
C-Come so fresh, so clean, out of the birdbath


[Verse 1]
Every time I fall am I bound to get back up?
You've been lying to me and that's messed up
You don't know how I feel, put your crest up (Crest)
Dream inside of a dream, had to rest up
Give you-give you something to believe in
I got that something that you've been seeking
And I wait for the fall
But this Drain Story is about to reach my favorite part

[Bridge]
(I'ma pour up a drink, baby, here's to you)
(You know who you are, it's been too long)

[Verse 2]
Locking in with the forcеs, didn't have to force it
Took the door off thе door hinges (Yeah)
Can't-Can't fit in with the normies
If being Drainy is a sin, Lord, forgive me
Thaiboy Goon, shake the room, baby
I'm going crazy, screws loose, baby
You don't know me, have you checked the news lately?
I should've told you about the truth, but I was too lazy
You're always trying to tell me something serious but it's a joke to me
But it's only funny when we tell it, otherwise it's not fun
And it's only priceless until you put a price on it

[Intro: Bladee]
Ah
(Cold Visions)

[Verse 1: Bladee]
Hash from Norway, twice the price
Half alive and sleep deprived
Nothing works, but sleep don't hurt
Dirty life, baptized in dirt
In my soul, a growing hole
Void that spreads out of control
Panic, that became the norm
Out of fear, a child is born
Only calm once in the storm
Faith in stars I can't afford
Time pass by and brought me more
Yet, I'm weaker than before
Learned some more and lost some more
But I know less than before
And on stage, I am a—
And I hold my face to floor
Dance on the edge of the blade
To do a raid on the ravе
We burn some sage just in casе
Toxic waste to the face (Yes, sir)
We in V6s, no plates
We burnin' through the terrain
Fuck what it is, does it hit?
I got so rich off the spit
I post a pic, now you're pissed
I'll put your friends on the list
I'll pay your rent for the year
Take care of you when you're sick
I'll throw myself in a ditch (Ah)
I'll hurt myself if you wish
Crawling in the sewer with an axe on the side
Dark tinted windows on the whip, let's ride
Alligator shoes, everything reptile
Only I can talk about the night, it's mine (Working on dying)
Searching for destruction under blue street lights (F1LTHY, what's up, man? Been working on dying, man)
Hoodie on my head, sunglasses, dress shoes tied (It's crazy)
Seen so many friends that strayed from the light
Baby, is it fine?

Thuggin' in the field by my lone (Lone)

I got racks in my pocket like a phone
With the gang, know we flyer than a drone
I'm with the gang, throwin' up 4s, yellin', "Shalom" (Shalom)
I'm with twin, locked in, that's my clone
Me and Bladee start to sing like some crows
Take 'em through the Swedish woods, they gon' know
Pop out with my gang through the trees like some creatures
KTS the scene (Scene), leave 'em bloody, but we ain't gon' bleach it
Euro coupe screechin'
Bloody like some leeches

Title: LOVESTORY
Release Date: April 8, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-lovestory-lyrics
Song Description: LOVESTORY is a euphoric track of infatuation, connection and living out romantic fantasy. Unlike their usual approach to themes of love/romance, Bladee & Ecco2k share with us a gently worded, poppy ballad, only slightly alluding to the superficial and transient elements of such a perfect lovestory. It is one of two tracks from the album to have an accompanying music video.

In early 2014, Ecco2k tweeted the title of this song. Ecco2k has been known to leak certain lyrics or titles through various Twitter accounts.
Lyrics:

[Refrain: Ecco2k]
Everything came back to me
Every path leads back to you again
Everything came back to me
Every path leads back to you again

Perfect details
Everyone thinks it's so special
And it feels like

Title: Fake News
Release Date: May 11, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-fake-news-lyrics
Song Description: The fourth song off Bladees project Red Light takes the shape of one of the slower-paced tracks, on which Bladee provides a dreamy, emotional hook and a powerful, sombre verse.

'Fake News as a term has blown up due to the popularisation of the word with 45th U.S. President Donald Trump.
Rapper Bladee is not exactly one to shy away from pop culture references.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
You make me feel so blue
I know I'm not perfect, but what about you?
I know I do wrong, but I know you do too
But I feel so worthless standing next to you
You wanna buy verses, but I can't sell you
I'm talking to myself, it's enough to hate you
I wanna get up but I'm coming down soon
Put me on my back, bring me down like a flu

[Verse]
I'm walking until my heels bleed, tryna find you
They tell me I shouldn't worry but it's fake news
You're acting so cold to me but it burns too
I am not myself so don't take it personal
Something like twenty thousand, what we burn through
Prada walking backwards, two times I curse you
Prada walking backwards, two times I curse you
I am not myself so don't take it personal
Prada walking, dirty dancing
I don't know if she flirting when she says I'm handsome
I am not myself, I'm just acting
I can feel the static, good dog catch the rabbit
Money, I'm an addict, ghost in the attic
Trashman, I manage to trash, I say trash it
Black leather jacket, I need that, the package
They want it, my precious, it's cut like my ex's
On the stretchers, bed boy, I'm bedded
Good night, I'm resting, search the alley
Smoke rolling in, I'ma let it, fuck it

Title: ICARUS 3REESTYLE
Release Date: September 30, 2022, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-icarus-3reestyle-lyrics
Song Description: ICARUS 3REESTYLE features Bladee exploring themes of life, hardships, and success over a psychedelic instrumental.

In Greek mythology, Icarusthe son of the master craftsman Daedaluswas known for his attempt to fly using wings made out of feathers and wax. His father warned him not to soar too close to the sun or the water as it would ruin his wings, but he ignored these cautions. Like Daedalus advised, Icarus' wings melteda result of flying towards the suncausing him to plunge into the sea and drown. This story is told as a lesson of complacency, which Bladee also touches on in this track.

The Guz Reichwald-directed music video released the same day as Spiderr, and features Bladee in the streets of Manchester, Connecticut.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Three plus three plus three is nine
D, it's me, SG (D9)
Create it as I speak, STE
(This is nine, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Hero of my story, death or glory in the inner city
Baby, it’s the smaller things in life that really make a difference
Best believe it never was a joke, but I was always kidding
Cinderella only for one night, the shoe was really fitting
See me when I'm walking through the glue, it sure do get sticky
DG9 is ugly in the street, gotta make it pretty (Damn)
Navigate the mystery, we pull reality out of fiction
Takes more than ambition, I can show you, you don't have to listen

[Chorus]
I paint a perfect picture, strike that, a beautiful image
It’s obviously number nine, something that words can't describe
I'll always be by your side, inside a city of light
And in my way falling down (Inside a city of light)

[Verse 2]
Ah, raise the bar, they're obviously not up to par
I look up at the sky and I wish upon a star
Guess they like how I talk on the songs, turn it to a art
SG creep in the night after eight when it's dark
Blessings coming in by the truck, told 'em, "Load it up"
Very special numbers on the crest, I have to hold it up
I tried to tell 'em we're not special, but still, they idolize us
You might catch me in the grocery store or riding on the bus
Ah, I’ll start to blush
Perfection is just an illusion and a punishment of love
I’m standing solid every season, but it's not solid enough
Baby, you can kill me with a touch, I’m flying too close to the sun

Lock eyes with a beautiful girl and she's not scared of him

Fuck the system, Rainworld, money system
Ten years of solitude made me independent

Title: Botox Lips
Release Date: August 7, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-botox-lips-lyrics
Song Description: Botox Lips is the 14th track on Drain Gangs collaborative album D&G. Although the album itself was released in 2017, the official visual for Botox Lips came out a year later, coinciding with the 2018 release of Bladees EP Sunset in Silver City. The cover art for this EP features an edited still from the Botox Lips music video (or visual interpretation, as its titled on YouTube). The video originally included the description balcony performance (excerpt from a dream), but this was later removed. The song itself sees Bladee delve into his relationship problems with a melancholic vocal delivery, accompanied by an experimental and atmospheric beat showcasing Whitearmors signature production style.
Lyrics:

[Intro]

Yeah, I'm wicked, that's my only weakness
You gon' leave me speechless, I can't beat this fever
Yeah, I'm speeding, I am off the meter
I am not a dreamer, I could be your teacher
Nice to meet you, wouldn't wanna be you
For you I am see through
Can't you see I need you?
I can treat you good if I can reach you
In the night I beep you, like I'm R2-D2

[Pre-Chorus]
20 stacks, I spent that on trees
And you can't smoke that with me
You can't even talk to me, my agency need a fee
Got the gift, God gave it to me
They wanna take it from me
What do you want me to be?
Make a wish and turn into me

Lowkey, you're better off being broke
Having success is not that dope
Being in LA off that coke
Surrounded by people I don't even know

Lyrics:

[Intro]
All or Nothing

[Verse 1: Bladee]
One touch will affect you
Insect Crew, venom, I infect you
Thaiboy Goon is who I'm next to
And you thought you was with the crew, we finessed you
I'm at Central, meet me by the restroom
Hit my plug for the drugs, I hope he comes soon
Ice cream, boy, we melt you
I was in the spider web but I fell through
Had a dream that I wasn't gonna make it
It made me weak, I'll forget it when I'm faded
I'm in the streets, I'm just waiting for a payment
What you want from me? She want me but I can't save her
We're off pills and weed

[Chorus: Bladee]
You don't wanna try me tonight
I got the knife on me now
You don't wanna die tonight
Butterfly is on me tonight
It makes you fly to the sky
Do you wanna fly tonight?
You don't wanna try me tonight
I got the knife on me now

Me and my homies on the way
We do this everyday
SG, that's my way
Shouts out to all my mistakes
Never seen these Apes
Now I'm feeling well, I'm 'bout to flex the whole day
Flex it, made it made, flex it, made a million
When I'm running 'round in the Stockholm with the drain
People trying to say
They don't know what's up, try and take you far away, away
I could have graduated from Yale
But young Thaiboy chose the fame, fame
Ayy

Song Description: Here Bladee sings about partying with the kind of women that his fame has now afforded him. The stark opening line in particular and slightly forlorn feeling of the production suggest that his indulging in these women isnt precisely what he needs, and might be only a palliative measure against his Traumas of the past

Lyrics:

[Intro]
First time, first time like a virgin
I'm a fiend for the drugs, who is serving?
They want to be me like they're Kirby
But I'm too advanced, it's not working
I come from the rain, are you thirsty?
I'm in love with pain, someone cursed me

[Verse 1]
Take a chance with me, is it worth it?
I'm gonna stay up 'til it's not even that early
Every time I get a chance, it gets out of hand
Burning through the grams to the point where it gets sad
I'm still in the land where nobody understand
But I'm with the gang, and they know that it gets bad
Fucked it up again when I'm fucked up off a Xan
What the fuck is happening tonight? What's the plan?
They don't wanna see me make it to the top
But I'm feeling like I'm being watched
Everywhere I go, I'm staying locked
But I got the key on me, it's hot
I don't wanna go out 'til it's dark
I've been goin', goin' to the stars
They don't wanna see me getting guap

My crystals got you spellbound (Spellbound)
All my music's gonna sell out

[Verse]
Prada Sport, Lamborghini doors, I'm prepared to fall
Snowboard on my MasterCard, I shine like a star
Coast guard, surfin' Hollister, I'm in money world
Rainworld, I would get some pearl if I had a girl
Finish work, always in the dirt but it wash off
Hammer to the game, make it break like asphalt
Gucci on my belt, greenfield, playing Counter-Strike
Kush in my Nikes and I'm high and I'm in the night

All my music's gonna sell out

[Chorus]
Money got me spellbound (Money got me spellbound)
My crystals got you spellbound (My crystals got you spellbound)
All my music's gonna sell out (All my music's gonna sell out)
Hit the mall in the sunshine (In the sun)
Money got me spellbound (Got me spellbound)
My crystals got you spellbound (Spellbound)
All my music's gonna sell out (Sell out)
Hit the mall in the sunshine (In the sun)

[Outro]
Hit the mall in the sunshine, hit the mall in the sunshine
Hit the mall in the sunshine (Sunshine), my crystals got you spellbound
Hit the mall in the sunshine, hit the mall in the sunshine

Lyrics:

[Intro: Bladee]
Heavy lies the crown, heaven wants me now
Love is hard to find, but it's Friday night
Heavy lies the crown, heaven wants me now
Love is hard to find, but it's Friday night

[Chorus: Bladee]
Heavy lies the crown, heaven wants me now
Love is hard to find, but it's Friday night
Heavy lies the crown, heaven wants me now
Love is hard to find, but it's Friday night

[Verse 1: Bladee]
I remember Stockholm in the summertime
I remember Sunday but I'm smokin' now (Dope)
Whenever I see you, girl, I want you now
Woke up in my city but I'm comin' down
Walk up with the razorblade, it's on me now (Go, go)
But I'm always poppin' just to calm me down
Callin' all my demons so they come around (Soldiers)
I wanted forever but it's all for naught
For naught, for naught
It's all they know, but it's still the crown

Heaven wants me now, love is hard to find

You know how it is, you know how it goes
I remember seein' you, Friday night at the high school

[Bridge: Black Kray]
Uh, yeah
You're the sunshine through my daylight
You're the sunshine through my nighttime
Sunshine through my daylight
You're the sunshine through my nighttime
Sunshine through my daylight (Friday night)
You're the sunshine through my nighttime (Friday night)

Title: WONDERLAND
Release Date: April 8, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Bladee-wonderland-lyrics
Song Description: This is the second track of EXETER, and one of two tracks on the record that feature close collaborator and fellow Drain member Ecco2k. In this track, the two artists capture an overall sound similar to that of Ecco2ks debut album E packed with hypnotic, bouncy synth and minimalistic drums.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Ecco2k]
Acid eat through my teeth, ultraviolets, infrareds
Break into a thousand pieces, I feel like Ravenhead
Innocence and evil superglued together
Swallowing my feelings tastes like sweetness
Acid eat through my teeth, ultraviolets, infrareds
Break into a thousand pieces, I feel like Ravenhead
Innocence and evil superglued together
Swallowing my feelings tastes like sweetness

[Verse 1: Bladee]
If you were to tell a story, how would it go?
Would I be in it? Yes or no?
It feels like springtime in my mind
It feels like summer all the time (Oh)
Wonderland
Wonderland (Oh)
Wonderland
Wonderland (Oh)

[Verse 2: Bladee & Ecco2k]
Give love a chance
I break the wall (I break the wall)
When I wish upon a star (When I wish upon a star)
And they look in awe (Look in awe)
Aw man, yeah, I did it for the art (For the art)
Yeah, I'm charged up (Trash Star)
Charged up, you can say I'm starstruck (Starstruck)
I go in the night
Just to make it work out (Just to make it work out)
