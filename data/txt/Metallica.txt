Artist: Metallica
Artist Description: Like Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden before, Metallica has managed to transcend the genre from which it originated. To their metal fanbase they are considered one of the Big Four bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer; however Metallica is also one of the most commercially successful bands in all of rock music, having sold 110 million records, including the 16x platinum Metallica, which stands as both the highest selling metal album of all time and one of the most successful albums of the modern age.

Metallica was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles, after drummer Lars Ulrich placed an ad in the classifieds which was answered by singer/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield. They were soon joined by lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, who later formed Megadeth after being kicked out of the band due to substance abuse, and bassist Ron McGovney, a childhood friend of Hetfield. These two early members were replaced with Cliff Burton—who relocated the band to San Francisco—and ex-Exodus lead guitarist, Kirk Hammett, to form the band’s classic line-up.

They released three albums, 1983’s Kill ‘Em All, 1984’s Ride The Lightning and 1986’s Master of Puppets, before the tragic and untimely death of Cliff Burton on September 27, 1986.

The band chose to go on and, after lengthy auditions, selected Flotsam And Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted. They produced 1988’s Grammy nominated …And Justice For All, which included the 1989 Grammy winning single “One.” The bleak and overtly complex nature of the album inspired the band to seek a stylistic change. With Mötley Crüe producer Bob Rock, Metallica recorded the more mainstream sounding self-titled fifth album, Metallica. Released in 1991 and featuring various successful singles, the so-called “Black Album” launched them to commercial success as stadium rock staples.

The rest of the 1990s saw Metallica releasing more blues-influenced hard rock with 1996’s Load and its companion album, 1997’s Reload.  While the band’s creative output during this period was markedly different from their earlier metal roots, they continued to sell out stadiums, top charts, and push the boundaries of rock music; both Load and Reload debuted at number one on the US Billboard charts, while the 1999 live album, S&M, featured the San Francisco Symphony orchestra in a daring cross-genre move.

This era was not all positive; Lars Ulrich found himself at the center of a war with file-sharing network Napster and was later hospitalized following anxiety attacks while on tour. James Hetfield also checked into rehab to deal with alcohol abuse. After an infamous Playboy magazine interview in 2001, Jason Newsted left the band; Bob Rock covered bass duties during the recording sessions for 2003’s St. Anger. With lyrics conveying the band’s angst—as documented in the 2004 documentary Some Kind of Monster—and a controversial sound change featuring no solos and poor drum audio, St. Anger achieved commercial success, but was widely criticized by reviewers and fans. For the tour, the bassist role was eventually filled by Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves and Ozzy Osbourne’s band; with the latter taking Newsted as his bassist.

In the aftermath of St. Anger, as well as a resurgence in the popularity of metal, the band decided to return to their earlier roots and in 2008 released their ninth studio album, the Rick Rubin-produced Death Magnetic. The album was critically appraised and again debuted at #1 on the US Billboard chart, making them the first band to have five consecutive debuts at that position.

On April 4, 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

Their tenth album, Hardwired… To Self-Destruct, was released on November 18, 2016. It received good reviews and topped the Billboard 200, making them one of four artists with six #1 debuts—the second group after the Dave Matthews Band; the overall record is seven by Kanye West.

Title: One
Release Date: August 25, 1988, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-one-lyrics
Song Description: The fourth track on Metallicas And Justice for All, is based on the novel Johnny Got His Gun by Dalton Trumbo. There, Joe Bonham, a soldier in World War I, is hit by a landmine explosion that takes away his limbs and face, and becomes a prisoner in his own body  Joe lost his senses and cant communicate, but is still kept alive by the medical crew. Thus the lyrics follow his plea to be put out of his misery.

A specific passage that inspired the song is:

How could a man lose as much of himself as I have and still live? When a man buys a lottery ticket you never expect him to win because its a million to one shot. But if he does win, youll believe it because one in a million still leaves one. If Id read about a guy like me in the paper I wouldnt believe it, cos its a million to one. But a million to ONE always leaves one. Id never expect it to happen to me because the odds of it happening are a million to one. But a million to one always leaves one. One.

One marked the first time Metallica did a music video for one of their songs. The video featured footage from the film adaptation of Johnny Got His Gun directed by Trumbo himself, which the band bought the rights for to make incorporating it easier.
Lyrics:

[Spoken Intro]
"Fuckin' coward! Get your ass out of that trench!
Move, move, move, move, move!
Oh shit, oh fuck!

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be

All that I see, absolute horror

Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell

Title: Nothing Else Matters
Release Date: August 12, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-nothing-else-matters-lyrics
Song Description: On their controversial self-titled album which came to be known as the Black Album, Nothing Else Matters was perhaps the greatest example of the new Metallica sound that alienated core fans. Frontman James Hetfield had been taking classical guitar lessons and wanted to show off his fingerpicking skills in the introduction. The song grew out of an extension of a phone call James made with his girlfriend while on tour and he was picking his guitar while on the phone.

While the song does get heavy during the second guitar solo, it is for the most part, a ballad about expressing your feelings, like an Emerson poem:

It was a song for myself in my room on tour when I was bumming out about being away from home. Its quite amazing, its a true testament to honesty and exposing yourself, putting your real self out there, and taking the risk, taking a gamble that someones either going to step on your heart with spikes on or theyre going to put their heart right next to it, and you never know until you try. That solidified, I think, that we were doing the right thing, writing from the heart about what we felt, and you cant go wrong that way.

Nothing Else Matters has become a song that any complete beginner who has never picked up a guitar can feel like they are playing Metallica for a few measures.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAGnKpE4NCI

Famed Hollywood composer Michael Kamen contributed an orchestrated part, which was mixed somewhat low in the song. To compensate, years later Metallica did the S&M concert and album with Kamen conducting the San Francisco Symphony, with Nothing Else Matters being a centerpiece and single.

Title: Enter Sandman
Release Date: July 29, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-enter-sandman-lyrics
Song Description: The lead single from Metallicas commercially successful self-titled album, Enter Sandman was certified platinum, selling over 1 million copies.  The song was Metallicas biggest radio hit and its considered their signature song.

The song follows the theme of childhood fear, in nightmares, with the eponymous Sandman symbolizing the sleep that he dreads.  However, the Sandman of European folklore actually represents the bringer of good dreams.

In 2007, drummer Lars Ulrich told Uncut:

Enter Sandman was the first thing we came up with when we sat down for the songwriting process in July 1990. The 10-minute, 12-tempo-changes side of Metallica had run its course. We wanted to streamline and simplify things. We wrote the song in a day or two. All the bits of Enter Sandman are derived from the main riff.

Meanwhile, James Hetfield told Uncut:

I wanted more of the mental thing where this kid gets manipulated by what adults say. You know when you wake up with that shit in your eye? Thats supposedly been put in there by the sandman to make you dream. So the guy in the song tells this little kid that and he kinda freaks. He cant sleep after that and it works the opposite way. Instead of a soothing thing, the tables turned.

Twenty years after the songs release, producer Bob Rock shared the original concept of the songs lyrics with Music Radar:

At first, based on the music and the riff, the band and their management thought it could be the first single. Then they heard James lyrics and realized the song was about crib death. That didnt go over well. I sat down with James and talked to him about his words. I told him, What you have is great, but it can be better. Does it have to be so literal? Not that I was thinking about the single; I just wanted him to make the song great. It was a process, him learning to say what he wanted but in a more poetic and open sort of way. He rewrote some lyrics and it was all there the first single.
Lyrics:

Title: Master of Puppets
Release Date: March 3, 1986, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-master-of-puppets-lyrics
Song Description: The title track off Metallicas seminal Master of Puppets album is about the negative effects drugs can have on a persons life, written from the perspective of the drug itself. It is the single most performed song in Metallicas career, and always provides a great reaction from audiences, as Hetfield will leave the singing of the MASTER! exclamations to the audience (to great effect!).

The guitar riff between the last guitar solo section and final verse was heavily influenced by David Bowies song Andy Warhol, which Burton and Hammett were big fans of.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

Title: The Unforgiven
Release Date: August 12, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-the-unforgiven-lyrics
Song Description: A metal ballad co-written by Ulrich, Hammett and Hetfield. This song is about the struggles he had with religion-related to his moms death. His relatives did not want to give Jamess mom the treatment she needed because they thought God would help her through it. He starts to question the legitimacy of religion.

The horn sound intro was taken from the movie score of the appropriately titled The Unforgiven, and reversed, for legal reasons.

Hetfields singing was inspired by Chris Isaaks in Wicked Game. He was used to screaming, not singing.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
New blood joins this earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules
With time, the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on, he's known
Ooh, a vow onto his own, that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

[Verse 2]
They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win

Title: Fade to Black
Release Date: July 27, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-fade-to-black-lyrics
Song Description: Fade to Black is a powerful ballad about a man that wants to commit suicide, and eventually does it. The depressive lyrics regarding someone with suicidal desires were inspired by James Hetfields first Marshall amplifier, which his mother helped him get before she died, being stolen just before the album was recorded.
Lyrics:

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

[Bridge]
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
(Goodbye)

Song Description: Metallicas take on Hemingways novel of the same name about the reproach of modern warfare and the combatants impending demise during the Spanish Civil War.



This continues their string of literary adaptations that runs from the Bible through Dalton Trumbo.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Make his fight, on the hill, in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run, through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill — Why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive, through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

[Chorus]
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone, except the will to be

Title: Creeping Death
Release Date: July 27, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-creeping-death-lyrics
Song Description: Based on the story of the first Passover from the Book of Exodus, Creeping Death is a brutal retelling of the story of the Angel Of Death. When the Pharaoh refused to release the Hebrew slaves, God sent down an angel to take the lives of every firstborn child, unless the house was marked with the blood of a blemish-free lamb.

The title came from a comment bassist Cliff Burton made while watching the film The Ten Commandments.

The guitar riff in the bridge was written by lead guitarist Kirk Hammett when he was only 16 years old, and was originally used in the Exodus song Die By His Hand.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Slaves, Hebrews born to serve, to the Pharaoh
Heed to his every word, live in fear
Faith of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait, something must be done, four-hundred years

[Chorus]
So let it be written, so let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written, so let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son, I'm creeping death

[Verse 2]
Now, let my people go, land of Goshen
Go, I will be with thee bush of fire
Blood, running red and strong down the Nile
Plague, darkness three days long, hail to fire

[Verse 3]
I rule the midnight air, the destroyer

Blood, lamb's blood-painted door I shall pass

Title: Sad but True
Release Date: August 12, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-sad-but-true-lyrics
Song Description: The fifth and final single released from Metallicas seminal self-titled album, Sad But True is about a persons darker side taking control.

Influenced by the 1978 horror film Magic, starring Anthony Hopkins, the song is a monologue justifying the existence of this darker side, which in the film is symbolized by a foul-mouthed ventriloquists dummy.

The song has been interpreted as an allusion to addiction, a struggle Hetfield has been open about, having previously entered rehab for alcohol and other addictionsanother being chocolate.

Title: Ride the Lightning
Release Date: July 27, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-ride-the-lightning-lyrics
Song Description: Metallicas gut-wrenching Ride The Lightning is about spending your final moments in an electric chair. The title was taken from Stephen Kings The Stand.

We just got into some social topics. The death penalty was a big question and the electric chair. Thats heavy. What if that was you, mistakenly? Thats what that song was about, being accidentally found guilty and put to death with no way to stop it. It was just a matter of putting myself into other peoples situations and trying to get these feelings out.

James Hetfield, Rolling Stone
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Guilty as charged, but dammit, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air, strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you"?

[Chorus]
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

[Verse 2]
Wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold, as I watch death unfold
Consciousness, my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?

Burning hard, loose and clean

Title: ...And Justice for All
Release Date: August 25, 1988, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-and-justice-for-all-lyrics
Song Description: This is the title track off of Metallicas 4th album. This song deals with how the rich and powerful corrupt justice and the legal system and abuse for their own ends much to the detriment of the poor and vulnerable.

Long and dour, the song remained out of circulation in Metallica concerts following the 1988-89 Justice tour because as Kirk Hammett put,  I couldnt stand watching the front row start to yawn by the eight or ninth minute. Only 19 years later, in 2008, it returned to the setlist. And its presence in all but one in the Metallica by Request tour (where fans picked what would be played) shows And Justice for All found its audience eventually.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Halls of justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower

[Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price
You pay

[Chorus]
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[Verse 2]
Apathy their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity, so deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns, hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

[Verse 3]
Lady justice has been raped, truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips, now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again, make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell, cannot feel

[Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price

[Chorus]

Title: Welcome Home (Sanitarium)
Release Date: March 3, 1986, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-welcome-home-sanitarium-lyrics
Song Description: Keeping with the grim nature of Master of Puppets with songs about being manipulated, mistreated, abused, etc., this song is about being mentally abused in an insane asylum, which as early as Ten Days in a Mad-House was shown as a place that treats interns horribly. The songs inspiration comes from the other famous work about an asylum, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "rage"?

[Chorus]
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Title: Blackened
Release Date: August 25, 1988, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-blackened-lyrics
Song Description: On Blackened, James Hetfield gives a morbid account of what the future could hold for planet earth. Although this song was written in the 1980s during the Cold War era, the lyrics still hold true today. Mutually Assured Destruction was a commonly discussed political topic at the time, however the lyrics suggest that M.A.D. is hypocritical, contradictory to fixing the real problem, and that carrying it out only serves to bring about the death of all life on our planet via nuclear winter. The term blackened actually means to scar by burning, decay or bruising  You can imagine hundreds of sudden nuclear weapon detonations scarring the Earth forever  blackening it. James gets political on this track, and spins the topic into a killer thrash metal song.

Like all other songs on And Justice for All, Blackened contains so many layered guitar tracks to the point where it drowns out the bass sound (funnily making Newsteds first practical bass contribution take place on the subsequent Black Album). It starts out with monsterous riffs that break into a half-time long interlude where Kirk Hammett unleashes one of his best solos, only to go back into double-time and go back to the monstrous riffing duties.

This song features Newsteds only writing credits on the whole album, as he wrote the main riff.

The song would years later name Metallicas own label, Blackened Recordings.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Blackened is the end, winter it will send
Throwing all you see into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth, never her rebirth
Evolution's end, never will it mend

[Chorus]
Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

[Verse 2]
Blistering of Earth, terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill, nothing left to kill
Never seen before, breathing nevermore

Title: Battery
Release Date: March 3, 1986, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-battery-lyrics
Song Description: The opening track on Master of Puppets, widely regarded as the apex of the thrash genre, Battery begins with a menacing, ascending classical guitar riff. It escalates from there into a frenzied uptempo crusher, which pays homage to Metallicas loyal fans. The fans are the battery that gives them the power to rock.

Also, there were some clubs on Battery St. in San Francisco, where Metallica did most of their damage in the early days.

Battery St. Thats where a lot of our life was lived, you know? it just felt like a home, this is where we get our energy!

James Hetfield, Its Electric
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me

[Verse 2]
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Lay beside me and tell me what they've done
And speak the words I wanna hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you
Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining

Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

[Verse 2]
Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone

Title: Dyers Eve
Release Date: August 25, 1988, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-dyers-eve-lyrics
Song Description: Dyers Eve, one of the thrashiest tracks on And Justice For All, is its closer. It takes the format of an angry, accusatory letter penned by the hand of a child whose fragile psyche was wounded during the developmental phase of life by the very ones who were supposed to be protecting and guiding him.

The lyrics are a rant from James Hetfield against his parents. His father left the family when James was only 13 years old and his mother died of cancer when he was 16. She refused treatment because of her beliefs as a Christian Scientist. James also felt his parents had never allowed him to discover the world for himself because their religion encouraged insulating and alienating.

When Rolling Stone told Hetfield you never fell into the I-hate-my-parents and I-hate-school cliches, he responded:

There is one song I can specifically disagree with you on, Dyers Eve. There is a lot of blame in that song  That song was about being in a cocoon, and now that Im out on my own, oh, my God, the world is shocking me. I dont know how to deal with this stuff. I dont know how to deal with grief, poverty, confrontation. How to live on my own, after father leaving, mother dying.

The band did not perform this song live in its entirety until March 5, 2004 when they played it at the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles during Metallicas Madly in Anger with the World tour.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Dear mother, dear father
What is this hell you have put me through?
Believer, deceiver
Day in, day out, lived my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life

Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator, dictator
Always censoring my every move

Barred reality, I'm living blindly

[Verse 3]

Song Description: In The Unforgiven, James speaks of how the society controlled him to do what it wants, thus doing to him what cannot be forgiven. In The Unforgiven II, a person in his life hurt him very badly, and became unforgiven to James.

Now in The Unforgiven III, he considers himself as unforgiven for going through the wrong path: following fame and wealth.

I think after The Unforgiven III, were kind of done with it. I think Im able to forgive, forgive myself and move on.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on

[Chorus]
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you

These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
His sinking life outside its hell

Slipping fast, down with his ship
Fading in the shadows

Title: Eye of the Beholder
Release Date: August 25, 1988, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-eye-of-the-beholder-lyrics
Song Description: Eye of the Beholder is about politicians, special interest groups, controlling your freedom of speech and expression.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Do you see what I see? Truth is an offense
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear? Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel? Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take? Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

[Chorus]
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

[Verse 2]
Do you fear what I fear? Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose? More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need? Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust? Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

Do you want what I want? Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom's ring

Title: To Live Is to Die
Release Date: August 25, 1988, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-to-live-is-to-die-lyrics
Song Description: This song is a tribute to Cliff Burton. The bass line is medley of unused recordings that Cliff performed prior to his death. Because the original recordings are not used on the track, the composition is credited as written by Burton and played by Newsted. The spoken word at the end of the song (When a man lies, he murders some part of the world. These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives.) was written by German poet Paul Gerhardt, but was erroneously attributed to Burton in the liner notes. The second half of the speech (All this I cannot bear to witness any longer. Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home?) was written by Burton.

This spoken word passage is one that the members of the band often recall Cliff saying  so much so that the last line is marked on his grave site. To Live is to Die is the last Metallica catalog piece accredited to Cliff Burton chronologically, as he was working on it prior to his death.

For years, this song was never performed live in its entirety. At best, only an excerpt from the melodic bridge was performed on guitars and bass during the tour following this album. This changed in 2011, when it was performed in full for the first time ever as part of the 30 Years of Metallica festival.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental (0:00 - 7:33)]

[Interlude]
When a man lies, he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives

Title: Turn the Page
Release Date: November 24, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-turn-the-page-lyrics
Song Description: A cover of the song originally by Bob Seger, about the difficulties of life on the road as a rock musician.

Lars Ulrich discovered the track when he was driving, and felt it fit the band perfectly.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engine's moanin' out his one-note song
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wanderin' the way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours, and there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through

[Chorus]
Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go, playin' star again
There I go, turn the page
[Verse 2]
So you walk into this restaurant, all strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can
All the same old clichés: "Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand
Make your stand

[Chorus]
Ah, here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage

You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said

Title: Disposable Heroes
Release Date: March 3, 1986, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-disposable-heroes-lyrics
Song Description: This song from Metallicas third album is an anti-war song. It is one of the most intense songs Metallica has ever written, with certain sections performed at 220 beats per minute.

The lyrics tell the story from the point of view of a soldier on the battlefield who receives orders from his general to keep fighting, no matter how many will die. The general believes his soldiers are merely expendable tools.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant 'til I fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son, but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death, he's yours to take away

[Chorus]
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die
Back to the front
You coward, you servant, you blind man

[Verse 2]

Title: The Day That Never Comes
Release Date: September 12, 2008, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-the-day-that-never-comes-lyrics
Song Description: The fourth song on Metallicas 2008 album, Death Magnetic, is accompanied by quite the music video. The song starts off clean and then builds up in tempo and heaviness, much like in Fade to Black, One, and Welcome Home (Sanitarium).

The lyrics can be interpreted in many different ways, but Lars Ulrich, the bands drummer, states that the song is about a Father-Son relationship.  Upon closer inspection, this relationship is abusive. This lead single strikes some rather extreme emotions of depression and aggression, along with sharing a line between how much can be taken and how much is enough.

The Day That Never Comes gives the listener just a taste of what to expect from this modern Metallica album. Something truly different than what you would expect from the past decade.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Born to push you 'round
Better just stay down
You pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the ground
Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed, keep praying, just keep waiting

[Chorus]
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes, ah
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comes

[Verse 2]
Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself, crawl in yourself, you'll have your time
God, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray

Title: Harvester of Sorrow
Release Date: August 25, 1988, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-harvester-of-sorrow-lyrics
Song Description: This song is about a man who suffers abuse during his childhood, something that has traumatised him throughout his adulthood. The aforementioned trauma descends him into madness and he decides to murder his family. The song focuses on the topic of domestic violence and abuse, and highlights the effects trauma can have on someone once they grow older. It is the slowest song on And Justice For All and one of the slowest songs Metallica has ever recorded.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
My life suffocates, planting the seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate, trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take this life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth, you've turned this lie to truth

Title: Atlas, Rise!
Release Date: November 18, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-atlas-rise-lyrics
Song Description: Metallica powers the feelings of carrying on, continuing with what you are doing and letting other people lift on your shoulders while seeing this as a punishment.

In Greek mythology, Atlas was a Titan sentenced to support the sky on his shoulders. Vocalist Hetfield is kicking back against the bitterness and burden of being in that position and claiming it is a punishment he deserves. The song has the dont let the world grind you down feeling; with a length of over 6 minutes of on-spot vocals, a killer riff and a great theme Metallica definitely conquers the heart of heroic-story lovers.

This also contains influences from the song Hallowed Be Thy Name by Iron Maiden.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Bitterness and burden
Curses thrust on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All eternity
Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the masses, blame rejection
Hold the pose, feign perception
Grudges break your back

All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on

Title: Don’t Tread on Me
Release Date: August 12, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-dont-tread-on-me-lyrics
Song Description: James Hetfield describes Dont Tread On Me as just one of those dont fuck with us songs. The track makes obvious references to the Gadsden Flag, which features a rattlesnake (also found on this albums cover) with the slogan Dont Tread On Me underneath it.



Several lyrics make direct references to a letter Benjamin Franklin wrote to the Pennsylvania Journal in 1775 addressing what would become the Gadsden Flag, like Shining with brightness, always on surveillance, eyes that never close, emblem of vigilance  and Never begins it, never, but once engaged never surrenders.

Its also worth noting that the guitar lead in the intro is the America melody from West Side Story. It can be heard here.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Don't tread on me
I said, don't tread on me

[Verse 1]
Liberty or death
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her
Rattling of her tail
Never begins it
Never, but once engaged
Never surrenders
Showing the fangs of rage
I said, don't tread on me

[Chorus]
So be it, threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it, settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore, hey
Don't tread on me

[Verse 2]
Love it or leave it
She with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue
Forked as a lightning strike
Shining with brightness

It consists of three main parts; a heavy beginning, the spacey bass-led interlude, and the ending recapitulation that brings back the heaviness. The song features four solos, two of which are bass solos by Cliff Burton.

Burton called this song his favorite, after Master of Puppets. Cliff utilized his bass in such a way that the 2 prominent bass solos in this song are commonly mistaken as having been produced by a guitar. The first solo begins at the 1:42 mark and continues on until 2:13. The second surfaces much later in the song right after the bass Interlude. It begins at 6:36 and continues until 6:55. The opening organ-like sounds were achieved by Cliff using a wah-wah pedal on his bass, and probably a Leslie Speaker along with delay effects.



Guitarist and vocalist James Hetfield has the notes for the bass part in the middle of the song tattooed on his left arm.



This song, along with Welcome Home (Sanitarium) and The Call Of Ktulu is featured in the movie
Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills.

Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
"Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore it's done"
"The brightest flame burns quickest"
Is what I heard her say
A son's heart's owned to Mother
But I must find my way

[Chorus]
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still (be still)

[Verse 2]
"Rebel," my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

[Verse 3]
Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
But a mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me, yeah-yeah
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see

Title: Damage, Inc.
Release Date: March 3, 1986, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-damage-inc-lyrics
Song Description: Damage, Inc. is the eighth and final song on the Master of Puppets album, released in 1986. It details the titular savage and vicious corporation that enslaves the population and lays waste to humanity.

The swelling bass intro to Damage, Inc. is based on a Johann Sebastian Bach piece, titled Come, Sweet Death. Cliff Burton studied Bach as a teenager.
Lyrics:

[Bass Intro]

[Verse 1]
Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard, and no one's going to give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

[Chorus]
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
(Damage Incorporated)

[Verse 2]
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood, and we make sure
Life isn't for you, and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use

Sight and smell of this, it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all, and fucking no regrets
Never happy endings on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc., you see
Step a little closer, if you please

Title: Moth Into Flame
Release Date: November 18, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-moth-into-flame-lyrics
Song Description: Moth into Flame Is the second single for Hardwired To Self-Destruct,  released on September 26th, 2016 on Howard Sterns show.

https://twitter.com/Metallica/status/780412765827633152

The songs main theme is fame and celebrity, inspired by the documentary Amy,  as James Hetfield said he was saddened watching how  Amy Winehouse went from such a lively joyous person, to someone who was just trying to escape the reality of where she was with drugs and misbehavior.

The song could be considered a discussion on the vices of fame on society, and how the celebrities are used and discarded by the media.
Lyrics:

Title: Hero of the Day
Release Date: June 4, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-hero-of-the-day-lyrics
Song Description: The sixth track from Metallicas 1996 album, Load. Fittingly, its aggressive yet delicate sound reflect its sensitive and wrath-inducing subject matter. Although laden with historical references, this song is ultimately about the human spirit, and the various ways in which we respond to adversity. It discourages us from becoming bitter as a result of the negative experiences weve had, and encourages us to be sympathetic and lend a helping hand to those who are not in a good spot right now. It became the albums second single. Like the previous single, Until It Sleeps, it became a #1 hit on the US Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks.

The lyrics are about war and the soldiers being sent to it, a topic Metallica is pretty familiar with (For Whom the Bell Tolls, One, Disposable Heroes).

Title: The Shortest Straw
Release Date: August 25, 1988, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-the-shortest-straw-lyrics
Song Description: Continuing the strong political theme of And Justice For All, The Shortest Straw is a scathing critique of the blacklisting of people with controversial political opinions. James Hetfield angrily tells the story of a man discriminated against in whats supposed to be a free society.

The song specifically references the red scare of the 1950s, when the U.S. government and private companies teamed up to single out politicians and activists they suspected of having communist sympathies. Many times, these anti-communist politicians  especially senator Joseph McCarthy  used the red scare to get rid of their political opponents.



Some Metallica lore claims that this song is a reference to the death of the bands original bassist, Cliff Burton. Some versions of his passing involve Kirk Hammett and Burton playing a game of chance (picking a card or a straw) out of a bundle to determine who would sleep where on the tour bus they were traveling on. Burton was forced to switch with Hammett, and his position on the bus resulted in his death when the vehicle tipped over. Therefore, Burton had the shortest straw pulled for him. This connection remains unconfirmed by the band. Burtons death does play a role in the album as a whole, especially in To Live Is To Die.

Title: Spit Out the Bone
Release Date: November 18, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-spit-out-the-bone-lyrics
Song Description: The closer of Hardwired to Self-Destruct, Metallicas tenth album, Spit Out the Bone is a thrash metal song about the need for technology and the transhumanist agenda. Frontman James Hetfield explained the song:

Spit Out the Bone" is getting rid of the human flesh part  machinery is so much more efficient. We want things quicker. We want the convenience of technology. [] But at what point is convenience leaning into dependency? We need it, or else we dont know what to do.

The band decided to give the fans a first glance of the album by releasing music videos for all the songs on the album every two hours on November 17, one day before Hardwired reached stores on the 18th. Being the album closer, Spit Out the Bone was the final reveal.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Come unto me and you will feel perfection
Come unto me and dedicate
Come unto me, you'll never feel rejection
Come unto me and terminate
Remove your heart, it's only good for bleeding
Bleeding through your fragile skin
Remove your thought 'cause it's only for deceiving
Deceiving thoughts destroy within

Disappear like man was never here

Plug into me, I guarantee devotion
Plug into me and dedicate
Plug into me and I'll save you from emotion

Title: The God That Failed
Release Date: August 12, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-the-god-that-failed-lyrics
Song Description: This entire song is about James Hetfields mother and her refusal of cancer treatment because of her Christian Science beliefs. The beliefs are that you should not be healed by doctors, nor take modern medication. So, when Hetfields mother developed cancer, the only help she was given was in the form of prayer. She ultimately died. His father had already left the family a few years prior to Hetfields' mothers death, leaving him now without either parent (though father came back years later, once James was already rich and famous).

When I was writing that song, I was in the throes of hatred around it, an upheaval of some unpleasant childhood stuff. I know what my higher power is all about, and I now know what my parents' idea of a higher power was all about. So Im able to leave their stuff with them and take my stuff where I need to claim it. Im able to move on with that. And the song is pretty damn heavy.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Pride you took, pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel
Not the word, not the love
Not what you thought from above

Song Description: This song was ReLoads first single, released on November 11, 1997. It was very successful, hitting #28 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song features singer Marianne Faithfull doing some additional vocals.

The lyrics, admittedly inspired by Sunset Blvd., are about a former star who goes insane once her 15 minutes of fame expire and she spends her entire life trying to reclaim that glory.

Title: The Call of Ktulu
Release Date: July 27, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-the-call-of-ktulu-lyrics
Song Description: Metallicas musical homage to H.P. Lovecrafts supernatural horror classic The Call of Cthulhu. The alternate spelling comes from the writings of August Derleth, one of many authors to borrow some of Lovecrafts creations. Lovecraft in turn borrowed theirs. The collaboration of the various authors served to lend an air of verisimilitude to their works. Collectively, these works are known as the Cthulhu mythos.



Metallica would return to the Cthulhu mythos with The Thing That Should Not Be on their next album.

Title: Inamorata
Release Date: April 14, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-inamorata-lyrics
Song Description: The 12th and final track of Metallicas 2023 72 Seasons album, Inamorata is a Metallica-style ballad with a labyrinth of riffs.

Clocking in at 11 minutes and 10 seconds, Inamorata is the longest song written by Metallica across their discography.

Inamorata comes from Latin and means a persons female lover which ties in with the main theme of the song. In the song, James sings about a long lost female lover who has broken him and damned him to eternal misery and emotional suffering. He laments at the loss of his partner and contemplates revenge for her betrayal, eventually realising that he doesnt need her anymore.

The song makes nods to the classic ballad Nothing Else Matters which deals with similar themes as well as My Friend Of Misery, incorporating some of its lyrics.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Welcome, won't you come inside?
Meet the ghosts where I reside
Despite how they're abusin' me
Lonely I will never be
Comfort in the hell I know
Resentment like a cancer grows
Longing for the day I'm free
Burn to get you out of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Lyin', supplyin' the need
Shedding and spreading the seed
Setting the trap with a thread
Spinnin' the web

Oh, oh, but I need her more
Misery, she loves me
Oh, oh, but I love her more

Title: My Friend of Misery
Release Date: August 12, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-my-friend-of-misery-lyrics
Song Description: My Friend of Misery is a track about an outsiders view of someone wandering in self-pity and having a very pessimistic view of the rest of the world.

This song was supposed to be the albums instrumental track to follow the tradition from previous albums. However, Hetfield later changed this after favoring vocals. He details this in a June 2012 interview with The Village Voice:

That song was originally an instrumental. I dont know how or why. I just started adding vocals to it and brought it to another level. That twin solo-y thing is pretty cool. Kirk and I are pulling that off pretty good. Those are the solos that Im able to contribute; some of those non-fast solosmore melodic with crazy harmoniesthats what I like doing.

Its worth noting that the song was first played live in 2012 with Metallicas European Black Album Tour where they revisited each track of the album.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You just stood there screaming
Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You, you're smothered in tragedy
And you're out to save the world

[Chorus]
Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders

There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery

[Verse 2]
You still stood there screaming
No one caring about these words you tell
My friend, before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You, you'll take it on all yourself

Title: The Frayed Ends of Sanity
Release Date: August 25, 1988, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-the-frayed-ends-of-sanity-lyrics
Song Description: This song is about a singer who is becoming increasingly paranoid and therefore on the brink of losing his mind.

The song is famous for the bands long-lasting refusal to ever play it live. The band would often troll the crowd by playing the intro and then changing to Seek and Destroy or another song. It remained the only song from the bands first five albums (their most popular) never played live in its entirety. Finally, after many petitions from the fans for it to be played live, it was played live in Helsinki on May 2014. Even then, it was part of the Metallica by Request tour, in which the fans could vote for the songs the band would have to play. The songs live debut can be witnessed here.

In the picture underneath, you can see the many votes for the song. Another fan-favorite song that was rarely played live is Dyers Eve from the same album, which came in second place.

Title: Escape
Release Date: July 27, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-escape-lyrics
Song Description: This song from the Metallicas second album was one that largely went unnoticed.

This is James Hetfields single most hated Metallica song, because the record company had forced them to write something more radio friendly. They refused to ever play it live, until 2012 at Orion Music Festival, when they were playing the album in its entirety.

Because the lyrical content is based around themes of personal-freedom, inner-strength and resiliency, the hardcore band Hatebreed chose to release a (detuned) cover of it as the album closer on their fifth (self-titled) album..
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity

[Chorus]
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own to live my own way

[Verse 2]
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so called standards

Title: Now That We’re Dead
Release Date: November 18, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-now-that-were-dead-lyrics
Song Description: This song is about a love that was meant to be, but couldnt continue because one of the lovers had died. This is in the point of view of the partner still living, who is on the verge of Death, and is ready to see their partner again.

When interviewed by So What!, James Hetfield gave his personal interpretation of the song.

[At] the end of the day were all the same. Having something to believe in, maybe theres an afterlife. Maybe it started out as wanting to be more of a modern-day Romeo and Juliet. Were in this together. Helping each other through life. And you know, now that were dead, I mean that could mean lots of things. Actually, you are dead. Youre onto the next life. Or youve gone through something horrible as a couple. Now youre [both] on the other side of it. So, trusting in another person. And at the end of the day, your behaviors, whatever youve done, theyre just behaviors. You can amend them, you can make up for them, and together, move on with a clean conscience. Theres [also] an exploration feel of, like, I dont know whats next  come on, lets try it. Lets go. Lets do it.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
When darkness falls, may it be
That we should see the light
When reaper calls, may it be
That we walk straight and right
When doubt returns, may it be
That faith shall permeate our scars
When we’re seduced, then may it be
That we not deviate our cause

Title: Hit the Lights

Song Description: Hit the Lights (as we know it) was written in 1982, and is the opening song on the album Kill Em All. In the early years Hit the Lights was the song to kick off most of their concerts.

James Hetfield had written most of the song in his previous band called Leather Charm. When Lars Ulrich and him formed Metallica, they rewrote the song to what we know it as today.

Hit the Lights is about the rush of playing metal, and how the love to see their fans go nuts.

This song was written by James Hetfield and composed by James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, and Kirk Hammett.

Title: Halo on Fire
Release Date: November 18, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-halo-on-fire-lyrics
Song Description: Halo On Fire is the longest song off Metallicas album Hardwired to Self-Destruct at a length of 8:15.

When interviewed by So What!, James Hetfield gave his personal interpretation of the song.

You can plug anything into that one really. Obviously Halo On Fire, theres a juxtaposition in all of us, good, evil, and when does that come out, when does it show itself? Some people portray themselves as real saints, [and] the more their darkness is, the more they have to portray themselves as saints. So youre basically getting away from the real you, like youre making up for all of this [stuff] that you think is really bad.

The last two minutes or so of the song consists of a breakdown section that effectively separates the song into two distinct parts, with the latter part essentially being the climax of the song.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Obey, obey
Come won't you stay
Sincere, sincere
All ends in tears
Endure, endure
Thoughts most impure
Concede, concede
But both shall we bleed

[Chorus]
Oh, Halo on fire

Title: Trapped Under Ice
Release Date: July 27, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-trapped-under-ice-lyrics
Song Description: Trapped Under Ice is the fifth song on Metallicas second album Ride the Lightning, released in 1984. Its lyrics tell the tale of someone who was cryogenically frozen and woke up from his sleep, only to find that he is unable to escape from his chamber. The idea of somebody being unable to move yet having a perfectly functional mind was revisited in One from 1988s And Justice For All.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore

[Chorus]
Freezing (Freezing), can't move at all
Screaming (Screaming), can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, I'm trapped under ice

[Verse 2]
Crystallized as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep, I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say

[Chorus]
Freezing (Freezing), can't move at all
Screaming (Screaming), can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, I'm trapped under ice

[Bridge]
(Scream) From my soul

Title: Screaming Suicide
Release Date: January 19, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-screaming-suicide-lyrics
Song Description: Screaming Suicide is the third track from Metallicas upcoming 11th studio album 72 Seasons which will be released on April 14th, 2023. The song talks about suicide, specifically it being a taboo word and how the topic is frowned upon. The lyrics come from the personified suicide/temptation, similar to other Metallica songs (eg: Sad but True, Master of Puppets)
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Welcome to this life
Born into the fight
Here to claim your dream
Look you in the eye
Patch the broken sky
Craving dopamine
Then my voice appears
Teaching you of fears
Are you good enough?
You don't recognize
Head is full of lies
You should just give up

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well

[Chorus]
Don't ever speak my name
Remеmber you're to blame
Keep mе inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide

[Verse 2]
Curse another day
Spirit locked away
Punish and deprive
Hate to be awake
Living a mistake
More dead than alive
Then a voice appears
Whisper in your ears
"You are good enough"
Throwing down a rope
A lifeline of hope
Never give you up

Keeps drinking cyanide
And no more can you run

[Chorus]
And now you speak my name
You've given back the blame
Keep me deep inside
Don't you keep me inside

[Outro]
Now that I'm exposed inside
Shined a light on cyanide
I'm no longer needed here
Now you've faced your biggest fear

Title: Bleeding Me
Release Date: June 4, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-bleeding-me-lyrics
Song Description: This song is a song from Metallicas 6th album, Load, and was a promotional single for radio stations in the late 90s.

Its lyricist, singer-guitarist James Hetfield, sums up its meaning in a 2001 interview with Playboy:

Around the time of Load, I felt I wanted to stop drinking. Maybe Im missing out on something. Everyone else seems so happy all the time. I want to get happy. Id plan my life around a hangover: The Misfits are playing in town Friday night, so Saturday is hangover day. I lost a lot of days in my life. Going to therapy for a year, I learned a lot about myself. Theres a lot of things that scar you when youre growing up, you dont know why. The song Bleeding Me is about that: I was trying to bleed out all bad, get the evil out. While I was going through therapy, I discovered some ugly stuff in there. A dark spot.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'm digging my way
I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to something better

Title: The Outlaw Torn
Release Date: June 4, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-the-outlaw-torn-lyrics
Song Description: James said that this song is about losing someone to death and longing to find a replacement that never comes. It could be written about the bands late bassist, Cliff Burton, who died in a tour bus accident back in the 80s.

At 9:48, it is the longest song in the album and one of the longest songs Metallica has ever made.

Two versions of the song exist. One is the regular album cut that made it in the album, the other is the Unencumbered by Manufacturing Restrictions version, which is the full version without the fade out that couldnt fit in the album due to CD restrictions. This version was released as a single.:

When we were doing the final sequencing of the LOAD album, the record company told us that we couldnt go a second past 78:59, or your CDs wouldnt play without potentially skipping. With our 14 songs, we were running about 30 seconds over, and something had to give, so the cool-ass jam at the end of Outlaw got chopped.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro 00:00-01:20]

[Verse 1]
And now I wait my whole lifetime for you
And now I wait my whole lifetime for you
I ride the dirt, I ride the tide for you
I search the outside, search inside for you
To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so I may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm outlaw torn
I'm outlaw torn
And I'm torn

[Verse 2]
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you
The more I search, the more my need for you
The more I bless, the more I bleed for you
You make me smash the clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel

Title: All Nightmare Long
Release Date: September 12, 2008, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-all-nightmare-long-lyrics
Song Description: All Nightmare Long was released as Metallicas fifth single from Death Magnetic. The single was released on December 15, 2008.

It was nominated for the Kerrang! Award for Best Single.

The music video, directed by Roboshobo, which does not feature the band, is an alternate history narrative done in a grainy mockumentary style, depicting a sequence of fictional events following the historic 1908 Tunguska event, at which Soviet scientists discover spores of an extraterrestrial organism, a small harmless thing resembling an armored worm. However, it turns out the incredibly hardy spores are able to reanimate dead tissue, and subjects turn violent sometime after exposure to the spores; the USSR adapts them as a bioweapon and scatters them from balloons in a preemptive strike against the U.S., causing a localized zombie apocalypse before intervening militarily to distribute humanitarian aid. At the end of the video, a hybrid U.S.-USSR flag is raised in the now-Soviet-ruled America, and a headless corpse is shown breaching containment and escaping from a Soviet biowarfare lab.

Title: So What?
Release Date: October 28, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-so-what-lyrics
Song Description: Metallicas cover of an Anti-Nowhere League song that is possibly one of the most obscene songs Metallica has ever released.

So What was released as a B-side to the Sad But True single, and in some cases was even released as a secret track on their self-titled album, also known as The Black Album. The song was eventually put onto Garage Inc. seeing as how the album serves as a compilation of Metallicas B-side covers.

The cover is also not without sin, as on November 16th, 1996, Metallica decided to mess with the MTV Europe Music Awards broadcast of that year. Instead of performing King Nothing as they were told to do, the band performed Last Caress, a cover of The Misfits, and So What. Since the performance of the two covers were completely random and aired uncut, this led to controversy. This costed the performance to be totally cut out of future airings.

Original Metallica bassist Ron McGovney once said that he hated this song and thought it was the most disgusting song that Metallica ever recorded.

Title: Ain’t My Bitch
Release Date: June 4, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-aint-my-bitch-lyrics
Song Description: One of the more noticeable changes in Metallicas sound, this song features rather heavy riffs, which some consider hard rock. The songs working title was originally just Bitch when it was originally being recorded.

The song itself is about a problem that the speaker does not care about, such as a person or situation and the speaker expresses this apathy by saying it isnt their bitch, which could be compared to a lover posing as a problem.

The bitch in the song doesnt refer to an actual woman and is more metaphorical for a problem in the way of the narrator. Another way to express the songs title could be Aint My Gripe.
Lyrics:

Title: No Remorse
Release Date: July 25, 1983, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-no-remorse-lyrics
Song Description: Another thrash metal hit and fan favorite off of Kill Em All. No Remorse is about a soldier being sent to war to kill people. The soldiers depicted in the song are supposed to kill without question, without remorse.

This song combines two riffs from some of the very first songs the band ever wrote, including Handsome Ransom and Lets Go Rock'n'Roll.

No Remorse served as the base for a classic theme in the 1993 game Doom. It is widely accepted as the inspiration for the track and fueled both Doom and Metallicas popularity.
Lyrics:

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
No mercy for what we're doing
No thought to even what we've done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

Title: Frantic
Release Date: June 5, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-frantic-lyrics
Song Description: The opening track to Metallicas 2003 album St. Anger, and the second single from the album. Frantic, like many songs in the album, is about the band members' struggles with past addictions, particularly James Hetfields alcoholism, for which he spent many months on rehab.

This is the only song from the album that is represented as a playable track in the 2009 rhythm game Guitar Hero: Metallica.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
If I could have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?

Or look ahead, but keep on turning?

Could I have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?

Title: Holier Than Thou
Release Date: August 12, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-holier-than-thou-lyrics
Song Description: Although described by James Hetfield as one of the sillier songs by the band, Holier Than Thou deals with the issue of a self-righteous person, paraphrasing Jesus in the book of Matthew:

Judge not, that ye be not judged.
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?
Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye.
- Matthew 7:1,4-5



FUN FACT: Bob Rock initially suggested that this song should be the first single from Metallica. Thats probably about all you need to know about him!


The band still teases me about this song because it was the first track that jumped out at me as a potential single. I should point out that at this stage in cutting the record there were no lyrics, so initially, something about the song spoke to me. It rocked in a very aggressive way that said Metallica to me.

As we got deeper into the record, the tide turned and other songs blossomed and became bigger and turned into things like Enter Sandman, whereas Holier Than Though great song, not a single. I still like its energy and tempo. Its got such a lethal bite to it. Every time I see the band, they always say the same thing: Holier Than Thou, huh? Theyll never let me live it down. What can I say?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
No more, the crap rolls out your mouth again
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead?
Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much, you believe yourself
Judge not, lest ye be judged yourself

[Chorus]
Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou

[Verse 2]
Before you judge me, take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do?
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand
It's not who you are, it's who you know
Others' lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and build them back with wealth

Song Description: A reflection upon the universe and how mankind has taken its place in it, along with its never ending appetite when it comes to thinking about the unknown and seeking knowledge and information.

Years later, it would baptize the 2013 concert movie Metallica: Through the Never.
Lyrics:

Title: Jump in the Fire
Release Date: July 25, 1983, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-jump-in-the-fire-lyrics
Song Description: Jump in the Fire is a song by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released as the second and final single from their debut album, Kill Em All. The single was accompanied by fake live performances of Phantom Lord and Seek & Destroy which were alternate studio recordings with sounds of a crowd overdubbed in.

Alongside Hit the Lights and No Remorse, Jump in the Fire is one of Metallicas first original songs, having been included on Ron McGovneys 82 Garage demo, an unreleased recording. The original lyrics and content, which dealt with sex, were written by Dave Mustaine in his former band Panic at the age of 16. The original version that Mustaine introduced to Hetfield and Ulrich upon joining Metallica was raw. The three worked together on refining the song and the final outcome is what is heard on the demo. However, much like the events surrounding The Four Horsemen, new lyrics were written by James Hetfield upon Mustaines departure from Metallica. The new lyrics revolve around people being damned to Hell and therefore jumping in the fire. Lars Ulrich claims that they had written the song to sound like Run to the Hills by Iron Maiden, which was popular at the time. Current live performances since 2004 are in D standard tuning, as opposed to the E standard tuning of earlier live performances.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the Earth
To join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it's time for your fate and I won't hesitate
To pull you down into this pit

[Chorus]
So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

[Verse 2]
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
And from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now, my child, not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say

[Verse 3]
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I'm stalking you as prey
Living your life with me, I am you, you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand, walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

[Chorus]
So come on

Song Description: Its about your darkness/shadows following you everywhere you go and refusing to leave you, and learning that this is okay,  and learning to live with it.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Hanging by a thread as I play dead
Hanging by a thread and my mind is code red
Cut and run, try to hide, get away, shut my eyes, just to hide from the fate
Cut and run, try to hide, get away, cover up, get shelter from the hate
Demonized, liquified, tranquilized, prophesied, just to hide from life
Night and day, led astray, in decay, come what may, not to face that fight

[Chorus]
Seethin'
Breathin'
Nightmares grow
On I run
Still my shadows follow

[Verse 2]
Never can I stop 'cause they hunt me
Never can I stop 'cause the beast is hungry
Like a wolf on the hunt stalking prey
Closing in, no, it won't let me be
Like a wolf on the hunt stalks a prey
Any cost, fulfill a destiny

Title: Low Man’s Lyric
Release Date: November 18, 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-low-mans-lyric-lyrics
Song Description: Low Mans Lyric is the eleventh song from 1997s album ReLoad. It was written by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, with a length of 7:37.

An unplugged live version of it, recorded on April 11, 1998, in Perth (Australia), was released in Six Feet Down Under EP. The song features an instrument called the hurdy-gurdy in some performances.

This song is not of typical Metallica thrash metal style. Its more like some of their metal ballads like Nothing Else Matters, Tuesdays Gone (a Lynyrd Skynyrd cover) and Turn the Page (which was a Bob Seger cover). It also has some similarities in sound to the hair band ballads from the late 1980s.

It describes the thoughts of a homeless man who is suffering through his life, wanting to get another chance. Hence, maybe youll understand, and wont cry for this man, cause low man is due and please forgive me.

This song has been played live 65 times. The first was on October 18, 1997, in Mountain View, CA. The band hasnt played this song since September 13, 1998, in San Diego, CA.

But I lie, lie straight to the mirror
The one I've broken to match my face

And I can't bear to see

Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sins

[Pre-Chorus]
So you lay us in a line
Push your pins, they make us humble
Only you can tell in time
If we fall or merely stumble

[Chorus]
But tell me, can you heal what Father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?
Tell me, can you heal what Father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain-free
You jab another pin, jab another pin in me

Or fix this hole in a mother's son?

[Bridge]
Blood for face, sweat for dirt
Three Xs for the stone
To break this curse, a ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone
Shell of shotgun, pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith which way we can
To fall in love with life again
[Pre-Chorus]
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love, to fall in love
To fall in love with life again

[Chorus]
So tell me, can you heal what Father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?

Or cut this rope and let us run?

Lyrics:

[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
Like a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face that learned to speak, when all it knew was how to bite
Like a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like conviction, a premonition not worthy of, so I deny, I deny

[Pre-Chorus]
I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Almost like your life, almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long, realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow, never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight, and there it went almost like your life

[Verse 2]
Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river, drowning when I only need a drink
Like a poison that I swallow, but I want the world to die
Like a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave from way back then
Like a general without a mission until the war would start again
Start again

Title: You Must Burn!
Release Date: April 14, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-you-must-burn-lyrics
Song Description: The 5th track of Metallicas 2023 72 Seasons album, You Must Burn! is a take on Metallicas heavy, chuggy sound.

You Must Burn! takes the light/dark theme of the album to the extreme. The song is a take on duplicity, falsehood and justice, where the protagonist burns away his true self in favour of a malicious, prying facade.

The song is a continuation of the themes present in the song Sad But True from Metallicas 1991 Black Album and features a similar style to the song.

You Must Burn! is one of the two songs to feature an exclamation point in its official title (the other being Atlas, Rise! from 2016s Hardwired To Self-Destruct).
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
Catch a fire and burn all the misery
Foul fingers spin mob mentality
Anger on the rise as the flames grow higher
Choke on the smoke of the funeral pyre
Backfire

[Pre-Chorus: James Hetfield]
Killing all we've learned
History will burn
Burn it

[Chorus]
Smile as it burns to the ground

Question yourself, you may learn
Who's the next witch you must burn?
You must burn!

Title: All Within My Hands
Release Date: June 5, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-all-within-my-hands-lyrics
Song Description: All Within My Hands is the final track on Metallicas St. Anger. The song is one of the heaviest off the experimental album, but not so much with the alternate performance, which was performed live with an acoustic turn, resembling what the song may have turned out to be had the drama surrounding Metallica at the time simply not existed.

This song goes on the topic of controlling the ones you love, including family and friends. The message of the song is put into metaphors of killing and choking those who are being controlled and manipulated. It is also mentioned that theres a reliability on control, as a need in order to survive.

Strangely, this songs title was recycled for the AWMH Foundation, which is a charity foundation based around the Metallica theme.

Title: Here Comes Revenge
Release Date: November 18, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-here-comes-revenge-lyrics
Song Description: A throwback to Black Album, Load, Reload, and even Master of Puppets-esque writing styles, this song focuses on the idea of Wrath, and the thrill of finally getting revenge for what has been done to you by others.

When interviewed by So What!, James Hetfield gave his personal interpretation of the song.

Yeah. Theres Morgan Harrington. Just tons of stuff about families that have someone taken from them. Theres a friend of mine whose son died, and I wont name names, theres a couple that has followed us on tour for a long time that has been very instrumental in that song and inspirational to me. Their daughter was killed by a drunk driver. And she loved Metallica, and the way this family is staying connected with her is coming to the Metallica shows and enjoying what she enjoyed, and maybe connecting that way. I find that pretty amazing. And very strong. Its such a vulnerable thing to have happen to you. I mean [it] destroys your life; [you] just sit there and think about it all the time, ruminate on it over and over. What could I have done to change things? What if, what if? And how could you not be pissed? How could you not be angry at the person who took your childs life? That is real strength, to me. Because Im just writing in my perspective what I would do. You know, I would pray for revenge to happen and think thats the answer, when at the end of the day I know its not.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Little grave I'm grieving, I will mend you
Sweet revenge I'm dreaming, I will end you
I've been here since dawn of time
Countless hatreds built my shrine
I was born in anger's flame
He was Abel, I was Cain
I am here, I'm hell unbound
Burn your kingdom to the ground
To the ground

[Chorus]
Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, it's killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you, revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge

[Verse 2]
I return this nightmare, I will find you
Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I'm behind you
Man has made me oh so strong
Blurring lines of right and wrong
Far too late for frail amends
Now it's come to sweet revenge

Title: Phantom Lord
Release Date: July 25, 1983, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-phantom-lord-lyrics
Song Description: Despite being known as one of the bands most underrated songs, Phantom Lord is a driving thrash classic from Metallicas debut album, Kill Em All. The Phantom Lord mentioned throughout the song took its name from lead singer and frontman James Hetfields first band.

The song is a highly extended metaphor for Metallicas brand of thrash metal, sharing the same theme with songs like Hit the Lights and Whiplash, all songs that talk about the action involved with Metallicas thrash roots.

Originally seen on the No Life Til Leather demo tape recorded by Metallica with former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine now with the band Megadeth, Mustaine was accused of ripping off some of the riffs in this song on This Was My Life.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Bodies waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

[Chorus]
Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall on to your knees for the phantom lord

[Verse 2]
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

[Chorus]
Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall on to your knees for the phantom lord

Smoke is lifting from the ground

[Chorus]

Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall on to your knees for the phantom lord

Song Description: The 11th track of Metallicas 2023 72 Seasons album, Room of Mirrors is one of the two Metallica style thrash songs of the album.

It appears as the penultimate track of the album, following Metallicas tradition of closing albums with thrash songs (e.g My Apocalypse from 2008s Death Magnetic, Spit Out The Bone from 2016s Hardwired To Self-Destruct)

The song focuses on judgement, self-reflection and ones ego. It depicts a persona whos afraid to be themselves out of fear of judgement and their self-reflection.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
In a mirrored room, all alone I stand
Strip away the phantom fame
Exposing all sides to see
The good and bad in me
In a mirrored room, all alone I stand
Seeing past the flesh and bone
The shame and the fear I hide
Could I show you what's inside?

[Chorus]
Would you criticize, scrutinize, stigmatize my pain?
Would you summarize, patronize, classify insane?
So I stand here before you
You might judge, you might just bury me
Or you might set me free

[Verse 2]
In a mirrored room, talking to myself
And the voices pushing back
I'll let them inside my heart
But they'll tear it all apart
In a mirrored room, just a simple man
Naked, broken, beat, and scarred
What do I really know?
That fear of letting go

[Chorus]

Title: (Anesthesia)—Pulling Teeth
Release Date: July 25, 1983, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-anesthesiapulling-teeth-lyrics
Song Description: The fifth track on Metallicas 1983 debut album Kill Em All. Composed by then-bassist Cliff Burton, (Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth is the first official instrumental that Metallica has ever made. It consists primarily of a bass solo by Burton that goes through many twists and turns, until the second half where the drums of Lars Ulrich come in to back the rest of the bass solo.

It is considered one of the best bass solos in metal and solidifies Cliff Burton as a talented musician that was taken long before he was due.

Song Description: The 4th track of Metallicas 2023 72 Seasons album, Sleepwalk My Life Away is another bluesy-inspired mid-tempo song borrowing from its Load predecessor.

The song is about the monotony of the protagonists daily life. Every day, they wake up and follow the same routine. It is so monotonous that they could do it in their sleep, which is what the protagonist dreams about.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Take a deep, waking breath
Hope the blood arrives
Burn my eyes with the sun
And pretend I'm alive
It never will appear
Strong as past desire
Light warming disappears
Like a cold, dead fire

[Pre-Chorus]
Should I fall, I fall down
Would you come, you come 'round?

Caught in the spell I'm dreaming

Wake me

Song Description: The 7th track of Metallicas 2023 72 Seasons album, Crown of Barbed Wire features a bluesy riff mixed with the familiar heavy Metallica feel.

In similar style to their song King Nothing on their 1996 Load album, the song  speaks of a despotic, power hungry monarch whos obsession for the crown leads to the downfall (rusting) of them and their empire.

The main riff of this song traces back to a jam in the Montreal tuning room 6 years ago.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
So tight, this crown of barbed wire
It's destiny I wear
It splits the skin to the soul
This jagged wreath I bear

Bleed as I rust on this throne
Pierce me with torment
And all the rust that I own

[Chorus]
So tight, this crown of barbed wire

Drips down to bloodshot eyes
It crushes down what is real

Title: Wasting My Hate

The inspiration behind, Wasting My Hate:

Wasting My Hate was inspired by Country outlaw Waylon Jennings, a good friend of James Hetfield.  Waylon tells James the story of when he was sitting in a diner somewhere and there was a guy outside in a car staring at him. So Waylon annoyed stares back at the man angrily. When Waylon finally had enough he went out to talk to the guy in the car, only to find out that the man was sleeping. So he thought Oh man Ive wasted my hate on this guy.  James liked the line so much that he used it for writing a song about it.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Good day, how do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you

[Verse 1]

Song Description: The 10th track of Metallicas 2023 72 Seasons album, Too Far Gone? is a testament to Metallicas groovy metal scene.

Too Far Gone? is one of two Metallica songs to feature a question mark in its official title (the other being Am I Savage? from 2016s Hardwired To Self-Destruct).

The song looks at the ramifications of isolation. The protagonist has isolated themselves from the world and is now in desperation to escape their prison. They believe they have went too far in their isolation and now feel agitated.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I, I am desperation
Need it so bad today

Title: Am I Savage?
Release Date: November 18, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-am-i-savage-lyrics
Song Description: A more blues-inspired song, while still retaining the heavy Metallica feel, this song goes back to the lycanthropia seen in Of Wolf and Man, only this time its about the werewolf passing the curse on to his children.

When interviewed by So What!, James Hetfield gave his personal interpretation of the song.

Theres this line in there about inheritance. That was such a strong, strong word for me on this album. I was thinking that could be the title of the record, you know, Inheritance. Good or bad, youve inherited something. Whether its in your genes, in your blood, in your bank account, in your looks, whatever. You inherit things. And having a teenage boy is difficult for a dad at times. Youre proud of your boy but I tell you, the girls are a different story. The girls and the mom have an issue. The boys and the dad have issue, because theyre gonna grow up to be you and they dont want to be you. They want to be something else. [] My good intention here is to teach you something, and then when you dont want it, I get angry! Its more about me. So from my dad using anger as a big tool in the house to be heard, same with me. That was my inheritance and I started to pass it down to my boy, and I stopped. Its pretty huge.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Ooh, run away, the past will bite again
Ooh, no matter where you dwell
You, here again, a captive of the howl
You, welcome back to hell

[Refrain]
Faithful, as the full moon is rising

Title: I Disappear
Release Date: May 9, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-i-disappear-lyrics
Song Description: Formally releasing on May 9th, 2000 (and later on June 2nd as a single), I Disappear was a single by Metallica written for the Mission: Impossible 2 soundtrack, the last song by them to feature bassist Jason Newsted.

Though the song ended up being a commercial success in its own right, itll likely live on forever in infamy as the song that killed Napster, as a demo of the song would make the rounds on both the Internet and the radio, leading to Metallica taking action against the company, eventually settling on July 12, 2001 and leading to Napsters bankruptcy the next year.

There's no light
[Verse 1]
Ooh, down and out as darkness falls
So much more than he can take
Oh, shakes the cage in deep withdrawals
Come on, give the boy a break

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, he will break
He's no mistake

[Chorus]
Chase that light, lean on me!
Face that fight, lean on me!
Catch your fall, lean on me!
End it all, lean on me!
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light
[Verse 2]
Ooh, lost his way through wicked streets
But he is someone's little boy
Oh, all the love a young one needs
Thoughtless еlders have destroyеd

It is destroyed
He's just a boy

[Chorus]
Chase that light, lean on me!
Face that fight, lean on me!
Catch your fall, lean on me!
End it all, lean on me!
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light

[Bridge]
One step down
Block it all from view
One step down
With apathy, look straight through
One step down
Turn so you won't see
One step down
He's just like you and me

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Chase that light, lean on me!
Face that fight, lean on me!
Catch your fall, lean on me!
End it all, lean on me!
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light
[Outro]
There's no lightEmbed

Title: Loverman
Release Date: November 24, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Metallica-loverman-lyrics
Song Description: The most unexpected version in Garage Inc.  along with plenty of 70s\80s heavy metal and punk, here comes Australian Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds, with a song barely 4 years old. James Hetfield met the band through producer Bob Rock, who passed him a copy of Murder Ballads  I went Whoah! These are cool songs and theyre all about murders. But that made me investigate his other material and I was turned on by it completely, by the moods he created.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
There's a devil waitin' outside your door (How much longer?)
There's a devil waitin' outside your door (How much longer?)
And he's buckin' and brayin' and pawin' at the floor (How much longer?)
And he's howlin' with pain and crawlin' up the walls (How much longer?)
There's a devil waitin' outside your door (How much longer?)
And he's weak with evil and broken by the world (How much longer?)
And he's shoutin' your name and askin' for more (How much longer?)
There's a devil waitin' outside your door (How much longer?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Loverman! Since the world began
Forever, amen, till the end of time
Yeah, take off that dress
Ooh, I'm comin' down, yeah
I'm your loverman, yeah
‘Cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am

[Chorus]
L is for LOVE, baby
O is for ONLY you that I do
V is for loving VIRTUALLY everything that you are

[Verse 2]
There's a devil crawlin' along your floor (How much longer?)
There's a devil crawlin' along your floor (How much longer?)
With a tremblin' heart, he's comin' through your door (How much longer?)
With his strainin' sex in his jumpin' paw (How much longer?)
Ooh, there's a devil crawlin' along your floor (How much longer?)
And he's old, and he's stupid, and he's hungry, and he's sore
And he's blind, and he's lame, and he's dirty, and he's poor
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more, gimme more, gimme more (How much longer?)
There's a devil crawlin' along your floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Loverman! Haha! And here I stand
Forever, amen
‘Cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am

Seize that crown, yeah
Because I am what I am, what I am, what I am, plus I am
I'm your loverman

[Verse 3]
There's a devil layin' by your side (How much longer?)
There's a devil layin' by your side (How much longer?)
You might think he's asleep, but take a look at his eyes (How much longer?)
And he wants you, darlin', to be his bride (How much longer?)
Yeah, there's a devil layin' by your side (How much longer?)
[Outro]
