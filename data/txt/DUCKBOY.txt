Lyrics:

[Intro: Voicemail]
Oh yeah, it's DuckBoy!

[Verse 1]
Your pearl white eyes, they stain my moon red
Let's pull back the tide and see if the moon is dead
It sinks in, it sinks in
This bullet's silver kills
I'm thinkin', I'm linked in
To what gives you a thrill
Lights out
I'll take my noose off and howl at the sight of your hand in my claws
Your hand in my claws

[Chorus]
Fangs out, back hunched
I have all night to hunt
I have all night to hunt
I have all night to hunt
Fangs out, back hunched
I have all night to hunt
I have all night to hunt
I have all night to hunt
Night to hunt
All night!

One bullet left, heart beats in my chest
Why are you frightened?

[Chorus]
Fangs out, back hunched
I have all night to hunt
I have all night to hunt
I havе all night to hunt
Fangs out, back hunched
I have all night to hunt
I have all night to hunt
I havе all night to hunt

[Bridge]
I promise to protect you
I promise to protect you with my curse
I promise to protect you
I promise to protect you with my curse
I promise to protect you

[Chorus]
Fangs out, back hunched
I have all night to hunt
I have all night to hunt
I have all night to hunt
Fangs out, back hunched
I have all night to hunt

Title: XXL hadron collider
Release Date: July 14, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Duckboy-xxl-hadron-collider-lyrics
Song Description: Duckboy is heartbroken
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Let me sleep for eternity
Pull the blanket right over my head
Come join me, I'm lonely
Close your eyes, real slowly
This won't be something to dread
I promise

[Chorus]
I've been stabbed in the back
I smell blood on the track
I've been stabbed in the back
And I ain't crying over spilt milk but who's gonna clean this mess?
Take me out

[Verse 1]
Dig me up and out the ground
And wipe off all of the fucking dirt
You still won't get the message
I'll include the wreckage
I'm just trying to make this work
I promise

[Chorus]
I've been stabbed in the back
I smell blood on the track
I've been stabbed in the back (Stabbed in the back)

Who's gonna clean this mess?

[Verse 2]
I got a gun in my mouth
And all I can think about is how loud it would sound if I let off a round
But I'm dead on the ground
And the ground's stained brown, oh wow
I've been dead for a while now
How? I guess I'm a ghost now that I'm toast
But I wasn't burned alive
And I ain't crying over spilt milk but who's gonna clean this mess?

[Chorus]
I've been stabbed in the back
I smell blood on the track
I've been stabbed in the back
And I ain't crying over spilt milk but who's gonna clean this mess?
I guess a permanent stain of brain
Matches the drapes

[Outro: Voicemail]
Answer the phone you fucking pussy
That's all you ever were, bitch1Embed

Title: ​after further reasoning, i’m going to bed
Release Date: July 14, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Duckboy-after-further-reasoning-im-going-to-bed-lyrics
Song Description: Probably the best were going to get for an EP on broken krystal ball.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You can sleep in my grave
I won't be needing it
And you need some rest
It's the end of our days
I've tried melting the ice of your skin
I've done my best
Not even the sun can fix this one
Let me float down, let me float down, let me float down
Can I at least keep your skull?
If I look at you now, I'll turn to stone and guard your tomb
I'll live as long as my little lungs last
Haunting the depths of the flooded earth

[Verse 2]
And one day when it is my turn
I'll be too nervous to ask you to share and my spine might break
But I will get all that I yearned
My plan is to hug an anvil and sink to the bottom of a lake
I'll live as long as my little lungs last
Haunting the depths of the flooded earth
Will be my skull found in water bound grass
Will you bring flowers to my grave?
Let them float down
My grave
Let them float down
My grave
Let them float down
My grave

Will you let them float down to where I lay?Embed

I remember the way your lipstick
The way your lipstick bled that bloody red

Song Description: Fourth song of the album
Lyrics:

Can i am
I am in tin
I cannot sin
I only end and begin
I consist of atoms and even if you think theres a tad more to your origin
Youre still not fucking original

Open up your mind you fucking cyclops take a sip
Instead of chugging down the shit because you think it tastes good
We arent wasteful, we are full of waste
Rip open my ribs
You will see a piece of meat
Grab a plate
I don’t matter
I am matter
Can i am
I am in tin
I cannot sin
I only end and begin
I don’t matter
I am matter
Sold my soul to satan waiting in line at the mall
I got 6 phones 6 homes and a grave 6 feet tall
What do i know?
I failed chemistry
I hated religion

Give me a call when you get this
Number one, I wanna see how you doing and everything
I know last time we talked, uh, you know
It's been kind of sideways and shit like that, uh
You know I, I think you misinterpreted some of the things I said
And that's fine, that's okay
I can completely understand that coming from a text message
Uh, you know, I hope you don't take this time
As like, me not liking you or anything like that
I love you; you're my cousin
Uh, it's more so processing everything, bro
Tryna figure out how to go forward with this shit, man
And to be honest, I think the way we go forward this man is—
All this shit is bullshit, man we just push forward ahead, bro
That's it, I'm just calling to check on you and see how you're doingYou might also likeEmbed

Title: Pearls Are Just Oyster Puke

Song Description: DUCKBOYs feelings of rejection, his longing for validation, and the enduring wait for things to get better.
Lyrics:

Inspected then rejected
When will i feel im special?
Subjected to objective views
Let it get the best of you
The best of you is second guessed
I guess you never knew and you will never know
I was told i it would
I was told it would all be okay if i just wait
Im still waiting

The way you fucking treat me is worse than a rabid dog
I can't take it anymore

I was told i it would
I was told it would all be okay if i just wait
Im still waiting

And even if the clock just stopped
Maybe i just forgot
I dont know
Im still waitingYou might also likeEmbed
