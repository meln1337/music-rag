Artist: Bring Me The Horizon, Alternate Names: BMTH
Artist Description: Bring Me The Horizon are a British alternative rock band from Sheffield, Yorkshire—often stylised as simply “BMTH” or shortened to “Bring Me.” Formed in 2003, the group currently consists of lead vocalist Oliver “Oli” Sykes, lead guitarist Lee Malia, bassist Matt Kean, and drummer Matt Nicholls.





The name of the band was taken from Captain Jack Sparrow’s line in the first Pirates of the Caribbean which he says: “Bring me that horizon.” Oli stated in an interview with Spin how the name connects with his vision of the band:

Right at the end of the film—it might even be the very last line—Johnny Depp says, “Bring me that horizon.” That was really inspiring. I was still living with my parents in Sheffield, England, when the movie came out [in 2003]. For me and the band, playing music was always wrapped up with the idea of touring and traveling and seeing the rest of England and the rest of the world. We never thought doing that was possible, but that’s what we wanted to do. So that quote sort of stands in for our feeling of wanting to see what the planet had to offer.





BMTH’s sound has changed dramatically over the years. In their original incarnation, they were known for fast blast beats and deathcore influences. With the official addition of Jordan Fish on 2013’s Sempiternal, the group has steered towards a more stadium-friendly alternative rock sound. This was a conscious decision for the band to embrace melody and reach a wider audience.

Oli explained the shift as due to maturing in age and shifting interests, as well as a desire to take the band further than ever before:

We were just a metal band at one point. We were doing alright and playing some shows and now… now we’re one of the biggest heavy rock bands in the world. We want more now. It’s no longer just a fantasy; people know who we are. This can go as far as we want it to go. The only limit is us.

Two years after Sempiternal, That’s The Spirit was released with even more approach to alternative rock, becoming the band’s best selling album to date, with hits like “Drown,” “Happy Song,” “Throne” and “Follow You.”

On January 25th, 2019, their sixth studio album amo was released. The record is very experimental and mixes pop and electronic elements, inspired also by trap music on “why you gotta kick me when i’m down.”

During 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Bring Me started teasing videos of music prodution. At October 30, POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR was released as a callback to the band’s old style. It features four singles, “Ludens,” “Parasite Eve,” “Obey” and “Teardrops.”

After the release of the previous album, the band started to work on its successor, POST HUMAN: NeX GEn. Promoted with singles like “DiE4u,” “​sTraNgeRs” and “LosT.” Unfortunately, Jordan Fish (electronics, percussion, vocals) left the band on December 22th, 2023.



The band’s logo is called “Antivist Symbol” and it’s  an unicursal hexagram, used since 2013’s Sempiternal release, because of the song “Antivist.” In Aleister Crowley’s Thelema, it means that everybody has one true goal in life.

Title: Drown
Release Date: October 21, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-drown-lyrics
Song Description: Ahead of their massive headlining show at Wembley Arena in December 2014, BMTH set out to write a new style of song for an arena sound. Vocalist Oli commented on the difference in his songwriting approach for such a show in an interview with Gigwise.

When we started this band, we were young and, I dont want to say we hid behind the noise, but thats just what you like when youre a kid. As we got older, our taste in music changes, and were just trying to reflect that with what we do, rather than trying to write something we wouldve ten years ago.

The song is about the expectations in life that can grow too much to bear, and about someone that could take that weight off your shoulders and help you back up.

Leading up the release of Drown, vocalist Oli Sykes uploaded parts of the lyrics to his Instagram, giving fans a sneak peak of the lyrical content.

The cover art and music video of this song feature the band dressed up in the style of The Beatles, and the music video features them playing in a space similar to that of The Beatles' performance on The Ed Sullivan Show.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
What doesn't kill you makes you wish you were dead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper, and I can't take
One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up

[Pre-Chorus]
It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I'm not okay and it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?

[Chorus]
Who will fix me now? Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
Who will make me fight? Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown

[Verse 2]
What doesn't destroy you, leaves you broken instead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper, and I can't take
One more moment of this silence, the loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up

It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me

Title: Can You Feel My Heart
Release Date: August 19, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-can-you-feel-my-heart-lyrics
Song Description: Can You Feel My Heart is the opening track and third single (fourth in the US) from Bring Me The Horizons fourth studio album Sempiternal. The song leads with Oliver Sykes depression.

The songs looped vocal pattern was created by Fish as Sykes couldnt think of lyrics that fit in the chorus, but they then became a significant part of the songs structure.

The song is credited by Sykes as:

Admitting you have a problem, and admitting somethings wrong. Thats the first step of the whole album.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel, can you feel my heart?

[Post-Chorus]
(Can you feel my heart?)

[Verse]
Can you help the hopeless? Well, I'm begging on my knees
Can you save my bastard soul, will you wait for me?
I'm sorry, brothers, so sorry, lover
Forgive me, father, I love you, mother

[Chorus]
Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel my heart?

[Post-Chorus]

Title: Parasite Eve
Release Date: June 25, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-parasite-eve-lyrics
Song Description: Parasite Eve, the second single from POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR, was recorded during the 2020s quarantine and, although the inspiration for the track didnt come from the COVID-19 pandemic, there are a lot of references to it. The title comes from a 1998 survival horror game of the same name released by Square. The band said:

Weve got to look that face to face. Weve got to confront it. Weve got to feel it. Weve got to breathe it. Weve got to live it sometimes to get through this. You know, its understandable that we want to repress these feelings, and sometimes becoming civilised requires us to repress aspects of ourselves that dont fit in with the structured ideal of our society.

During the promotion of the song, the band changed their helix logo for a broken version.

https://i.genius.com/216eaef899cc763ed135b758d159b1705517947a?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyt3.ggpht.com%2FqX5-nOMOOWj5QxuSCY6Dr9gsQ2Tys3lUujZoy6HS8VbDfz0ic-I2e49CgYR5a6FfKN2NilneTFdkRw%3Ds1080-nd

The song was expected to be released on 2020, June, 10th, but was postponed due to the George Floyd protests and all Black Lives Matter protests around the world. As Oliver Sykes stated:

So as some of you know we were planning on releasing a new track this week. But with the incredible movement that is taking place currently we dont feel comfortable releasing and promoting anything that takes the focus off whats important right now. I know you will all understand because we have the best fans in the world and I promise you we wont make you wait too long and the good news is more music will be coming soon after Parasite Eve too. But for now keep fighting the good fight and stay tuned.



The game tells the story of a cop named Aya who is fighting against a biological entity that calls itself Eve, who formed when a mitochondrial cell mutated and evolved, eventually becoming self-aware and seeking a host beyond humanity.

Eve threatens all life on Earth by causing her victims to spontaneously combust. The entity seeks to replace humanity with superior organisms that have control over their own DNA, and considers humanity to be a parasite leeching off the planet.

Also, when asked about what would he like to achieve on his last day alive, Oli Sykes said:

A speed run on Parasite Eves hardest setting.



Musically, it was influenced a lot by Oli Sykes playing a game called DOOM Eternal, as well as the contributions of the game soundtrack artist Mick Gordon, giving it a futuristic and cyber overlay.

Title: MANTRA
Release Date: August 21, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-mantra-lyrics
Song Description: MANTRA is a powerful but eerie alternative rock anthem that depicts how people blindly follow others. The highly-anticipated debut single off the bands sixth studio album has Oli asking for people to get behind him to start a cult.

Like their previous album, Thats The Spirit, this song along with the rest of the album was solely produced by Oli Sykes and keyboardist Jordan Fish to allow the band full autonomy of their sound. Oli spoke about this during an interview after the tracks world premiere on Annie Macs BBC Radio One Hottest Record show:

We want to do heavy in a completely different way. We wanna do catchy in a completely different way. I mean this is the hardest record we ever wrote and these songs are the hardest songs because we really challenged ourselves to do something completely different and not lean on anything weve done before.

The single and upcoming album were teased by the band via a phone number which, when called, announced small amounts of information about upcoming music as well as various social media posts.



The inspiration for this song comes from a Netflix documentary called Wild Wild Country about the cult leader Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his followers. Oli shared how the documentary influenced his writing on the song:

I was watching all these people devoted to this one guy, doing this crazy shit for him. As I was watching it and trying to write lyrics at the same time, I was drawing these similarities to cults and love.

Oli further explained how the song includes aspects from his divorce which took place before writing the new record:

Starting a relationshipespecially a marriageis like starting a cult, a small two-man cult, because you have to give yourself over completely to this person, you have to trust them, you have to love them unconditionally even if you start thinking This is a bit suspect or This is a bit dodgy. Thats what a relationship is, its exactly the same as a cult so thats where the thinking behind the song came from.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Do you wanna start a cult with me?
I'm not vibrating like I oughta be
I need a purpose, I can't keep surfing
Through this existential misery
Now, we're gonna need some real estate
But if I choose my words carefully
Think I could fool you that I'm the guru
Wait, how do you spell "epiphany"?

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Could I have your attention, please?
It's time to tap into your tragedy
Think you could use a new abuser
Close your eyes and listen carefully
Imagine you're stood on a beach
Water gently lapping at your feet
But now you're sinking, what were you thinking?
That's all the time we have this week
You might also like[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one

[Bridge]
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
But do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to believe
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
You know you gotta work the corners of your mind now
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to, so easy to believe

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
Oh!

Title: Follow You
Release Date: September 11, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-follow-you-lyrics
Song Description: Follow You has been acclaimed as the most romantic song by the band, as it is basically a love letter to band members' wives. Musically, the track features a heartbeat sound surrounded by handclaps, synths, and layered vocals.

Jordan [Fish, keyboards] and I wrote this while we were writing Drown. I love how, when it starts, its like, Right, how is this going to be a Bring Me The Horizon song? And even though its not like any song youve heard from us before, it all makes sense.

Oliver Sykes, Kerrang!

Also, Oli explained through Twitter, the connection between the music video and the song:

https://twitter.com/olobersyko/status/710418671026438144

So, that explains why in the video, the character is roaming the streets calmly as a zombie apocalypse is underway.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
My head is haunting me and my heart feels like a ghost
I need to feel something, 'cause I'm still so far from home
Cross your heart and hope to die
Promise me you'll never leave my side
Show me what I can't see when the spark in my eyes is gone
You got me on my knees, I'm your one-man cult
Cross my heart and hope to die
Promise you I'll never leave your side

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm telling you, you're all I need
I promise you, you're all I see
'Cause I'm telling you, you're all I need
I'll never leave

[Chorus]
So, you can drag me through hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you

[Verse 2]
Come sink into me and let me breathe you in
I'll be your gravity, you be my oxygen
So dig two graves, 'cause when you die
I swear I'll be leaving by your side

Title: Ludens
Release Date: November 6, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-ludens-lyrics
Song Description: Ludens is the lead single from POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR and it was made in one week for videogame DEATH STRANDING: Timefalls original soundtrack.

Ludens is the name of Kojima Productions company icon and mascot. However, the character isnt present in DEATH STRANDING. When asked about the identity of the mascot, Hideo Kojima responded:

Thats everyone, thats us, thats the users, thats each one of us wearing that skull mask.



The tagline of Kojima Productions is From Sapiens to Ludens. The Latin word Ludens simultaneously refers to play and practice. More to it, the game character Die-Hardman wears a carbon skull mask with Ludens text on the forehead.



Lyrically, the song is political, as Oli Sykes said:


I dont want to come across as a hypocrite. Our music has always been about human emotions and the human condition. Ive never tried to talk about how the world is. Ive just been thinking about how I can start talking about it. Im not a politically-charged person. I dont want to be. I dont want to talk about politics and I dont want to sing about politics, but if youre talking about environmental issues then you cant talk about one without the other. It just felt like a great way to start talking about that.

It uses quotes from the game and stuff, but Im talking about the bigger picture. We need to be our own heroes. We need a new way of looking at things. Greta Thunberg has shown us thatits crazy, but this kid has proven that we can be our own leaders. We dont need to wait for these other people. It goes through the motions of whats wrong with the world and what we can do to fix it.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Some resist the future, some refuse the past
Either way, it's messed up if we can't unplug the fact
That a world covered in cables was never wired to last
So don't act so surprised when the program starts to crash

[Pre-Chorus]
(How do I) Form a connection when we can't even shake hands?
You're like a phantom greeting me
We plot in the shadows, hang out in the gallows
Stuck in a loop for eternity

[Chorus]
Do you know why the flowers never bloom?
Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden
(A new Luden, new Luden, yeah)
So come outside, it's time to see the tide
It's out of sight, but never out of mind
I need a new leader, we need a new Luden

[Verse 2]
Sticks and stones may break my bones but soon the sting will pass
But names can dig so many graves, you won't know where to stand
And I don't feel secure no more unless I'm being followed
And the only way to hide myself is to give 'em one hell of a show

Title: Happy Song
Release Date: July 12, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-happy-song-lyrics
Song Description: On July 5, 2015, Bring Me The Horizon started a mystery online campaign. The image of a white umbrella on a black background took over their social media and official website, causing fans to wonder whether new music was to be released soon. On July 12, the official audio for Happy Song was released on Youtube.

Happy Song shows the band moving in the same musical direction that surprised many fans with their 2014 single Drown. There is more of an emphasis on melody and production than the heavy metalcore riffs and breakdowns of previous BMTH music. Talking to Gigwise after their mammoth Wembley show in December 2014, Oli said the new album would have them pushing themselves further, writing different songs to those of ten years ago.

Happiness doesnt sell that well pains better to listen to

Oli also told Billboard Magazine:

Happy Song is a sarcastic open letter to the world about how we use superficial and trivial things to ignore the real problems.
Lyrics:

[Refrain]
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it, let's go!

[Verse 1]
I've had enough
There's a voice in my head, says I'm better off dead
But if I sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song, I'll be alright
You want to give up
Gave it all that you've got and it still doesn't cut
But if you sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song, you'll be just fine, 'cause…

[Chorus]
Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles

[Refrain]
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it

We're all fucked in the head, alone and depressed
But if we sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song, maybe we'll forget, 'cause…

[Chorus]
Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles
Don't wake us up, we'd rather just keep dreaming
'Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help, but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles, I'm going 'round in circles

[Breakdown]
The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess of hate and unrest
So let's all sing along a little goddamn louder
To a happy song and pretend it's all okay (Let's go)
So let's sing along
Let's sing along
A little fucking louder
A little fucking louder
Well, don't you feel so much better?
[Refrain]
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it (Well, that's the spirit)
S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
Let's hear it (Yeah, that's the spirit)

Title: Doomed
Release Date: September 11, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-doomed-lyrics
Song Description: Doomed was the first non-single heard from the album as the band previewed it on August 28th. The title describes the mood expressed in this song: doom to the point where one feels like a corpse before accepting his inescapable depression and embracing it mockingly to cope.

Jordan Fish told Kerrang!:

Doomed was originally going to be called What a State. But the whole track changed, so we decided that the name should change with it too. Theres a little fun fact for you! These words are actually still in there, if you listen closely to the songs, you can hear a quiet what a state in between each of the verses. And thats me youre hearing!

In the Track by Track commentary, Oli also admitted that the song is about embracing and celebrating the darkness rather than trying to hide it or lock it away.

Doomed was the first track that we wrote for the album and it was also the last track we finished. It was always intended to be the first song on the album. We wanted to open with something that made it clear that this record isnt going to be what youve heard before from us.








Doomed samples sounds from the drug scenes featured in the 2000 film Requiem for a Dream.
Lyrics:

[That's The Spirit Tour Extended Intro]
Sometimes I wonder why are we all here
Call me a nihilist, I guess I'm just unclear
To why I bother, why I try
Death is on my mind so much, it makes me wanna die
I lost my wife this year, we've lost our friend
Always fighting battles, but it never seem to end
Are we just ladders in the world of snakes?
'Cause if life's one big fuckin' game, well, I don't wanna play
So come and sing me, sing me to sleep
I dealt with too much fuckin' shit and now I'm in too deep
Cut off my wings, my flowers bloomed
You want salvation? Well, I'm sorry, we're all doomed

[Verse 1]
Cut off my wings and come lock me up
Just pull the plug, yeah, I've had enough
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
You're all vampires, so here

Title: Throne
Release Date: July 23, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-throne-lyrics
Song Description: Throne is the second official single released for Thats The Spirit. Keyboardist Jordan Fish told Rolling Stone that the song represents a completely new musical and emotional space for the band:

Its one of the most simple and straightforward songs we did Its got some elements we had on the last album [2013s Sempiternal], with an up-tempo rhythm and really strong melodies. So it seemed like an obvious choice for the first single because its so immediately catchy and has such a good level of energy

The song reflects a more positive outlook on life than previous BMTH material. Fish states that this reflects the upcoming albums theme.

Everyone has their own issues and anxieties, and mostly the new songs are about accepting them and trying to remain positive because theres nothing else you can do.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothin' could take the pain away

[Chorus]
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne

[Verse 2]
The sticks and the stones that you used to throw have
Built me an empire, so don't even try
To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive ya
You are the reason I still fight

[Chorus]
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne

Title: ​n/A
Release Date: May 24, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-n-a-lyrics
Song Description: This song addresses addiction and the desire to escape. The song expresses a sense of despair and hopelessness, reflecting Oli Sykes' personal struggles with mental health and addiction.

The name of the song is n/A  which means Not Available or Not Applicable, but given the introduction at the meeting and the topic of drug addiction, it could also mean Narcotics Anonymous

Bring Me The Horizon recorded this verse during NeX GEn World tour in Cardiff on 01/09/2024, in Birmingham on 01/12/2024, in Manchester on 01/13/2024, in Glasgow on 01/14/2024, in Newcastle on 01/16/2024, in Sheffield on 01/19/2024, in Dublin on 01/23/2024 and in others cities that was included in tour.



In an interview with NME lead singer Oli Sykes described the themes of this song in more detail, and he speaks about how he believes that most people who dont suffer from an addiction, think that getting on the horse is the hardest part. But, he goes on to say, its actually easy to get back on the horse, its staying on the horse that is the hardest part. This is an analogy many use, with the horse representing the journey to sobriety. Sykes goes on to explain that when you go back to being sober, its such a rough ride because you feel embarrassed, ashamed, like you let everyone down, and he says that all of these things are what influenced this song to be the way it is.

So from this song begins what Sykes calls the rehab portion of the album. At the start of n/A obviously the acronym for Narcotics Anonymous  he introduces himself to the room. A monstrous Greek chorus of fellow addicts (a live recording of fans at one of BMTHs recent gigs) reply, Hello, Oli, you fucking knobhead / Did you think you had us fooled? Of this relapse song, Sykes says,


Youd imagine that the hardest thing is getting back on that horse, but the hardest thing is staying on the horse once youre on, because when you get back on there, its such a rough ride.

You fucking hate yourself after youve relapsed again, when youve made a mistake. That feeling of, Fucking hell, Ive just let everyone down, Im so embarrassed, everyone hates me. You just want to go back to whatever it was that you were doing that takes all those feelings away temporarily.

Lyrics:

[Intro: Zakk Cervini]
Okay, folks, we've got a new face joining us
Why don't you go ahead and share a little bit about yourself?

[Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
Hi, my name's Oli and I'm an addict (Hi, Oli)
I'm here 'cause I'm not quite all there
'Cause what used to be my idea of a laugh is
Now just me checking my pulse in my underwear

[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
Thinking I should drop dead, eat shit, go to Hell
I could jump headfirst out the window
Dark thoughts keep on filling up in my mind, oh-oh
Kinda wanna get fucked, make love to a chainsaw
Wrap my drop-top 'round a lamppost
Not sure I'll be coming back down this time

[Verse 2: Oli Sykes]
Hello, Oli, you fucking knobhead
Yeah
Did you think you had us fooled?
And, baby, I know that I told you I was out of the woods
But I still left a kеy under the mat for the wolvеs

[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
So maybe I should drop dead, eat shit, go to Hell
I could jump headfirst out the window
Dark thoughts keep on filling up in my mind, woah
Kinda wanna get fucked, make love to a chainsaw
Wrap my drop-top 'round a lamppost
Not sure I'll be coming back down this time

Title: Sleepwalking
Release Date: March 1, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-sleepwalking-lyrics
Song Description: Sleepwalking talks about depression and ketamine addiction. Oliver was addicted to ketamine, as he said many times

[Ketamine] disengages users from reality, causing hallucinations and distorted perception. Its not cocaine. Its cheap, easy and fast It took my ego away. It took away who I was. I nearly killed myself. I just didnt care whether I lived or not. I was very close [to suicide]. I wanted to die.

The singer eventually attended rehab sessions but stated that he disagrees with many of the things that drug rehabilitation teach.

They helped me in there, but I didnt believe half the stuff they told me. This is not the hand that any of us wanted to be dealt. They tell you its a diseasethats bollocks. Its not a disease; its a self-inflicted problem. Its offensive to people with diseases to claim addiction is a disease. They said it would be a struggle every day, that youre an addict for the rest of your life. Bollocks. Its all bollocks. Ive never looked back since I got clean. I got clean for my family, my friends, and my band. I didnt get clean for God.

Oliver Sykes, NME

My secrets are burning a hole through my heart
And my bones catch a fever

Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe

It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking

Where do I go from here, do I disappear?
Edge of the world
Should I sink or swim or simply disappear?

Title: ​medicine
Release Date: January 3, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-medicine-lyrics
Song Description: medicine is the third single from BMTHs sixth studio album, amo. It has aggressive and directly angry lyrics, contrasting with romantic love songs like mother tongue.

The song centers around Oliver Sykes last relationship with Hannah Snowdon. Their marriage ended in a messy divorce in early 2016. While Oli has explained that the song ouch also talks about that situation, keyboardist Jordan Fish revealed that medicine is connected to that too.

Musically, the song focus on the pop and electronic side of the banddifferent from the last single, wonderful life, which was arguably the heaviest one on the album. This annoyed some old fans and the band also dissed them in heavy metal, as the song is directed to the hipster fans.

The official video for edcne subtly references artworks released for their 2010 album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me Ive Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Lets Keep It a Secret.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Some people are a lot like clouds, you know
(Clouds, you know, clouds, you know)
'Cause life's so much brighter when they go
You rained on my heart for far too long (Far too long)
Couldn't see the thunder for the storm
Because I cut my teeth and bit my tongue
Till my mouth was dripping blood
But I never dished the dirt, just held my breath
While you dragged me through the mud
I don't know why I tried to save you 'cause
I can't save you from yourself
When all you give a shit about is everybody else

[Pre-Chorus]
And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
I think it's time to stop

[Chorus]
You need a taste of your own medicine
'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowing
Watch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you
Act like nothing's real like you
So I'm sorry for this, it might sting a bit

[Verse 2]
Some people are a lot like clouds, you know
(Clouds, you know, clouds, you know)
'Cause life's so much brighter when they go
And I spent too long in a place I don't belong
I couldn't see the thunder for the storm

You need a taste of your own medicine

Title: Teardrops
Release Date: October 22, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-teardrops-lyrics
Song Description: Teardrops is the fourth single from POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR. It talks about kids growing up in todays age with tech addiction being common place and the problems of it.

It also talk about depression and anxiety. The music video represents Sykes struggles with his mental health and drug abuse, but he overpassed it because of Bring Me The Horizon bandmates.

It is my favourite song off the record. Im so excited to get this single out, it feels like a classic Bring Me The Horizon tune but without it feeling like anything weve done before. I feel like Teardrops is some of the best work weve ever done, musically and lyrically as whole.

Oli Sykes, NME
Lyrics:

[Intro: Oliver Sykes]
Teardrops

[Verse 1: Oliver Sykes]
We hurt ourselves for fun
Force-feed our fear until our hearts go numb
Addicted to a lonely kind of love
What I wanna know

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
Is how we got this stressed out, paranoid
Everything is going dark
Nothing makes me sadder than my head

[Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops
I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing
The emptiness is heavier than you think

[Verse 2: Oliver Sykes]
I'm tripping on the edge
High as a kite, I'm never coming down

I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me
Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing

Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind
Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ

Release Date: April 1, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-hospital-for-souls-lyrics
Song Description: In a track-by-track interview, vocalist Oli Sykes explained:

It kind of ties in with the concept of the album, and if anyone buys a physical copy, theyll see that theres almost like a track-by-track on it. Each song is a step, or a process, to another place its all wrapped up if you go and buy the album! And its my dads favourite track!



In another interview, bassist Matt Kean shared:

This is the most emotional Ive ever heard Olis lyrics. I remember the first time I listened to it, I was out of the country and I texted them straight away, I was like, This is crazy. I just remember thinking how awesome it was gonna be when we got it recorded and stuff. Its an awesome way to end the albumwe shouldve given away a free box of tissues with it.
Lyrics:

[Spoken]
"And then I found out how hard it is to really change
Even Hell can get comfy once you've settled in
I just wanted the numb inside me to leave
No matter how fucked you get
Sorrow is there when you come back down
Funny thing is, all I ever wanted I already had
There's glimpses of heaven in every day
In the friends I have, the music I make, with the love I feel
I just had to start again"

[Verse 1]
The days are a deathwish
A witch-hunt for an exit
I am powerless
The fragile, the broken
Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless
Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Silent halls and nameless faces
I am powerless

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wants to go to Heaven, but nobody wants to die
I can't fear death, no longer, I've died a thousand times
Why explore the universe when we don't know ourselves?
There's an emptiness inside our heads that no one dares to dwell

How does that make you feel?
Have you ever took a blade to your wrists?

How does that make you feel?

Title: ​mother tongue
Release Date: January 22, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-mother-tongue-lyrics
Song Description: According to Jordan Fish, mother tongue is the spiritual successor of Drown. The track is a love song dedicated to Oliver Sykes wife, Alissa Salls.

Mother tongue is the language that a person has been exposed to from birth and this is part of the personal, social and cultural identity of a child for the rest of his life. This said, the song has this title because theres some Portuguese in itSalls first language. Shes Brazilian and is important for the album as a whole, as amos a concept album about love and Sykes felt in love with her.

Its a love song, so its an emotional one.

This is for her, the album is dedicated to Alissa.



On May 9th, Bring Me The Horizon released a music video for the song. The film is a love story, starting with a woman wandering out of a grocery store and into an apartment complex. She meets a man and hands him a book titled Supernova, and a ring on her necklace begins to move. Once inside the apartment, she tries to get closer, but it seems as though some kind of psychic power starts to violently move everything around them. They eventually calm down and settle into the chaos and become encased in some kind of jelly-looking primordial ooze as they embrace in the air. And Oli and the rest of the band start floating too.

Their relationship is similar to a supernova, an event that occurs upon the death of certain types of stars. When a star runs out of fuel, it enters into a constant battle between the forces of gravity and fusion, this can be interpreted as all the chaos that surrounds the couple in the music video. When gravity finally wins the battle against fusion, the star collapses and eventually explodes, but after that massive explosion, everything settles down and the star becomes a neutron star or a black hole. One can interpret this explosion and eventual calmness as how things start levitating in the music video but eventually, everything settles down and the couple find peace and love.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I didn't see it coming (Coming)
But I never really had much faith
In the universe's magic (Magic), oh, no
Till it pulled us to that time and place
And I'll never forget
When the floodgates opened, we, we cried an ocean
It still has me choking; it's hard to explain
I know you know me, you don't have to show me
I, I feel you're lonely, no need to explain

[Chorus]
So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me, fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue

[Verse 2]
And yeah, I could be punching
But I always tend to fluctuate
And I feel sick that I'm buzzing, oh, love, I'm in trouble
I'm sorry, but you got me gushing all over the place
I never wanna get wet
But I think we're chosen like our fates were woven
And all of those bad choices were left turns on the way

Release Date: January 11, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-shadow-moses-lyrics
Song Description: Shadow Moses is the lead single from Bring Me The Horizons fourth album Sempiternal.

Also, six years after the release of 2013s Shadow Moses, Bring Me The Horizon entered in the soundtrack of Hideo Kojimas DEATH STRANDING, a 2019 game from the same creator of Metal Gear.

In a track-by-track interview with MetalFuckingSucks, vocalist Oli Sykes explained:

We actually never intended for it to be a single! We had that Warped Tour show last year and thought itd be a good song to play and maybe put out for free, to bridge the gap between our last record and this new one, and its good to play live. But, management said This songs too good, you cant put that out for free! It came out a lot better than we ever anticipated, but I still think its the safest track on the record.  We also thought having the single as track six was a great statement because it showed the level of this album. Most bands have the single as the first track on their album.

In another track-by-track interview, this time with SugarScape, bassist Matt Kean revealed:

The title is from a computer game called Metal Gear Solid. Its the opening bit with the people like doing the spooky singing, thats a melody from the game a lot. I think weve had songs in car racing games or something, but we all want one in FIFA or something cool like that.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Can you tell from the look in our eyes (We're going nowhere?)
We live our lives like we're ready to die (We're going nowhere)
Can you tell from the look in our eyes (We're going nowhere?)
We live our lives like we're ready to die (We're going nowhere)

[Verse 1]
I thought I'd buried you and covered the tracks
You'll have to take this with your cold dead hands
I thought I'd buried you, what's dead can never die
I thought I'd cut you loose, severed the feeling
I slipped through the cracks and you caved in my ceiling
I thought I'd buried you, what's dead can never die, fuck

[Chorus]
Can you tell from the look in our eyes (We're going nowhere?)
We live our lives like we're ready to die (We're going nowhere)
You can run, but you'll never escape (Over and over again)
Will we ever see the end? (We're going nowhere)

[Verse 2]
This is sempiternal, will we ever see the end?
This is sempiternal over and over, again and again
"Rise from the dead," you say
Secrets don't sleep till they're took to the grave
Signal the sirens, rally the troops
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the moment of truth

Can you tell from the look in our eyes (We're going nowhere?)
We live our lives like we're ready to die (We're going nowhere)
You can run, but you'll never escape (Over and over again)
Will we ever see the end? (We're going nowhere)

Title: True Friends
Release Date: September 11, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-true-friends-lyrics
Song Description: On August 21, 2015, the band posted a teaser for True Friends on their Facebook page. Along with the teaser video, the band shared that they have sent the song to Zane Lowe to play on Apple Music Beats 1 later in the week. On August 23, the full song was released.



In the track-by-track commentary of Thats The Spirit on Spotify, vocalist Oli Sykes shared:

True Friends is about certain people about a situation that really cut me up. But to be honest, it applies to a lot of people Ive known throughout my life. I dont hold hate or anger towards anyone, maybe I used to but its just too draining of an emotion. And this song is about making peace with those situations. Its about letting those people know that I can forget but I never will forgive. From here on out, Ill always keep them at arms length.

On November 5, 2015, a music video, directed by frontman Oliver Sykes, was released on the bands Vevo channel.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know?
True friends stab you in the front

[Verse 1]
It's funny how things work out
Such a bitter irony like a kick right to the teeth
It fell apart right from the start
But I couldn't even see the forest for the trees

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm afraid you asked for this
You got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now

[Chorus]
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

It's kind of sad, 'cause what we had
Well, it coulda been something, I guess it wasn't meant to be
So how dare you try and steal my flame just 'cause yours faded?
Well, hate is gasoline, a fire fueling all my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm afraid you asked for this
You got a lot of nerve, but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now

[Chorus]
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

[Bridge]
You can run, but you can't hide
Time won't help you, 'cause karma has no deadline
You can run, but you can't hide
Time won't help you, 'cause karma has no deadline
[Chorus]
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget, but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know
True friends stab you in the front?
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

Title: Avalanche
Release Date: September 11, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-avalanche-lyrics
Song Description: According to interviews, Avalanche is about ADHD and Olivers visits to doctors because of his addiction to Ketamine.



Avalanche is about ADHD. I guess its weird when youre 25-26 and your doctor tells your brain is missing something. Its got like a missing link I guess. But at the same time it was a huge release to discover and a massive step in my recovery to find out a huge part of my addiction was self-medicating.

Oliver Sykes, Music and Riots
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Cut me open and tell me what's inside
Diagnose me, 'cause I can't keep wondering why
And no, it's not a phase, 'cause it happens all the time
Start over, check again, now tell me what you find

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?

[Chorus]
It's like an avalanche, I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance, my heart has frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice

[Verse 2]
Am I broken? What's the chance I will survive?
Don't sugarcoat me, 'cause I feel like suicide
Just give it to me straight, 'cause I'm running out of time
I need an antidote, now what can you prescribe?

[Chorus]
It's like an avalanche, I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance, my heart has frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice
And I'm going under

Title: Obey
Release Date: September 2, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-obey-lyrics
Song Description: Obey is a long time awaited Bring Me The Horizon collaboration with YUNGBLUD and third single from POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR. The song talks about the oppression that people suffer because of world leaders and politicians. It is written mostly from the point of view of the oppressor, as Oli Sykes told Forbes:

It was written in April, May, of this year, and it was very much inspired by everything thats going on, and very much from the side of the oppressor. I think everyone has been stopped in their tracks, and I think a lot of people are realizing that maybe the people in charge arent looking out for our best interest. The way that were fed traumatic and devastating news on a daily basis, I think the powers that be or whatever you want to call them, theyve gotten very good at getting us desensitized to this information, and we have been sleepwalking for a while where we know all this horrible stuff is going on, but we didnt do anything about it.

The track was officially teased with an Oli Sykes post with a QR code leading to a website with a snippet of the music video.

Directed by Sykes, the music video features him and YUNGBLUD inside giant robots, each one trying to command the city and fighting. In the end, both realize that they just want to be together.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Oliver Sykes]
Another day, another post-traumatic order
(Brainwashed and feeling fine)
I bit off more than I could chew when I looked closer
So I stabbed a fork in my eye

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
Think I'm losing my fucking mind
Don't know where to turn, now I'm blind
Destroy yourself, it feels so good to fade away
Why do you wanna hurt yourself?
Die for something else?
Don't let your conscience get in the way

[Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
Obey, we hope you have a lovely day
Obey, you don't want us to come out and play away now, now
There's nothing to see here, it's under control
We're only gambling with your soul
Obey, whatever you do
Just don't wake up and smell the corruption

[Post-Chorus: Oliver Sykes & YUNGBLUD]
Do you feel that? Yeah

[Verse 2: YUNGBLUD]
Another day, another systematic nightmare
(Commemorate a wonderful life)
Bite me first, I'll bite you back, melodramatic laughter
I stabbed a knife in my eye

[Chorus: Oliver Sykes & YUNGBLUD]
Obey, we hope you have a lovely day
Obey, you don't want us to come out and play away now, now
There's nothing to see here, it's under control
We're only gambling with your soul
Obey, whatever you do
Just don't wake up and smell the corruption

[Breakdown: Oliver Sykes]
When your freedom is lethal
Tell me how you're gonna hurt yourself
You call yourselves peaceful
You monsters are people
You fucking monsters are people

[Bridge: Oliver Sykes & YUNGBLUD]
Obey, we're gonna show you how to behave
Obey, it's nicer when you can't see the chains
[Chorus: Oliver Sykes & YUNGBLUD]
Obey, we hope you have a lovely day
Obey, you don't want us to come out and play away now, now
There's nothing to see here, it's under control (It's under control)

In the dark, in the dark

I know I'm getting warm 'cause I feel so cold

I think we need to talk like now

[Chorus: Oli Sykes & KARRA]
So don't swear to God, He never asked you
It's not His heart you drove a knife through
It's not His world you turned inside out
Not His tears still rolling down

Title: 1x1
Release Date: October 30, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-1x1-lyrics
Song Description: 1x1 mainly talks about how humanity feel guilty remembering that they destroyed other species or even other people because of ethinical, religious, gender and sexuality differences.

[The song addresses] the guilt that we as a society carry for what weve done to other species and ethnicities and other genders.

Oli Sykes, NME

Just like Teardrops, the song can be related with Oli Sykes problems with addiction in the past. Quarantine could have brought back these dark memories and it shows him feeling guilty about it.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Oli Sykes]
Put me outta my misery

[Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
Disconnected from the world again
And no, the sun don't shine in the place I've been
So why you keep acting like I don't exist?
Yeah, feel like I'm ready to die, but I can't commit

[Pre-Chorus: Oli Sykes]
So I ask myself, when will I learn?
I'd set myself on fire to feel the burn
I'm scared that I'm never gonna be repaired

[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
Put me outta my misery, my mind
Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one

[Verse 2: Amy Love]
Sabotaged myself again
Got a brain like a hurricane
Me and that bitch, no, we can't be friends
And I don't even care, no
Got me sinking to a dark place (Outta love)
Evil twin under the staircase (Oh my God)
Think I'm looking at a long night
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone

Put me outta my misery, my mind

I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one

[Bridge: Oli Sykes]
And I'm staring into the void again
No one knows what a mess I'm in

But it's bad for my health, how much I hate myself
I suffocate, the weight, it pulls me underneath

[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
Put me outta my misery, my mind
Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go

Song Description: The first song the band sat down to write when starting to record Sempiternal and also the last song they completed. No one knows the meaning behind the song, according to Sykes,

The lyrics are so personal that they will mean nothing to anyone but my parents and me.

Before performing the song at Wembley, Sykes said:

This songs about bastards.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I've lost the plot again, tell your friends to sharpen their teeth
There's a few quid to be made
And my soul's a sorry state, so come on down, you empty lovers
(Worms come out of the woodwork) And the snakes start to sing

[Verse 1]
Do you feel the chill clawing at the back of your neck?
I start to spill, did you really think that you could fix me?
They'll sell your bones for another roll
Well, sharpen your teeth, tell yourself that it's just business

[Chorus]
Worms come out of the woodwork
Leeches crawl from out of the dirt
Rats come out of the holes they call home
I fall apart and the snakes start to sing

[Verse 2]
Don't say I'm better off dead
'Cause Heaven's full and Hell won't have me
Won't you make some room in your bed?
Well, you could lock me up in your heart and throw away the key
Won't you take me out of my head?
I'm just a woulda been, coulda been, shoulda been
Never was and never ever will be
Well, sharpen your teeth, tell yourself that it's just business
Woulda been, coulda been, shoulda been
Never was and never ever will be

If you can't soar with the eagles, then don't fly with the flock

Are you still getting by?
Was I your knight in shining armour, the apple of your eye?
Or just a step to climb?
If you can't soar with the eagles, then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting high?
Did you catch your own reflection in the knife my mother held?
Or the hell in my father's eyes?
If you can't soar with the eagles, then don't fly with the flock

Title: DiE4u
Release Date: September 16, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-die4u-lyrics
Song Description: DiE4u is the first single released from the follow-up LP to POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR which released in October 30, 2020, titled POST HUMAN: NeX GEn, which was released on May 24, 2024

The song blends influences of emo, pop, rock and contemporary music to create a style described by front-man Oli Sykes as future emo. Lyrically, the song deals with addiction from the perspective of a toxic relationship.

Its kinda like tackling the song as if this unhealthy obsession that I have is a relationship, and almost like a mistress really. []
[When youre in dealing with an addiction] its like youre having an affair for other people and stuff, cause youre doing this thing behind everyones back, its a secret, and it is like youre cheating on people or betraying people and stuff. I obviously never saw it in that way- I always just though Im just harming myself, Im not harming other people and I mean, I knew I was harming people but I didnt quite the level of how much it can fuck up peoples trust and stuff like that.

Oli Sykes, NME

Sykes himself has experienced drug addiction in the past, saying that it took away who he was and nearly resulted in him ending his own life. Sykes later found relief after attending rehab sessions, though disagrees with some of the principles used in his recovery.

In an interview with CD 92.2, a local alternative rock station based in Columbus, Ohio, Sykes delved further into the themes of addiction and recovery that the song explores. Sykes stated that the result of COVID-19 induced isolation forced him to deal with several aspects of himself that he thought he had healed from, saying:

It spiraled out of control, and I did what I did when those problems used to be more at the forefront. I started using again, abusing shitfor me, I had to sort all that shit out in lockdown. I couldnt go back into the world the way I wasDiE4U is all about the realization where I went, Fuck, I need to cut this part of me off and say This is not happening anymore, because it was very murky before, back when I was like Oh, I dont abuse drugs, but Ill still have a drink and Ill still have a smoke, or whatever and it was just, I was always leaving that door open and I needed to shut it.

Oli Sykes, CD 92.9 FM



The track was officially announced on September 2, 2021, but frontman Oli Sykes teased a master of the track on TikTok days prior, as well as the band having posted photos from the set of the music video to their social media.

Song Description: heavy metal features The Roots beatboxer Rahzel, the song is Oliver Sykes directly talking to the so-called hipster fans whove complained about the band moving away from their heavy sound to a more pop-oriented sound. Also, the song talks about the bands trajectory since signing with their first label to now. Oli commented about the bands direction in an now-deleted Instagram post:

i love how much this record is polarising peeps. Hasnt been like this since we released suicide season. A lot of kids were quick to shit all over it.. because it was something very different from the scene we was in.. I 100% support and encourage peoples true opinions and if you are someone whos only a fan of metal & hardcore with no exceptions, you are well within your right to hate this :) but if you are open to more.. all Im saying is if you judged this record after 1 listen, maybe go give it another 2. Im pretty confident youll surprise yourself But its so exciting to of made a record that makes people feel so much.. it feels so Bring Me The Horizon again. Thankyou for that. And if your loving the record please, stream it on repeat, like, 24/7 :)
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
I woke up in a warehouse but the label had fell off
Just minding my own meltdown
It was then I heard the cannibals, cannibals
They said, "Hey, kid"

[Pre-Chorus: Oli Sykes & Rahzel]
You got that something special, it's now or never
You wanna live forever, it's now or never
You know what we want, you should give it to us
It's now or never, but there's no pressure (Baby)

[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore
'Cause a kid on the 'gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
(And that's alright, that's alright)

[Verse 2: Oli Sykes]
I tried to do a head count but I cut off all the crusts
Said they liked it better curly (Yeah)
Then they gut me like an animal, animal
They said, "Hey, man"

[Pre-Chorus: Oli Sykes & Rahzel]
You had that something special, it's now or never
Let's keep it quintessential, it's now or never
You know what we want, why not give it to us?

Lyrics:

My dog just died, my friends hate me
I saw myself on MTV, and my ego is not my amigo (Yeah, yeah)

Stupid medicine, not doin' anything
What the hell is fucking wrong with me?
I guess there's no remedy, I'm so terribly lost

Imaginary enemies, suicidal tendеncies
Serotonin's proper on its arsе, oh-oh

The next time that I open up to someone will be my autopsy

Title: ​wonderful life
Release Date: October 21, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-wonderful-life-lyrics
Song Description: amos second single, wonderful life, has an ironic and dark vibe to it. The track shows a troubled narrator barely holding on to life but constantly referring to it as wonderful. The narrator, who seems to hold a dark and depressing view of the world around him, still enjoys the mundane and often gloomy aspects of everydayness.

 The song features Dani Filth, lead singer of the black metal band Cradle of Filth (he was also featured in the single artwork for the song).
Lyrics:

[Intro: Oli Sykes]
Hey, uh, are we rolling?
Yeah, okay, no, it's, that's fine
I read a fun fact about the brain and
How it starts to deteriorate when
We get to 27 or thereabouts (Yeah)
It got me thinking about my head
And what I can do to help stimulate it
Makes me sad, but I've forgotten what I'm on about
(Ah)

[Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
Looked on the bright side, got keratitis
And you can't sit there unless you're righteous
I wear a happy face like I'm Ed Gein
I feel all numb now, is that a feeling?
Like a plastic boxed orange with no peel on
I wanna waste, I wanna waste, I wanna waste away
(Yeah)

[Chorus: Oli Sykes & Jordan Fish]
Alone, getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life

Domesticated, still, a little feral
Well, don't you know to chew with your mouth closed?
(And it's all gone wrong)

[Chorus: Oli Sykes & Jordan Fish]
Alone, getting high on a Saturday night

[Bridge: Dani Filth, Dani Filth & Oli Sykes]
I got a type 2 kinda thirstiness
A far-out otherworldliness
And one day this might hurt me less
But everybody knows I'm still down
Don't tell me what the butcher does
There's no need for the obvious
So ugly, still, it's kinda lush
But everybody knows I made vows
Left feet on the podium
Can't think of an alternate
And hell yeah, I'm the awkwardest
But everybody knows I got bounce

Title: Dear Diary,
Release Date: October 30, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-dear-diary-lyrics
Song Description: The album POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR makes references to several video games. In Dear Diary, there are multiple allusions to the original Resident Evil. Most specifically, the song alludes to a diary entry found in the Spencer mansion known as the Keepers Diary. The book is notable for its intimate description of a T-Virus infection written by a researcher undergoing the process. As the author succumbs to the infection, the last entry infamously reads: Itchy. Tasty.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Dear diary, I don't know what's going on, but something's up
The dog won't stop barking and I think my TV is bust
Every channel is the same, it's sending me insane
And earlier, somebody bit me, what a fucking day

[Chorus]
The sky is falling, it's fucking boring
I'm going braindead, isolated
God is a shithead and we're his rejects
Traumatised for breakfast
I can't stomach anymore Survival Horror

[Verse 2]
Dear diary, I feel itchy like there's bugs under my skin
The dog's gone rabid (Shut the fuck up!) doing my head in
I keep fading in and out, I don't know where I've been
I feel so hungry, what the hell is happening?

[Chorus]
The sky is falling, it's fucking boring

Title: The House of Wolves
Release Date: April 1, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-the-house-of-wolves-lyrics
Song Description: An attack on organized religion and the idea of a deity. Bring Me The Horizon asks for a reason to believe with The House of Wolves.

In a track-by-track interview with MetalFuckingRocks, vocalist Oli Sykes explained:

Lyrically, its all about religion. Before we wrote this album, I was in a position where I was asked to believe in God, to get better, and I just couldnt understand that, so thats what I wrote from. Its about [how] theres no salvation, theres no one thats gonna save you. Youve got to get better because you want it for yourself, your family or your friends, not because you believe theres a man in the sky.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Show me a sign, show me a reason to give
A solitary fuck about your goddamn beliefs
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation you'll feel
Brick by brick, by brick
Brick by brick, by brick

[Verse 2]
What you call faith, I call a sorry excuse
Cloak and daggers murder the truth
The bitter taste, there's nothing else
I'll bow for your king when he shows himself

[Chorus]
Brick by brick, by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Whispers in a thousand tongues

[Verse 3]
Show me your face, show me a reason to think
My soul can be saved if I sell you my sins
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation for me

Title: Kool-Aid
Release Date: January 5, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-kool-aid-lyrics
Song Description: Kool-Aid explores the manipulative and abusive drive of a cult leader who, in the end, is willing to sacrifice his followers for the greater cause.

The title of the song is a reference to the Jonestown Massacre where 900 members of the Peoples Temple cult committed mass suicide upon the request of their leader, Jim Jones. They died from drinking cyanide and other sedatives in a fruit drink named Flavor Aid, which was originally misidentified as Kool-Aid. They later found needle marks, which meant some people were forced to die, making it a mass murder.

This is the sixth single from Bring Me The Horizons POST HUMAN: NeX GEns album. Within its overarching lore, Kool-Aid could be regarding the relationship within a cult/religion, more specifically The Church of GenXsis.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
We are the children of the devolution
The infamous martyrs, the scars on the sun

Title: ​sugar honey ice & tea
Release Date: January 25, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-sugar-honey-ice-and-tea-lyrics
Song Description: sugar honey ice & tea, arguably the albums heaviest track, mainly talks about intolerance and so it doesnt about love to a specific person. The track is still present on the album concept as it could be interpreted as the Love to an opinion.

This song kind of veers off the topic of love in terms of like personal stuff the most and its more talking about as a society and a world. And I guess peoples interpretation, however, ones got a different idea what love is, everyone has quite strong morals and beliefs these days, which is brilliant, but I think sometimes people are a little intolerant that they think that only theirs is important. If you think that you should vote in and you tell everyone else the wrong for not voting but that same person might eat meat where that other thinks that youre killing animals, Why would I vote for any of these people if theyre all supportive of that stuff? You know what I mean? And people are a little bit intolerant and a little bit like not understanding of other peoples beliefs and Im where we want to push things forward and I think thats what this song is about. []

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Count down the thunder
I think we're too close for comfort
So no, don't rock the boat and don't calm the storm
God already gave you His answer
Blink, I'm sorry, it's over, the whistle's been blown, I
Think you got the wrong number, I'm breaking up
Wanna make a connection, can't get no reception
Leave a message after the tone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's got my head running 24/7
I don't know if I can figure it out
It's all messed up, only one thing I know for sure
We're so full of

[Chorus]
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
(Everybody's full of)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea

[Verse 2]
Don't move a muscle
No, we can't have a struggle
But the situation is in control
So play pretend that it's all good
You could tell the Messiah
His pants are on fire, I politely decline, I
I gotta go, I gotta stick my head in the sand
And block out all the sadness, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Title: One Day The Only Butterflies Left Will Be In Your Chest As You March Towards Your Death
Release Date: October 30, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-one-day-the-only-butterflies-left-will-be-in-your-chest-as-you-march-towards-your-death-lyrics
Song Description: One Day the Only Butterflies Left Will Be in Your Chest as You March Towards Your Death is the final track of Bring Me The Horizons POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR. The song is a haunting ballad between Oli Sykes, representing humanity, and Amy Lee of Evanescence, representing Mother Nature.

The collaboration was a silver-lining after Evanescence sued the band over a verse from nihilist blues being extremely similar to their 2017 song Never Go Back. The lawsuit was eventually resolved with Amy Lee receiving songwriting credit for the song. After the suit, Evanescences team kept in contact with Bring me the Horizon. They were like, Amy really likes your band and would love to work with you, lead singer Oli Sykes said in an interview with NME.

The collaboration between the two artists came at a time when Amy Lee was feeling creatively stuck.

It was just a really fun escape from that little stuck moment that I was in, and it inspired me. It helped me feel, I dont know beautiful. The song is beautiful. That song is always gonna have a special place in my heart because I felt like, in a moment as an artist when I was stuck, another artist came along and helped me.

Amy Lee, Loudwire

According to Lee, the recording process took a week for the vocalist, and the experience was quite unique as Bring Me the Horizon are located in the U.K. while Lee resides in the U.S., with the pair having to guide each other over the phone vocally and deal with the time differences between the two of them.

[Verse 1: Amy Lee]
On the verge of no return, why'd you keep fucking it up?
Don't wanna have to bury you, but nothing seems to get through your skull
One day, the only butterflies left will be in your chest
As you march towards your death, breathing your last breath
I hate to say "I told you so," but look how the bruises show

[Chorus: Amy Lee]
Tell me, how's it gonna feel
Without my arms wrapped around, wrapped around you?
Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone
You were dead to the world, now I'm dead to you
Haunting your own house, nothing to lose
How did I let you sink your fangs so deep? Ah-ah
You know you can't breathe on your own

[Verse 2: Oli Sykes]
Past the point of rescuing, why'd I keep pushing my luck?
The hole I wore into your soul has got too big to overlook
One day, the only butterflies left will be in our chests
As we march towards our death, breathing our last breath
I thought we had a future, but we ain't got a chance in hell

Title: Oh No
Release Date: September 11, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-oh-no-lyrics
Song Description: Oh No is the poppiest song on Thats the Spirit and the albums last single. The record is a parody of the party songs:

Dont call it a party, cause it never stops

Oliver Sykes also said that:

Oh No is meant to be like this anti-dance song in a way but in doing so it sounds like a dance song. It sounds like something youd hear in a club. And its all about people who live for the weekend and people thats my age, 30 something or older, theyre still trying to live like 18 or 21. Theyre trying hard to have fun they dont even realize that theyre probably not even having any. []

Title: ​nihilist blues
Release Date: January 24, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-nihilist-blues-lyrics
Song Description: Featuring art-pop singer Grimes, nihilist blues is Olis personal favorite song on the album. The song talks principally about nihilism, focusing on the meaninglessness of life, existential crises and pessimism. Some of its lyrics have been teased in a video posted by BMTH, called amo [rec] vol. 1. Oli also talked about the collaboration with Grimes:

We saw an interview where she said she liked our band a few years ago. But my wifes obsessed with her and she was like, Shes not going to do it, she doesnt do collaborations, so when it came through it was like, Christ. Grimes said she listened to 30 seconds of it and was like, Yes, get me on this. It might sound cheesy, but just her acceptance of the track when she gets people asking her to collab all the time We were buzzing.

Musically, nihilist blues sets inspiration from old disco and EDM songs, as Jordan Fish commented:

Weve got a soft spot for that stufftacky 90s euro-sounding club stuff! The chorus melody in that song sounds to me like old school UK dance musiclike the notes are not quite right. Oli and I like that vibe, so we just took it where it wanted to go. On the last album, wed not have dared to do that. This time we didnt feel afraid to take it absolutely where it wanted to go.

There are some easter eggs on the music video:
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
I've been climbing up the walls to escape the sinking feeling
But I can't hide from the nihilist at my door
Buried in the basement floor, didn't know what I had planted
It blossomed with all the heart of a Cold War

[Pre-Chorus: Oli Sykes]
I'm a spirit in a tomb
Won't somebody raise the roof?
I'm going white, I'm going black, I'm going blue
Do you mind if I'm exhumed?
I'm the ashes in the plume
I'm a beggar in the ruin
I'm peaking out, I'm burning up, I'm shooting through
I'm only lonely for the truth

[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
Paradise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth
Paradise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth
Please, don't follow
Paradise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth
Please, don't follow

I'm the ashes in the plume
I'm a beggar in the ruin
I'm peaking out, I'm burning up, I'm shooting through
I'm only lonely for the truth

[Chorus: Grimes]
Paradise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth
Please, don't follow
Paradise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth
Please, don't follow
Please, don't follow
Please, don't follow
Please, don't follow
Please, don't follow
Please, don't follow

I've been climbing up the walls to escape the sinking feeling

Title: Don’t Go
Release Date: October 4, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-dont-go-lyrics
Song Description: Dont Go is the fifth track on Bring Me The Horizons 2010 album There Is a Hell, Believe Me Ive Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Lets Keep It a Secret. This song features pop singer Lights, making it her second and final appearance on the album. She first appeared on the opening track Crucify Me.

Superficially, it tells the story of a failing relationship and dealing with depression. But actually, this song isnt about relationships, depression and its not about Oli. It talks about the story of Terry Lee Hurst, a boy who was slaughtered by three adolescents., one of them being Olis cousin.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
I was raised in the valley, there was shadows and death
Got out alive, but with scars I can't forget
This kid back in school, subdued and shy
An orphan, and a brother, and unseen by most eyes
I don't know what it was that made a piece of him die
Took a boy to the forest, slaughtered him with a scythe
Stamped on his face, an impression in the dirt
Do you think the silence makes a good man convert?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Oli Sykes]
We all have our horrors and our demons to fight
But how can I win when I'm paralysed?
They crawl up on my bed, wrap their fingers 'round my throat
Is this what I get for the choices that I made?
God, forgive me for all my sins
God, forgive me for everything
God, forgive me for all my sins
God, forgive me, God, forgive me

[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
Don't go, I can't do this on my own
Don't go, I can't do this on my own
Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night
I can't live with myself, so stay with me tonight
(Don't go)
(Don't go)

If I let you in, you'd just want out
If I tell you the truth, you'd vie for a lie
If I spilt my guts, it would make a mess we can't clean up
If you follow me, you will only get lost
If you try to get closer, we'll only lose touch
But you already know too much and you're not goin' anywhere

[Bridge: Oli Sykes, Oli Sykes & Lights]
Tell me that you need me 'cause I love you so much
Tell me that you love me 'cause I need you so much
Tell me that you need me 'cause I love you so much
Say you'll never leave me 'cause I need you so much

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Oli Sykes & Lights, Oli Sykes]
Don't go, I can't do this on my own
Don't go, I can't do this on my own
Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night
I can't live with myself, so stay with me tonight
Don't go, I can't do this on my own
Don't go
Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night
I can't live with myself, so stay with me tonight
Don't go (Tell me that you love me)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
Started off as a one-night stand, lingered to a fling
The sirens and the sergeants didn't seem to mean a thing
Hide your fangs all you want, you still need the blood
Tell us that it's different now, you're up to no good

[Bridge: The Fredman Choristers]
Take my hand, show me the way
We are the children that fell from grace
Take my hand, show me the way
We are the children who can't be saved

[Pre-Chorus: Oli Sykes]
One more nail in the coffin, one more foot in the grave
One more time I'm on my knees as I try to walk away
How has it come to this?

[Chorus: Oli Sykes]
I've said it once, I've said it twice, I've said it a thousand fuckin' times
That I'm okay, that I'm fine, that it's all just in my mind
But this has got the best of me, and I can't seem to sleep
And it's not 'cause you're not with me, it's 'cause you never leave

One more time I'm on my knees as I try to walk away

Title: AmEN!

Song Description: This song is the fourth single off the upcoming EP and second instalment of the Post Human EP series : Post Human: NeX GEn, The track sees a return to classic Bring Me The Horizon heaviness.

The track holds heavy religious connotations with lines referring to repent and burning in hell. There is also numerous references to horror films such as The Exorcist and The Human Centipede. The track holds similar lyrical themes of  the Suicide Season track Chelsea Smile and sounds like a continuation of the style seen in Post Human: Survival Horror track Kingslayer ft. BABYMETAL
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
I hope you have fun rotting in hell
Swim the witch, slay the infidel
Suck a dick, heretic
I hate you
And I'd like to see you burn, burn, burn

[Chorus: Oli Sykes & Daryl Palumbo]
So tell all your friends
This is the end of everything
Too late to repent
The wicked will reap what they sow
We will sanctify (Rise, my brethren)
Purify (Purge out the sin)
Rejoice in their sorrow and sing
All hail Nex Gen (All hail Nex Gen)
Can I get an amen?

[Verse 2: Daryl Palumbo & Lil Uzi Vert]
Somebody call the exorcist
This is heresy, the child is possessed
(Subjugate the apostate)
Don't you know
You're so six-six-sick?
Yeah, you fanatics prey on me, hate on me
Patiently waiting to watch me bleed
Get your head from out of my ass
Got me feeling like a human centipede
Just let me breathe
Stay the fuck away from me
I don't really want me
As my own enemy

Title: Antivist
Release Date: February 19, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-antivist-lyrics
Song Description: Antivist is a sarcastic and angry track from BMTHs Sempiternal. It talks against slackvists, this is why the songs called antivist. The bands most political song.

In a track-by-track interview with MetalFuckingRocks, vocalist Oli Sykes explained:


Its about Slacktivists; online people that just talk shit on Twitter, and Like this if you want to get Obama to die or whatever. Its loads of shit; people think theyre making a difference nowadays just because theyre sat on their fat arses with ill-informed facts. They think they know everything and that theyre making a difference, and its bullshit.

So the lyrics to this one are quite sarcastic, but if you want to make a difference, you have to do more than just sit at your computer. Its not saying Dont care about the world, its saying, Dont think you care about the world and that youre better than people if youre doing fuck all. If you really believe in all that, youve got to get up and do more.


The antivist logo features prominently on some BMTH merchandise.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything? Question everything

[Verse 1]
The world is a shit tip, your children are fucked
The ones you think guard you are out for your blood
Well, our minds are battered and washed out with static
But what exactly do you think you're gonna do?

[Pre-Chorus]
United we'll fail, divided we'll fall
We're fucked, but you're making it worse
United we'll fail, divided we'll fall
Give up 'cause you're making it so much worse

[Chorus]
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything? Question everything

[Verse 2]
Oh, give me a break, you deluded, ill-informed
Self-serving pricks
If you really believe in the words that you preach
Get off your screens and onto the streets
There will be no peaceful revolution
No war without blood
You can say I'm just a fool that stands for nothing
Well, to that, I say you're a cunt

Song Description: What You Need is known for its lyrics filled with irony and dark humour; its about closed-minded individuals who only accept what theyve been brought up on, and refuse to open their ears to an alternative.
Lyrics:

You're hypnotised, can't see the signs
I'd like to help you, but I think it's too late
Made up your mind and now you're blind
I guess it's easier than making mistakes

You want a fight, but I won't bite on the bait
And I'm not tryna change your eyes, so don't panic
'Cause I'm not selling

So don't tell me what I can see
'Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this, but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Okay

[Verse 1]
I guess that some of us
Are just born with tragedy in our blood
It's just basic chemistry
Or maybe all these open wounds
Is how the light gets into you
'Cause I'm starting to realise

[Chorus]
No one's gonna come and rescue me
I'm drowning in my sleep
The scars have got too deep
And no amount of love could set you free
The fight's inside, I'll take myself to hell and back
Tonight we go to war

[Verse 2]
Someone put a gun
Straight to our hearts and paint the walls
With our love
There's a world of hurt in us (Someone)
And maybe once we spill our guts (With our love)
We can stitch ourselves back up
Yeah, I'm starting to realise

But once you hit the bottom
At least there's nowhere to go but up
Yeah, I know that you're low
But once you hit the bottom
At least there's nowhere to go but up

Yeah
The hardest thing you'll ever know
Is there's no love like your own

The scars have got too deep

I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue
It's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know, oh

It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Like pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now fallin' and failin' is all I know

This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse

I'm buried but breathing in regret

I'm buried but breathing in regret

Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Oli Sykes, Oli Sykes & Hannah Snowdon]
Eyes like a car crash
I know I shouldn't look, but I can't turn away
Body like a whiplash
Salt my wounds, but I can't heal the way I feel about you
I watch you like a hawk
I watch you like I'm gonna tear you limb from limb
Will the hunger ever stop?
Can we simply starve this sin?

[Chorus: Oli Sykes, Oli Sykes & Hannah Snowdon]
That little kiss you stole, it held my heart and soul
And like a deer in the headlights, I meet my fate
Don't try to fight the storm, you'll tumble overboard
Tides will bring me back to you

[Verse 2: Oli Sykes]
And on my deathbed
All I'll see is you
The life may leave my lungs
But my heart will stay with you

[Chorus: Oli Sykes & Hannah Snowdon]
That little kiss you stole, it held my heart and soul
And like a ghost in the silence, I disappear
Don't try to fight the storm, you'll tumble overboard
Tides will bring me back to you

Title: DIg It
Release Date: May 24, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-dig-it-lyrics
Song Description: Bring Me The Horizons song DIg It delves into the depths of existential dread and the struggle to find meaning in a seemingly chaotic world. The song opens with a cryptic, almost dystopian message, setting the tone for a narrative that explores themes of disillusionment and internal conflict. The lyrics paint a picture of someone grappling with their own emotions and the harsh realities of life, feeling betrayed by the fable theyve been fed and unable to remain silent any longer.

The chorus reveals a profound self-loathing and a sense of failure, with the protagonist expressing regret and a desire to disappear. This is juxtaposed with a plea for something to believe in, a system override to give their existence purpose. The recurring theme of addiction to hiding from reality suggests a cycle of avoidance and despair, highlighting the difficulty of confronting ones own pain and the fear of healing.

The songs repeated references to a scary place and scary future underscore a pervasive sense of anxiety about the world and the human condition. The metaphor of life as a grave that the protagonist digs reflects a nihilistic view, where the only certainty is suffering. The closing lines, with the malfunctioning personal multidimensional friend, add a layer of technological alienation, suggesting that even our attempts to find solace in artificial intelligence are fraught with errors and failures. DIg It is a raw and unflinching exploration of mental anguish, societal disillusionment, and the search for meaning in a fractured world.

Release Date: September 11, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-blasphemy-lyrics
Song Description: Blasphemy is about cynical people that will not let go of their beliefs, even though they dont actually believe them. Oli Sykes explained to Kerrang!:

What they preach contradicts what they know to be true, but they wont turn the back on itmaybe because they feel responsible to carry it on. It makes no sense to me!
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
You got hell to pay, but you already sold your soul
It's blasphemy, but the words don't make sense no more
What would your mother say? Your faith has you immured
So don't try and tell me that you still believe
No, don't preach to me

[Verse 1]
Ask no questions and you'll get no lies
Turn the cheek and blind the eye
Let it go…
Bend the knee and give away your life
Bite your tongue and close your mind
Never know…

[Chorus]
'Cause you got hell to pay, but you already sold your soul
It's blasphemy, but the words don't make sense no more
What would your mother say? Your faith has you immured
So don't try and tell me that you still believe
No, don't preach to me

Title: ​i don’t know what to say
Release Date: January 25, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-i-dont-know-what-to-say-lyrics
Song Description: Described as an orchestra-meets-metal piece, i dont know what to say talks about Oliver Sykes friend Aidan who passed away because of cancer. Although it sounds like a posthumous song, it was originally written before he died. Oli also talked about the song to NME:

Its me nervously saying things because I didnt get to see him before he died. It was scary to think about, because how can you talk to someone before they die? You cant tell them its going to be alright when you know its not. Its also about how brave he was. If I had a time stamp put on my life Id just be so selfish and scared and be like, Fuck the world. How do you even get out of bed with that weighing down on you?

Aidan was at the Bring Me The Horizons Teenage Cancer Trust show at Royal Albert Hall and Oli spread some words for him before playing Drown:

https://vimeo.com/207439435

Sadly, on March 3rd, 2017, his cancer returned and Sykes talked about it in his Instagram account:


This week we were hit with the devastating news that Aidans cancer has returned, with a tumour in his neck and bone marrow metastases throughout, and the NHS has no more treatment they can offer him. His life expectancy is short. We are desperately searching for some pioneering treatment that could save his life, there are cases of people beating this disease in US and Mexicobut its going to take not only a miracle but a lot of help from everyone that can.

We refuse to give up, but even if surgery is not an option, we want to make sure that Aidan has the funds to see some amazing fucking sunsets in some amazing places. Whatever happens, the money will be helping those who need help beating this ruthless disease. []


Unfortunately, he died on 24 April, 2017.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'll see you at the gates when it gets dark
You jump the wall, I’ll find a place to park
Kill the angels if they're keeping guard
How do I start when you don't know what to say?
No, I don’t know what to say

[Verse 2]
You said the world's already full enough
Of defeated people and you would not be one
Always a choice to move yourself along
And find better and I hope that's where you are
Yeah, I know that's where you are

[Verse 3]
A doppelgänger with a telling scar
I saw the universe hidden in your heart
Wish I told you this before it got too dark
Where do you start when you know it has to end?

[Bridge]
How a flower in the rain
Only grows more when it's grey
You just shined on brighter
Making gold out of the pain
"I can die, but I can't break," you said
"You can rule, I won't obey"
As long as I'm still smiling
Well, I don’t know what to say

Title: ​why you gotta kick me when i’m down?
Release Date: January 25, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-why-you-gotta-kick-me-when-im-down-lyrics
Song Description: why you gotta kick me when im down? came, according to Jordan Fish, years ago when he created the beat. It talks about Oliver Sykes relationship with the fans. Oli has spoken about it:

I played it one of my matesall of us have got mates outside the band that we use as trusted, honest sounding boardsand when I played him that, he burst out laughing, saying it was the heaviest thing hed ever heard. Its not guitar-based heavy, its urban heavy. And his reaction made me go back the guys and say: We need to finish this.

This song may be a prediction of the way that some fans have perceived the new album. In an Instagram post he spoke about how he felt they were well within their right to hate this.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I see you, you on the edge of your seat
Ain't you got some place to be?
Was hoping the suspense would kill you
Tell me, how would you begin?
Watching and waiting to sink your teeth in
Come on and give me your expert opinion, ah, fuck it
I settle down in a dump
Heard a crowd screaming "Jump"
So I came to the window
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
I said, "What the fuck have I done?"
They said, "We just want your blood
You know we like you better in limbo"
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)

[Pre-Chorus]
So come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough
Don't let the fact that you know nothing stop you talking now
'Cause when all is said and done, my name's still on your tongue

[Chorus]
But tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around (Ooh)
And why you tryna put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed? (I'm a seed) I won't stop at the roof
Go ahead, bury me; this is how I grow, it's how I thrive (Ooh)
So why you gotta kick me when I'm down? (Down)

What doesn't kill me, well, it better run like hell

[Bridge]
Remember this line that you crossed
Look back and stare at the dot
Know there's no turning back now
Now, that you've opened the gates
Corrupted the memory, error, failsafe
(Commence the countdown)
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
Remember this line that you crossed
Look back and stare at the dot
Know there's no way to fix us, no
Oh, God, what the fuck have you done?
I loved you like daughters, I loved you like sons

Title: ​liMOusIne
Release Date: May 24, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-limousine-lyrics
Song Description: liMOusIne was first teased at the Cardiff Show during the NeX GEn Tour. It was initially rumored to feature Billie Eilish after Billie posted an Instagram picture in January 2023 and Oli Sykes replied with: Limousine However, these rumors turned out to be false when the album tracklist dropped to show AURORA as the featured artist instead. Oli would later reveal in an interview that AURORA was one of his first choices for the feature.

In an interview with BBC Radio 1s Daniel P. Carter, frontman Oli Sykes went into more detail about the themes behind this song:

Its like the duality to that song [YOUtopia], it is the other side of the coinits a song about just going You know what? Im just going to take the quick buzz. Im not going to go down the long hard path of self love, and working on myself, and figuring out what makes me happy. Im just gonna have the e-vape and the quick likesI choose over stimulation because I know the other way is going to be more difficult, you know what I mean? It is taking the other path, where, I just wanna get the easiest, quickest, fastest way to feel something. Its something that Ive struggled with my whole entire life.

In the same interview, Oli also addressed the Billie Eilish rumors stating:

The Billie thing was just: her photographers a massive fan, and they kinda mentioned the idea of her doing a song. So I sent her liMOusIne. And this was quite a while before it was in its full, finished state. I mean, I cant say for 100 percent that she listened to it, but I knew it got to her. So me thinking that liMOusIne wouldnt mean anything to anyone but me and maybe her if she saw the comment, [I] left it on her Instagram, not thinking that a week or two later when we did the tour, we put the file names on our visuals live, and everyone connected it. It was one of them things that seemed like such a proper cheap way to try and get some press, but it really wasnt. I was actually quite embarrassed when I found out  like, Oh god, no! Because I knew the chance of Billie doing a song with us was slim to none.

PROPOSED SUGGESTION: > I know what I wanted on that song and that was someone to bring something that could level it up  someone like a really ethereal, haunting, beautiful, voice. I wanted someone to elevate it and take it somewhere else. The song itself is very Deftones-influenced, almost to a point of parody! For this whole record, were happy to admit that the songs all are very nostalgic homages to loads of bands, but its also felt very important that we do something where we were pushing it as well to make it our own, put our own stamp on it. AURORA was that person that helped elevate the song to something that feels exotic and different.

AURORA for me is what a pop star should be, what the next wave of pop stars should look like; someone that has the songs, but is a real person who dares to speak what they believe in, who gives a shit about the world.

Oli Sykes via NME

PROPOSED SUGGESTION: [liMOusIne] Its about the synthetic highs. When you get to step into a limo, its a complete detachment from reality. It represents a hedonistic lifestyle, all the empty highs and quick fixes, says Sykes to Rolling Stone
Lyrics:

I am an ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me

Only a shipwreck, only a ghost
Merely a graveyard of your former self
We just watched the waves crash over
And I've been cast astray

Song Description: Bring Me The Horizons R.i.p. (duskCOre RemIx) is a visceral and cathartic anthem that delves into the emotional aftermath of a toxic relationship. The songs aggressive tone and raw lyrics reflect a sense of betrayal and the subsequent liberation from a harmful connection. The opening lines, Did my back hurt your knife? Do you think youre bulletproof? immediately set the stage for a narrative of deceit and confrontation. The protagonist is addressing someone who has wronged them, making it clear that they are no longer willing to tolerate the lies and manipulation.

The recurring phrase Still alive but youre dead to me encapsulates the essence of the song. It signifies the emotional death of the relationship, even though both parties are physically alive. This line, coupled with the mention of voices in my head that will never leave, suggests lingering trauma and the struggle to move on from painful memories. The protagonists declaration of indifference, Plot twist, I dont give two shits about you or whether you exist, underscores their resolve to sever ties and reclaim their sense of self.

The song also touches on the idea of self-delusion and the impact of toxic behavior on mental health. Lines like Your therapist is gonna need some therapy and Out your fucking mind in a fantasy highlight the destructive nature of the other persons actions. The repeated refrain R-I-P serves as a final goodbye, a symbolic burial of the past, and a step towards healing. The songs intense energy and unapologetic lyrics make it a powerful expression of breaking free from toxicity and reclaiming ones life.

Title: ​sTraNgeRs
Release Date: July 6, 2022, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-strangers-lyrics
Song Description: Strangers is a song involving themes of depression and mental illness, but it also has an overall message of unity and togetherness, painting a picture that an entire room full of strangers could all be having the same struggles and insecurities. The single was released on Wednesday, July 6th. The Sheffield-based Bring Me The Horizon originally debuted at the Malta Weekender Festival, in which the chorus was first taught by Sykes to the audience in order to get them to sing along together.

In an interview with NME, lead singer Oli Sykes went on to explain that this song was a takeaway from him having to share his pain with other people. He goes on to say that the first time he went to rehab, it was a huge help to be surrounded by other people that were all suffering from something.

Just to be surrounded by people who were all going through something, I thought, Fuck, this is a human condition. This isnt just me. I thought I was insane, I didnt think I was ever going to get better, and Im listening to all these people saying all my thoughts, even though theyve been through things that were different  worseand obviously sTraNgeRs is that takeaway of like, were all just looking for security. Were all just lostits the first part of getting better, is the fact that youre gonna have to accept that youre gonna have to talk about this, no matter how bad what youve been through is. If you dont get it out of your head, its never going to go.

Sykes also went on to explain how he believes n/A, LosT and sTraNgeRs are all part of what he calls the rehab trilogy, with n/A being the group session, LosT being the 1 on 1 therapy session, and sTraNgeRs about the realization of sharing your pain with other people.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'll just be fucked up forever
Should have figured myself out by now
And I don't wanna tear myself open, no
But it's hard to care when you bleed out

[Pre-Chorus]
So won't you break me down, break me down
Make me get better
I confess I'm a mess, some kind of error
Well, maybe I was destined to disappear

[Chorus]
We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
We're just a room full of strangers

[Verse 2]
Well, I guess my guardian angel missed the memo
'Cause we're walking on razors again
And we swore to God we'd never let this happen, no
We've dragged ourselves through hell and we'll be damned if we go back

[Pre-Chorus]
Break me down, break me down
Make me get better
I confess that I'm a mess, some kind of error
Well, maybe I was destined to disappear

'Cause you and I, we're just dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, it don't

[Bridge]
Where did we go?
We're all alone, all alone
No place like home
Take us back to yesterday
S.O.S
Save us from ourselves

[Chorus]
We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die

Dying to live, living to die

In a track-by-track interview with MetalFuckingRocks, vocalist Oli Sykes explained:

Its quite Deftones-inspired, the feel. Lyrically its one of my favourites, because its one of the few where I wrote the lyrics before I wrote the melodies. Most of the time Ive found out that that doesnt work, but it gave me a lot of freedom.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
It's the start of the end, surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
And we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded, let 'em sing, let 'em sing

[Verse]
The deeper you dig, the darker it gets
There's nowhere else for us to go
We live what we learn, and then we forget
We'll never find our way back home, come on

[Interlude]
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

[Pre-Chorus]
They came like moths to a flame
You left like a house in a hurricane
The wolves are at my door

[Chorus]
It's the start of the end, surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
It's the start of the end, and we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded, let 'em sing, let 'em sing

Let the bastards sing, let the godforsaken bastards sing

The wolves are at my door
But I can't see the writing on the walls
The wolves are at my door
Waiting for my empire to fall

[Intro]
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you

[Verse 1]
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore

[Chorus]
If sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope, my friend, this is not the end

[Verse 2]
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him (Lost him), I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you

Death is only a chapter, so let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon, and I'm ready for my sun

Song Description: Crooked Young mainly talks about Oliver Sykes' ketamine rehabilitation.

In a track-by-track interview with MetalFuckingRocks, vocalist Oli Sykes explained:

Jordan [keyboardist] really wanted to do something like It Never Ends [from 2010s There Is A Hell], and we thought that was one of the songs that worked best on the last album, including that addition of an orchestra. We thought we could carry that on, so we wanted to keep that vibe. Its still one of the heaviest tracks on the record, and its got a great chorus. Im really excited to play that one live.

In another interview, bassist Matt Kean explained:

This song came about after we all went to go see a filmI forget which film it was, but it was a super epic film it had like a huge string section in itand we thought we need to write a song that uses cinematic strings section and is super epic sounding. So then Jordan went home that night and came back in the morning with this huge, middle string section, so we were like Lets use this! and then we wrote the song around that section.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
They had not worshipped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands
They life and reigned with Christ a thousand years
The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended
This is the first resurrection
Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection
The second death has no power
When the thousand years are over
Satan will be released from his prison and he will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth; Gog and Magog
And to gather them for battle
In number they are like the sand on the seashore
They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people, the city he loves
But fire came down

[Verse 1: Oli Sykes, Oli Sykes & Jona Weinhofen]
Ever since this began, I was blessed with a curse
And for better or for worse, I was born into a hearse
I know I said my heart beats for you, I was lyin', girl, it beats for two
'Cause I've got your love when I've got these vices

[Chorus: Oli Sykes, Oli Sykes & Jona Weinhofen]
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you

[Verse 2: Oli Sykes]

And for better or for worse, I was born into a hearse

Title: Seen It All Before
Release Date: April 1, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-seen-it-all-before-lyrics
Song Description: Seen It All Before talks about Olivers depression, he was so much time in a sad life and with negative thoughts, now hes tired of this.

In a track-by-track interview with MetalFuckingRocks, drummer Matt Nicholls explained:

It started out sounding like a really 90s, Euro thing that Jordan made. Ha ha ha! And it took all of us a bit of time to get used to the sound of it, but now that its all mixed and stuff, it sounds amazing. When you strip it all back, that 90s Euro sound is still there, ha ha ha!

Vocalist Oli Sykes also added:

This is definitely the most poppy song on the album.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the déjà vu
We've seen it all before
I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before

[Verse]
Are we close enough?
There is something I must confide
I think we've lost our touch
There's no sparkle in those eyes
What an awful mess I've made
There's nothing left to say

[Chorus]
Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the déjà vu
We've seen it all before
I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before

[Chorus]
Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the déjà vu
We've seen it all before
I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before

[Outro]
I'm sorry, love, it's not enough
We shouldn't feel the love so painfully
It hurts right to the touch
I know it stings, I know this cuts
And I wish I could agree with you
But this love, it's not enough
(It's not enough, it's not enough)

Lyrics:

[Intro: BEXEY]
You know I got my granddad's pistol in that antique cabinet (Mm)
I be having more interesting conversations with it (Ah, ah)
Than those that are surrounding me
Babe (What?)
Take a shot (Are you talking to me?)
Bring Me The Horizon
Take a shot, yeah, take a shot (Me?)
Yeah, yeah, take a shot, yeah, take a shot

[Verse: BEXEY]
I got my granddaddy's motherfuckin' pistol (Yeah)
I let it sleep on the antique cabinet (I let it sleep)
I got a fist full of acid when I smack you in your face
LSD up in your brain, now you travelin'
Send me a postcard, gang of wolves like Mozart
Take a quick sip of the potion just to get the flow started up
He's a renegade, featherweight, call the demons, let 'em play
Burn, kick the door off the bitch like I'm Leatherface
Somebody bring me the horizon, this view is boring me (It's boring)
Kicked out of my own funeral for being drunk and disorderly
Talk to an angel with a tilted halo when I fall asleep (Whatcha say?)
Arguin' in the mirror like DeNiro, "You talking to me?" (Ah)
I'm the only one here (Yeah), I cannot hear what you're saying
I'm Van Gogh with one ear, Van Go, Van Hoff
Whatever floats your paper boat (Mm, mm, mm)
We all float down here, baby, just let it go
Yeah, I set the flow (Bah)

[Monologue: Oli Sykes]
Check, check
Yo, can you hear me? Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Imagine there's a candle in your point of reference
Look at the candle

[Instrumental Break]

[Monologue: Oli Sykes]
Tune in to the sound, don't think about anything else
Focus on the point, I said a candle, didn't I?
But I mean, like, well
Just imagine summat in your mind's eye
And look at it
And visualise it
And shit'll start to glow
The black'll start to glow
The black
The dark will start to glow
I'm serious, man
This is, it might seem cringe as fuck, but actually do it
Now
Focus
[Instrumental Break]

[Monologue: Oli Sykes]
I wanna say something
I wanna talk to you but I don't even know what to say
I feel like there's a truth that we all don't know
And I think we've been designed
To just do what we have—
I-I think we got more than five senses
I think we got more than five senses
But we're never gonna find out any of the senses
Because we're so fuckin' busy, so wrapped up
So caught up in what we are actually doing every single day
Like think when someone discovered fire
What the fuck would that have looked like? How?
So there's fire, right?
Do we reckon we've just discovered everything there is to discover?
Focus, focus

[Instrumental Break]

[Monologue: Oli Sykes]
The universe is full of surprises
It's just waitin' for us
Just waitin' for our wits to get sharper
Just waitin' for us to actually open
Mad as fuck when you think about it
Because it don't make sense, does it?
I might sound like a proper idiot, but, like
Try and figure out how anything actually works
How-how we got here don't make any sense, so
It's not going
There's no way
It's a little bit scarier
Feel like, a little bit like something that pops off
I'm just tired, I guess
Focus, focus
Focus, focus on whatever you want
Whatever you want you can have
'Cause I was literally the biggest loser in the world
ADHD, I had no friends
I literally, literally, I'm not even saying that like, like a cliche thing
I had literally no one to-, would hang out with me
My friends used to just tell me one time it would stop
Mates used to nick all my money off me
All my video games, that shit, PlayStation, TVs and shit
And I got bullied to fuck
My life was shit
And I have no idea how I managed to do something
Where I actually get to do things that I like
And live a life where I'm happy
But I know it wasn't from school
I didn't learn fuckin' shit from school, I don't know anything
I don't know anything about geography
I don't know anything about motherfuckin' French
I know fuck all, to be honest, I'm a dipshit
French
All I know is
I don't even fucking know sometimes
That sounds cheesy as shit to say "Follow your dreams"
'Cause I don't even know if that's what I did
I just literally saw Daryl Palumbo on a video
Screamin' his tits off, and that looked like fun
And I wanted to do that as a job
I thought that would be cool
And I don't have any musical skills, I can't sing
I mean I can sing now kind of, but, you know
We use Autotune and shit
And I can't sing well, I just have passion and lyrics
And I just beg and I borrow and I steal and rip people off
You know, like, you got
Like, like, uh, "nihilist blues", that melody
Someone said, "Oh, that's like Evanescence"
I'm like, "Yeah, must have been"
Must have, we fuckin' subconsciously ripped it off
It's not like, I'm like not a fucking genius whatsoever
Just gettin' on and feel stuff and vibe
And that's mad, innit? In't that mad that I get to do what I want to do?
And so many, so, so many people have such fucking shit lives
That sucks so much, it breaks my heart so much
Because fuckin' I don't know
Like, every, we just look at things
'Cause we're human, we think that
How do I say this without people gettin' pissed off at me or angry?
Like, humans are all aligned, but you can tell
If you look at any other creature's eyes
It's, we're all here, we all feel, we're all scared
We all got that fuckin' feeling in our stomachs that make us wanna kill ourselves
It's always too much
And it's so fuckin' unfair that there's people at the top
And people at the bottom
And there's, there's animals at the bottom
And there's animals that get grinded into fucking shit
And there's slaves and just like, just
I mean I'm guilty, I'm a fuckin'
Like, I ain't a saint, but I love everyone and everything so much
I really, honestly do
Like I want, I just, I want the best for all
'Cause what if it's like, it sounds mad as fuck
But people believe in God, don't they?
And people believe in people looking down on us and shit like that
So it's not that mad to think that what if this is a classroom?
Teacher room?
What if people are watching us?
What if something bigger is there looking down on us?
And seeing how we do
And seeing if we're good enough for the next stage?
'Cause we need to be better
I need to get better, I need to be a better person
We all need to be better people
It's not about what tastes good or what feels good or how cool you look
Or who likes you and shit
We need to like fucking come together, it's maddening
It's all cliche shit, it just sounds like such bollocks
But we need to fuckin' do this
We're literally at the end, doesn't it feel like that to you?
It feels like it to me
Feels like we're at the end of everything
And it feels like it's gonna be like some fuckin' massive volcano
Or eruption or fuckin' tsunami will happen
You know what that's what, that's what's gonna happen?
Some fuckin' mental disaster in a couple of years
Like mental, mental, mental disaster
Whether it's natural or whatever
And then everyone's gonna go fuckin', "Oh, right, we need to sort it out now
We need to do something about this now"
But, but we fuckin' need to do something
But we need to do it now
And why not?
It's not that bad, eatin' like
Yeah, all right, we get it, meat tastes good
And, come on, man, they're alive
These things are living, they're living creatures
Like, what the fuck? We don't need it
Do you need it?
No, and I'm not, I'm a hypocrite
'Cause I've got all this shit I don't need too
But like, I think we all need to start thinkin' about what we actually really fuckin' want
If you really fuckin' want something, you can have it
Have it, sure, but end of the day, if you, like if
You want something so bad that it's worth someone else's pain and suffering
I don't fuckin' think you do
Focus
Focus on what you want
I'm serious, I'm gonna stop talking now
Focus
Are you recording?
Yeah, it's all good4Embed

Our legs begin to break, we've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache, but still, we carry on
I'm chokin' on my words like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this, I can't believe it's got to this
And dear, I fear that this ship is sinkin' tonight

[Chorus: Oli Sykes, Sam Carter, Oli Sykes & Sam Carter]

And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself

Our legs begin to break, we've walked this path for far too long

I'm not comin' home tonight, I'm not comin' home tonight
'Cause, dear, I fear, oh, dear, I fear
I'm not comin' home tonight, I'm not comin' home tonight

Title: Alligator Blood
Release Date: October 27, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-alligator-blood-lyrics
Song Description: The seventh track from There is a Hell, Alligator Blood comes in as one of the heavier tracks on the album. The style is reminiscent of their work on their previous album, Suicide Season.

The title of the song comes from a poker term for a player that has no concern for his competition, and is ruthless in taking other players' money. Conversely, someone with alligator blood is one that, when losing, barely stays in the game. Within the context of the song, the player of Russian roulette is not concerned with the outcome of the game, as long as he lives, and survives each round by the skin of his teeth.
Lyrics:

[Refrain]
Let's play a game of Russian Roulette
I'll load the gun, you place the bets
Tell me who will make it out alive
Let's play a game of Russian Roulette
I'll load the gun, you place the bets
Tell me who will make it out alive

[Verse 1]
Over and over and over again, we play the same old games
Cards kept close to my chest, that way the secret's kept
So wear your poker face, here's to the fool, here's to the thief
Fiction is bitter and you got a taste

[Chorus]
My alligator blood is starting to show
I know that you know that, I know that you know
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand
My alligator blood is starting to show
I know that you know that, I know that you know
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand

[Verse 2]
Cut me up and wear my skin, show me how to live
Tear me down, clean me up, now spill my fucking guts
Just help me find a way, just help me find a way
Just help me find a way, just help me find a way

[Post-Chorus]
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls

Now you know, you can go, you can give up trying

Dead hands clutch my arm, the smell of death fills the air
Her fragrance, a carcass reanimates
Oh, if you need me, I'll be tying a rope to the tree
Where our, where our love used to be
I took down every photo of us and buried them at sea
I took down every photo and I buried them at sea
Don't worry, pretty, beauty is only skin deep
(Psyche!)

[Chorus]
Your beauty is no more
So why don't you just fuck yourself, you fucking whore
Oh, your beauty is no, no more
So why don't you just fuck yourself, you stupid fucking whore

Lyrics:

I've dug my grave so I'll die in it

[Pre Chorus]

(Clenched teeth and fluttering eyes)
(Can't go on like this)
Tell all my friends, I said goodbye
Clenched teeth and fluttering eyes

I'm knocking on Death's door, but you're already dead
It's either now or fucking never

All I can say for sure is

Title: ​fresh bruises
Release Date: January 25, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-fresh-bruises-lyrics
Song Description: Third interlude of the album, fresh bruises is yet another electronic infused record. With an eerie and bass-heavy instrumental. Oliver demands to his lover a few things that he wants in his relationship, avoiding to get hurt once more. fresh bruises also samples the opening intro of Can You Feel My Heart in the verse.

https://youtu.be/MLtPdXR-eFw

Oliver talked to Apple Music going further in depth about the song:

This was a very organic song, it came very naturally. It was one we just wanted to makea song that wasnt verse, chorus, verse, chorus, but more of an electronic vibe. The kind of music I listen to is like that, centered around a hook, and it has a drop and it has a buildup. Not in an EDM sense, but more like lo-fi electronic, avant-garde. It just felt cool to make something more jammy and free like that.

You've got a mouth like a razor-blade, it cuts so deep
So kiss my wrists and my neck, give me eternal sleep

You say, you say, "I'm only a phone call away"
But for me, this distance is decay

I'll gurgle the blood under a sea of lies
Before you take me to sea, let me kiss the bride
Before you take me to sea, let me kiss the bride

Lyrics:

The minutes are hours, the hours are days

I smell the lies dancing on your blackened lungs

[Chorus]
I whispered in her ear, "Fear me, dear, for I am Death"
I'll take your hope, your dreams, your love till there's nothing left
I whispered in her ear, "You better fear me, dear, for I am Death"
I'll take that shit you call a life in a single fucking breath

[Post-Chorus]
I'll take your hope, I'll take your fucking dreams
I'll take your love, I'll take everything, you fucking bitch

[Breakdown]
I'll steal the diamonds from your eyes
I'll turn your promises into lies
I'll steal the diamonds from your eyes
I'll turn your promises into lies

One of my favorite things in the world ever
Dreams and dreaming
I want you to ask yourself this question
When you dream, do you dream only in black and white?
Or do you dream in color?
It's interesting because everyone is different
When I dream, I always dream in color
Some people only dream in black and white
And are you yourself in the dream?
Or do you see or watch yourself in the dream?
We'll do a little survey and find out
From answers all around the world
What happens when you dream?

Title: Blacklist
Release Date: October 4, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-blacklist-lyrics
Song Description: Blacklist is the ninth track on Bring Me The Horizons third album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me Ive Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Lets Keep It a Secret.



Blacklist was aimed at former band member Curtis Ward who was fired during the touring cycle of Suicide Season. According to the band, Curtis had little input on the previous album, picked fights with everyone on stage and in the crowd, and only saw BMTH monetary gain.

Eventually, we all got drunk one night, and then shit hit the fan. We all had a big argument and, the next day, us all got together and had a talk and decided to kick him out. And the thing is he didnt even cry; he just sat there and took it because he didnt care. Like we were saying, he didnt give a fuck, his heart werent in it so I guess, in the end, we did him a favour. He wanted to go. He wanted to be with his girlfriend and just why dont you just go and fucking do it, just do it, see ya later.
 Matt Nicholls

In 2014, the band severed tensions with Curtis and invited him on stage to play Pray For Plagues at both the Underworld and the Wembley Arena.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
So just like that, you're fucking dead and gone
You can only wear a crown of thorns for so long
We built an empire and you took the throne
But you built it from bayonets and sat there alone

[Verse 1]
So just like that, you're fucking dead and gone
You can only wear a crown of thorns for so long
We built an empire and you took the throne
But you built it from bayonets and sat there alone
I hope your queen was worth it
Do you still serve her on your knees?
'Cause you sat when the world was at your feet
Just slept while we lived the dream

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't miss the water till the river runs dry
You won't miss the sunset till it burns out the sky
You won't miss what you have till it's finally lost
But you don't miss a bastard when you're bearing his fucking cross

[Chorus]
Blacklist, nothing but a blacklist
With friends like you, there's no need for enemies
With friends like you, there's no need for anything
Blacklist, you're nothing but a blacklist

Well, I know I was a cunt in the final days
It just filled me with venom, filled me with rage
To see someone not give a shit, despite of all of this

[Bridge]
I won't see you around, I couldn't give a fuck

Fuck you

You bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you could, now leave, like vultures

[Pre-Chorus]
Ripped apart in minutes what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back may as well have disappeared
For as long as I remember, you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, you're on your fucking own

[Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open because
Sleep with one eye open

[Bridge]

With the knife that you left in my back

Title: The Fox and the Wolf
Release Date: October 4, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-the-fox-and-the-wolf-lyrics
Song Description: The Fox and the Wolf is the final track on Bring Me The Horizons third album, There is a hell, believe me Ive seen it. There is a heaven, lets keep it a secret.. The song features guest vocals from The Chariots front man Josh Scogin.



Lyrically, The Fox and the Wolf is a fierce warning against hard drugs.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Oliver Sykes]
You said you can't get to heaven unless you get high
But there's no word of hell on the way back down
You said it's now or never, you only live once
Would you be so quick to walk over my grave?
You said you'll never be younger than you are tonight
Now I've never felt weaker in all of my life
You said it's only a one-off, only a line
But now it's a circle all of the time

[Verse 2: Josh Scogin]
Well, it's a one-man cult, and he's serving his line
It's a "Lust for Life", but it's a lifeless wine
He kissed her hand, and then he found out her name
It's Death, and now he can't seem to wake
Can't run with the foxes and yet hunt with the wolf
Can't run with the foxes and yet hunt with the wolf

[Bridge: Oliver Sykes, Josh Scogin, Oliver Sykes & Jona Weinhofen]
Tell me the truth, are you addicted?
Tell me the truth, are you addicted?
Tell me the truth

[Chorus: Oliver Sykes, Oli Sykes & Josh Scogin]
I think I'm losing my mind, I think I'm losing my mind
They say the poison's in the dosage, and they must be right
Left with panic attacks and death riding our backs
It all looks so much worse on the way back down
I think I'm losing my mind, I think I'm losing my mind
They say the poison's in the dosage, and they must be right
Left with panic attacks and death riding our backs
It all looks so much worse on the way back down

Title: Home Sweet Hole
Release Date: October 4, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-home-sweet-hole-lyrics
Song Description: Home Sweet Hole deals with addiction and very likely its about Olis addiction to ketamine, which he admitted at APMAS:

I wanna say something that I never thought Id actually talk about. Before we wrote Sempiternal I was a fucking drug addict. I was addicted to a drug called ketamine; I was on it for years and I was fucked off my head. My band wanted to kill me, my parents wanted to kill me, my fucking brother wanted to kill me. Everyone wanted to kill me, everybody wanted to fucking take me to hell, but they didnt. They stood by me. They supported me through all of that shit and we wrote Sempiternal because of it. And no one fucking knows this! No one fucking knows this, but I went to rehab for a month, and through that time, as well as my fucking band and my family, you guys  you had no fucking idea that I was in rehab  but you were sending me letters, you were sending me texts, you were sending me fucking emails. When I got out of that rehab I didnt want to fucking scream anymore, I wanted to sing it from the fuckin' rooftops. And its all thanks to you, so thank you very much.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Oli Sykes]
Cross my heart, I don't wanna die
But heaven knows it seems like I try
Lost in a labyrinth for weeks on end
I live and I learn from my mistakes, then forget them again
Got a feelin' in my stomach and it just won't quit
It's subtle as a shotgun and heavy as a brick
'Cause I'm staring at the devil and the truth of it is
He's a lot more familiar than I'd care to admit
If only I could focus, maybe if I could see
If I didn't know any better, I would say he looks just like me

[Pre-Chorus: Oli Sykes]
The roof is crashin' down, the walls are cavin' in
We discover all your stories are just works of fiction
The roof is crashin' down, the truth is spillin' out

And everyone went dancing on this truck?

That sounds good
Could you help me? You'll get candy

Title: Don’t Look Down
Release Date: October 30, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-dont-look-down-lyrics
Song Description: Created for Zane Lowes re-score of Drive, Dont Look Down was released on the bands SoundCloud on October 29th, 2014.

The songs overall message is that drugs take control of your life. The devil that the song frequently talks about is a metaphor for drug.

The song was created in partnership with Orifice Vulgatron and, as a result, sounds nothing like a typical BMTH song, instead. The jungle rhythm is influenced by Vulgatron, whereas the screaming and guitar riffs are Sykes' input. The band has stated that this was only made because none of their previous work would fit in the Drive re-score. They also wanted to experiment.

We appreciate the level of passion both good and bad for DLD. We are really proud of what we created, but at the same time, we understand peoples confusion and panic after hearing the track. We were approached by Radio 1 to score a piece of music for a rescore of the movie Drive. Now if youve seen Drive Im sure you will agree neither anything from our previous albums, nor drown would of [sic] fit very well with the vibe of that particular movie, so we decided to create a piece of music that did justice to the amazing scene we were given. we took the opportunity to make something completely different, to do something completely different, something that we wouldnt usually do- although I feel that doesnt really make sense anymore, because we never do the same thing 2x. We experiment, we change it up, We take risks because we dont want to stay the same and we want to breathe life into this lackluster genre, and we want to keep you guessing whats coming next. Big up Orifice Vulgatron of Foreign Beggars for collaborating on the track, And once again, if you can tune into BBC 3 tonight at 10 and watch the whole movie, its an amazing project, and we think we smashed our part, and hope you guys feel the same once youve seen it. Peace, BMTH

I guess when we left each other for the first time
We didn't think "Goodbye" would be our new favourite lineEmbed

Lyrics:

[01BMTH8]

I know my heart won't go
My heart won't live this time

[02BMTH8]

I don't wanna hate, but I'm staring down the face
The grass was never greener, it was all a deep fake

[03BMTH8]

I scare myself, I scare myself
I scare myself, I scare myself, oh no, sometimes
I scare myself

[04BMTH8]

You know it's sad but true
How you use me to keep the dark out
And the devil at bay
But I can't keep you safe
I refuse to heal your bruises
'Cause I keep giving in and
And you just take, I'm done with being [?]

I can be your lover
I can be your ghost
Radiate

I think we are doing some mad shit to earth

And [?] of the stars
No, there's nowhere left to hide

[06BMTH8]

I'm a fuckin moron
I hate myself right now

[10BMTH8]

Death
Death

Jump jump jump jump ju-ju-ju-yeah

Pass the flask, 'cause I'm bathing in blood
Will be the ones in your stomach as you march towards your death
And the demons keep flirting with me but it’s fun


[05BMTHS2]

Please tell me why
With a foot in the grave
Don't tell me what I'm missin'
I've been using again

Please tell me why
I wanna jump off a bridge
And go sleep with the fish

Please tell me why
I wanna burn everything

[06BMTHS2]

I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?

[09BMTHS2]
Remember the lockdown
The world is not safe anymore
Remember this moment
NEVEREmbed

Title: 3;33 [WHY YOU WANNA LET GO?]*
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-3-33-why-you-wanna-let-go-lyrics
Song Description: 3;33 [WHY YOU WANNA LET GO?]* is a fan-made working title for an unreleased song by Bring Me the Horizon.

On March 18th, 2020 Oliver Sykes went on Instagram Live and teased the song with the camera focused on a stylized picture that shows the numbers 3;33 surrounded by stars.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Why you wanna let go and ruin my life, ruin my life?
You don't know, you don't know why, you're living a lie
Don't you feel anything for me, go ahead and leave me here to bleed
I'm ruining my life, I'm ruining my life, ruining my life

[Chorus]
Why you wanna let go and ruin my life, ruin my life?
You don't know, you don't know why, you're living a lie
Don't you feel anything for me, go ahead and leave me here to bleed
I'm ruining my life, I'm ruining my life, ruining my life
You don't know, you don't know why, you're living a lie
Don't you feel anything for me, go ahead and leave me here to bleed
I'm ruining my life, I'm ruining my life, ruining my lifeYou might also likeEmbed

Title: [ost] dreamseeker
Release Date: May 24, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Bring-me-the-horizon-ost-dreamseeker-annotated
Song Description: Not 100% sure, but this might be about how Oli used to frequently get sleep paralysis and how his wife Alissa used to wake him up. He said in an interview (I forgot which one) that if Oli experienced paralysis hed breathe loudly and wake his wife up, who in return would wake Oli up.

Another possibility is it might be related to LosT. You can hear the heart beating, multiple voices, and almost the feeling of impending doom which can be related to brain surgeries, the same ones that Oli undergoes in the LosT music video. You can also briefly hear someone say the word injection, and administer, which can be correlated to a needle injection.

PROPOSED SUGGESTION: This could also be the Church of Genxsis initiating the YOUtopia experiment. Its possible to hear some parts of the [ost] (spi)ritual lyrics in this introduction, which connects the two songs (and, by extension, n/A, LosT, and sTraNgeRs)
Lyrics:

[Spoken]

On my right hand

On my right hand
Injection administered [?]
Restrictions lifted
Overclock initialising, testing dreamseeker address and system response

Song Description: A Lot Like Vegas is the fourth song from Bring Me The Horizons debut album Count Your Blessings, released on 30th October 2006. It talks about a relationship that is a lot like Las Vegas.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
So cash in all your chips tonight, baby
'Cause we're going out of style
We could leave this city
If only for a while

[Chorus]
We'll take this feeling to our graves
For every heart we betrayed
No one can know about this
We'll take this feeling to our graves
For every heart we betrayed
No one can know about this

[Interlude]
The only place I'll call home is my deathbed

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I know we're so wrong, but it feels so right
It's not a party if it happens every night
I'm running on empty, you're running out of luck
So let's ditch this city before we sober upYou might also like1Embed
