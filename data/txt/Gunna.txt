Artist: Gunna, Alternate Names: Wunna, Gunna Wunna, YSL Gunna, Sergio Giavanni Kitchens, Sergio Kitchens
Artist Description: Sergio Giavanni Kitchens (born June 14, 1993), better known by his stage name Gunna, is an American rapper from College Park, Georgia. Known for his melodic flows, he was introduced to  Young Thug through friend, and mentor, Keith Troup and subsequently signed to Thug’s record label, Young Stoner Life Records.

Gunna dropped his debut mixtape Drip Season in October of 2016. He released Drip Season 2 the following year and began 2018 on a high note with Drip Season 3,  which peaked at #55 on the Billboard 200.

In October of 2018, Gunna released Drip Harder, a collaborative mixtape with Lil Baby. The two continue to work together frequently and have showcased their chemistry on tracks such as Gunna’s “Sold Out Dates“ and “Oh Okay.“ Drip Harder’s hit track and lead single, “Drip Too Hard,“ peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Gunna followed up on the success of Drip Harder with his debut studio album, Drip or Drown 2, in February of 2019. His sophomore album, WUNNA dropped in May of 2020 and peaked as the top album on the Billboard 200. Following this success, Gunna dropped the fourth and final installment of his Drip Season mixtape series in 2022 with the release of DS4EVER.

Just months after Gunna’s second chart-topping album, DS4EVER, Gunna, and Young Thug, among twenty-six other people and affiliates of the Young Stoner Life label were arrested and charged with a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) charge with a fifty-six count indictment. It was claimed that Young Stoner Life (YSL) is a criminal street gang run by Young Thug; however, Gunna was only charged for representing the brand name. Both Atlantic Records and 300 Entertainment stood by YSL’s side as prosecutors announced that they will be using the artists' lyrics in the case.

Following Gunna’s December 2022 release from jail, in June 2023, he released his fourth studio album, a Gift & a Curse which included his hit single, “fukumean” — the track is Gunna’s highest peaking solo song and was the first track following Steve Lacy’s June 2022, “Bad Habit” to spend over three weeks atop the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart.

Lyrics:

[Intro: Gunna]
Yeah, yeah
Young, young, young Gunna, yeah
Run that back, Turbo
Baby

[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold-out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I light up Blu-rays
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

[Verse 1: Gunna]
'Nother backend, I'm back on the road
Flooded Patek, paid off a show
Drippin' is rare, more this Vlone
Hoes by the pair, I'm never alone
Sleep on the Lear, Comme des Garçons
Drop eight in a two and let it dissolve
Balmain my denim, young GunWunna ball
Rock the whole concert and hopped in a frog
My foreign's a toy, I'm still a kid
10K this year for Coachella, it's lit
Rolls got umbrellas to cover her wig
Open Ceremony, left them in a trench
Lightning bolt diamonds 'cause I want revenge
We straight like a line, man, I really got rich
Some more fancy yellow diamonds in my piss
Don't get it confused, I'm still bangin' the six
New Cartier, Gunna a don
Niggas tryna soak up the drip like a sponge
Hatred's contagious, I keep me a gun
I'm focused on makin' a M in a month
Baby order twenty thousand in ones
Walk in and buy, I'm not asking how much
Red on the bottom, you need to catch up
Consistently droppin', I need me a dub

I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Me and young Gunna back at it again
We just left New York, double datin' with twins
I just bought a Wraith, I retired the Benz
I fired my bitch and I hired her friend
I see all the hate through these Cartier lens
Every two months tryna put up an M
My dog caught a body, they got it on film
He still rockin' Gucci watches in the pen
Take a trip 'round the globe then we do it again
Got 'em watchin' my drip, guess I'm settin' the trend
Louis backpack, hit the jet and I'm gone
I don't post what I do 'cause these niggas be clones
See these diamonds they hittin', these VVS stones
Got a championship ring, I just brought it home
FN is plastic, them bullets like pellets
This Givenchy jacket, this ain't Pelle Pelle
Sold out dates, you know I don't play
The last eight months straight, got no time for breaks
On they neck 'til it breaks, ain't pushin' no brakes
I got on two watches, I still come in late
It feel like my birthday, I'm gettin' this cake
I pop like I got it, I'm holdin' my weight
I control the projects, I'm pushin' this weight
I'm sippin' this sizzurp, I poured me an eight
[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold-out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I light up Blu-rays

Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid

Title: P power
Release Date: January 13, 2022, URL: https://genius.com/Gunna-p-power-lyrics
Song Description: P power, originally titled pussy power, is an erotic ode to the irresistible sexual power that women hold. Over syrupy, explicitly sensual production that distinctly features women moaning, Gunna and Drake detail their drug-fueled sexcapades with women, and Drake also takes time to address his gang involvement.

The original version of this track samples the single version of Donna Summers 1976 record, Could It Be Magic. However, the sample did not appear on the final version of P power. Issues with the samples clearance were likely why the song was delayed and not released with the standard version of DS4EVER on its set release date of January 7, 2022.

The track was first previewed in a later-deleted post on Gunnas Instagram on November 2, 2021. It was then announced to have a Drake feature with the release of the DS4EVER tracklist. Prior to its release with DRIP SEASON 4EVER, the full original song containing the Donna Summer sample leaked on January 8, 2022, a day after DS4EVER was released.

Besides the tint, the curtain in the way
I had to sprint all way to the end
I lost some old friends, couldn't keep up the pace
Copped the new Lam' and put it on land
These fuck niggas mad, I see it in they face
The jet that I'm on, it's sponsored by Wraith
I'm dodging the rain and I'm dodging the hate
I don't need a pass 'cause I'm not in school
You playin', you gon' be another cold case
My diamonds gon' dance, they come and enhance
My dick in her hand, I bet it get ate

But I never want the key to the heart, nah

And love it when I'm rappin' with a guitar
We really came from the A
My shit flowin', havin' plenty of bars
[Chorus: Young Thug & Gunna]

Title: ​bread & butter
Release Date: June 2, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Gunna-bread-and-butter-lyrics
Song Description: bread & butter marks Gunnas first release following his December 2022 release after he plead guilty to one count of racketeering charges.

Throughout the track, Gunna speaks on several people in the rap industry such as Young Thug, Lil Durk, Lil Baby, and Pierre P Thomas, the founder of Quality Control Music.

Gunna tackled the public response following his taking a plea deal in the YSL RICO case where several rappers decided to distance themselves from the Atlanta rapper in order to maintain their solidity towards Young Thug and YSL.

Rapping in a slow and smooth cadence over a guitar beat, Gunna also claimed he was tricked by the district attorney into taking the plea and that it was by mistake.

The official music video directed by LEFF sees Gunna in a black-and-white setting  possibly referring to a deeper meaning behind it as a black-and-white situation one where things are easy to decide right and wrong. This can play into the tracks title as ones bread and butter is a phrase to refer to ones source of income, suggesting that due to taking a plea, the industry is attempting to make it harder for him to earn a livelihood.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Goin' all out when it's 'bout that bread and butter
They'll kill for clout, I put that on my dead brother, yeah
He talk so much, I showed him I'm a real hunter
Won't say it, but he know I still got real cutters, yeah
Yeah, I'm right back and I lost mad commas
I had been down bad inside a dark tunnel, yeah
Fuck them boys, I found out who my real partners
And who was only with me 'cause I had dollars

[Verse 1]
Never fucked a nigga, always stayed solid
Kept it real with niggas, never lied and always stay honest
Love my bro so much, I'd never change on 'em
I'm the one to go and do the work, bring you thе damn profits
Hustled on my own, I always did know how to sell product
Nigga ain't gave mе shit, I grind so long, came from the damn bottom
Every nigga speakin' on my name could have some real problems
We are not the same, they ain't in my lane, I got my own column, yeah
Peepin' shit, I'm seein' niggas fall back
You bitch-ass niggas got me as the topic of the chat
You switched on me when you know you in business with a rat
And the boy that's like your brother, ain't nobody speak on that
The city see it clearly if I had to state a fact
You still fuck with a nigga that done got yo' partner ****
Heard these niggas talkin', only knew 'em 'cause of Slatt
These rap boys need more streams, heard he put my name on wax
You wouldn't even believe, I ain't had to watch my back
It's niggas really talkin', how you think we done got snatched?
Nobody sent the kite, I sent it wrong way, didn't get it back
This shit done got off track, let's get it back on track

Fuck them boys, I found out who my real partners
And who was only with me 'cause I had dollars, yeah

[Verse 2]
Fuck I paid the lawyers all them mills for?
Just so I won't have to say a word to dodge a railroad
Niggas find it hard to understand, though
Dawg ain't put me down, I been locked down, I don't know which way to go
Never gave no statement or agree to take no stand on 'em
On whatever you niggas on and trust me, I'ma stand on it
Lawyers and the DA did some sneaky shit, I fell for it
On my Ps and Qs because this time, I be prepared for it, yeah
'Posed to shine, these niggas throwin' shade, though
I can get him hit, but I'ma just chill and just see how it go
Buddy say he want some smoke with me, ain't in my time zone
Any given day, I could just pop out one of them side doors
Gunna, he too slick, you ain't gon' know which way I play it
Shit too hot, I can't even put no money on—
Pullin' up, pop out, like, "What the fuck you niggas said?"
Ain't with all that talkin', this the last time I'ma say it, yeah
Probably think I'm sick, the way I keep poppin' these meds
I finally found out that's just the way the devil dance
Had too many niggas 'round I fed that bit my hand
I got too many folks to feed, you just don't understand, yeah
[Chorus]
Goin' all out when it's 'bout that bread and butter
They'll kill for clout, I put that on my dead brother, yeah
He talk so much, I showed him I'm a real hunter
Won't say it, but he know I still got real cutters, yeah
Yeah, I'm right back and I lost mad commas
I had been down bad inside a dark tunnel, yeah
Fuck them boys, I found out who my real partners
And who was only with me 'cause I had dollars, yeah (Yeah)5Embed

Title: Car Sick
Release Date: February 2, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Gunna-car-sick-lyrics
Song Description: Car Sick sees Gunna teaming up with NAV and Metro Boomin.
The featured artists both produced this track and is one of the standout tracks from Drip Season 3.

This track details the rich rapper lifestyle of Gunna and NAV. Most of their lines can be interpreted as a celebration to obtaining expensive clothing, jewelry or drip, but they both also drop retrospective bars about the envy that they arouse.

Gunna and NAVs first verses go back-to-back, which in musical terms, is called a verse-to-verse flow. The chorus is split in half with NAV rapping the first half and Gunna rapping the second half.

Had too many flaws, I got my Rolex studded with flawless (Flawless)
Had too much drip, I had to invest into a closet (Closet)
When I poured that 12 inside of a 2, I felt nauseous (Nauseous)
If I pop another Tesla pill, I'ma be car sick (Car sick)

[Verse 4: NAV]
I spend a mortgage on my clothes, now I'm ballin' (I'm ballin')
Girl, I'm tryna fuck right now, no time for stallin' (Stallin')
I just got a walk-in closet to put the mall in (Mall in)
My whip so close to the floor, you gotta fall in (It's foreign)
I stopped wearin' Levi's, now it's Balmains (Balmain)
Every time you see me, I'm with the same gang (Same gang)
I'm tryna get a hundred mill', fuck tryna maintain (Maintain)
Pour me up another six, I'm killin' all pain (Killin' all pain)

[Chorus: NAV & Gunna]
I was born with all this drip, I came out a faucet (Drip)
When they put my bro in a chain gang, I almost lost it (Almost lost it)
So much jealousy and envy, gotta be cautious (Gotta be cautious)
I made some M's when I surrounded myself with bosses (Bosses)
Had too many flaws, I got my Rolex studded with flawless (Flawless)
Had too much drip, I had to invest into a closet (Closet)
When I poured that 12 inside of a 2, I felt nauseous (Nauseous)
If I pop another Tesla pill, I'ma be car sick (Car sick)

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Wheezy outta here
Huh, uh

[Chorus]
Who think you foolin'? We not new to it
We countin' fluent
Hawks game on the wood, my cup full of mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma give all my problems above
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love

[Verse 1]
We don't need no one vouchin' for us
I've been grindin' and found me a buzz
I've been searchin' for love and found lust
It's so hard to stop holdin' a grudge
My lil' dawg split your shit like a Dutch
My whole squad kept the kid in the cut
Keep your strap 'cause these niggas play tough
Pick and choose who the right one to trust
Pick and choose who the right one to trust
Keep it real, it's a lot of fake love
Niggas hate but they bitches in love
Paint the Bentley all white like a dove
I took off, ain't the same as it was
Kicked her out, told her walk to the bus
I'm a sipper, can tell when it's cut
You can't tell me that she ain't a slut

Who think you foolin'? We not new to it

Sometimes a gangsta need a hug

Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love

[Verse 2]
I don't need no one vouchin' for me
I be flossin', ain't talkin' 'bout my teeth
Car push-start, I keep losin' the keys
Chanel, Boss my closet full of C's
My shit wet Eliantte, VVs
I got pearls 'round my neck, not no beads
I get cash in my bag while I'm sleep
New blue face, two-tone Patek Philippe
Beverly Center, shoppin' spree on me
New agenda, don't do nothin' free
Ain't no one of my foreigns on E
All my bitches got expensive weave
I sip drank for my pain to get eased
I still talk to the Lord on my knees
Helpin' me take care all of my needs
And we take off the top for a breeze
[Chorus]
Who think you foolin'? We not new to it
We countin' fluent
Hawks game on the wood, my cup full of mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma give all my problems above
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love14Embed

Title: .223
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Gunna-223-lyrics
Song Description: This is a collaboration between Gunna and Lil Uzi Vert that leaked on August 10, 2018.

The original file that leaked listed only the people involved in making the song and the date it was recorded in the filename (GUNNA UZi Wheezy SHAANRUFF  4-29-18.mp3), which tells us that this is a Gunna song, featuring Lil Uzi Vert, produced by Wheezy, recorded/mixed by Shaan Singh on April 29, 2018, and a rough mix, not the final. .223 is the name fans gave the song after it leaked, because it was otherwise untitled.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Gunna]
I got flawless baguettes in that side of the charm
Expensive designer, ain't never been worn
Receivin' the prices, we sell out the dorm
Sky-Dweller watch cover half of my arm
Niggas ain't rockin the shit that we on
Your bitch came to see me like five in the morning
We carryin' these .223s like we the army
Hah, you niggas broke, don't think life is important
Headlining, we selling out like they Jordans
Cashing out numerous thousands in Barneys
You gon' swallow this cum 'fore you have an abortion
All the cars spaceships, we look like the martians
Stay in the box, can't go out of the margin
Coupe worth too much, valet can't even park it

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
This is a Bentley, bitch, this not a Lexus (Skrrt)
You beat me to the club like a domestic
I came to the club and they gave me a section (Vroom)
Hop in my truck and my truck all matte black
Saint Laurent trench coat, Rick Owens my jacket
Pull up, I Lam' it, no I won't crash it
Rockstar lifestyle like my name Lenny Kravitz
Cartier diamonds, the frame in my glasses
No, no, no, you can not get these lens crafters
I shook his hand I was smiling and laughing
We killed that nigga, came out like, “What happened?“ (What happened?)
What happened, lil nigga? What happened?
It's Mister Geeked-Up, I'm never not laughing
I stay with my twin like my name is Shannon
Blacken my fish, and no pink call it salmon (Yeah)

Title: TOP FLOOR
Release Date: May 22, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Gunna-top-floor-lyrics
Song Description: On TOP FLOOR, Gunna reunites with Travis Scott for a melodic track about their expensive lifestyles, specifically their clothing, cars, and jewelry.

The trumpet pattern on this track is reminiscent of the one on Young Thugs August 2019 track, Hot, which prominently features Gunna. Travis later featured on the official remix in October 2019. Both Hot and TOP FLOOR are produced by Wheezy, so this is somewhat a quasi-sequel.

On December 26, 2019, Travis and his DJ, Chase B, previewed TOP FLOOR while on Instagram Live. Its unknown if this was originally Travis song, but the live stream in which it was teased occurred a day before Travis and his record label, Cactus Jack, released their compilation project, JACKBOYS. Travis only debuted his verse and chorus, so Gunna likely added his contributions to the track at a later date.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Travis Scott]
(Run that back, Turbo)
(Wheezy outta here)
Jumped out of a wave right into a daze
It can wreck your life, you gotta think twice
Put it together, the color I like
Know it look better whenever enticed
Prada, blue leather, whatever her vice is

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
(Okay)
A mountain, ooh, ooh
Too toxic (Toxic), ooh, ooh
Wavy, not vibin' (Vibin'), ooh, ooh
I'm so surrounded ('Rounded), ooh
Yeah, let's go

[Verse 1: Gunna]
High in the sky, they can't reach (High)
Fly with a style that's unique (Fly)
Ride LaFerraris (Ferraris)
I came out the mud like the cleats
Float like Muhammad Ali (Yeah)
Wave, I was born in a sea (Wave)
Life of the party (Life of the party)
Miami, we had to star it (We had to star it)
I feed her, we eatin' calamari
Drip on these suckers, sorry, I'm not sorry
Order the PJ, I'm flyin' to Maui
One of one, only get VLONE from Bari (VLONE from Bari)
She came with me once, had a wonderful day
Bitch wrote a book and put me in her diary
We fucked on a boat, I'm a pirate (Pirate)
Admit it, I know you admire it (Admire it)
My diamonds dance like parade (Parade)
Matte black Aventador, same color shades (Shade)
Earn your promotion, I'll give you a raise (Raise)
Poured up some potion, feel intoxicated
Float like the ocean, young Gunna go crazy
Tropical bitches, her hair wet and wavy
Put a big double M on my Mercedes
Got me some millions, no minimum wagin'

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Top floor (Yeah)
Elevator entrance, not doors
Only thing above us is outdoors
Took her down to Houston to the chachos
Took a million and started a bank
Top of the floor, man, it came with the rank
And you're welcome come party, the hell did you think?
Juggle the beats how I juggle the fame
And I gobble the pain when I swallow this drank
I grow my own gas in the back of the farm
Need the cover of Time so my haters believers
I ran through these seasons with centerfold pieces
Flip the promoter just like we do pizza
Just run me my cheese, we don't wanna go grease ya
Hotline (Okay), turn the pipeline to a lifeline

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
A mountain, ooh, ooh
Too toxic (Toxic), ooh, ooh
Wavy, not vibin' (Vibin'), ooh, ooh
I'm so surrounded ('Rounded), ooh

[Intro]
It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
I drip on this bitch like Met Gala, ballin'
Answer her texts, don't answer her calls

[Chorus]
Yeah, she sent me a text, won't answer her call
She love when I flex and shop in the mall
Relieving her stress, I beat down her walls
Skeet-skeet on her chest, she kissin' my balls
We speed in that 'Vette, don't stop for the laws
VVs on my neck, I shine in the dark
It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
Walk in with the drip, that Met Gala Ball

[Verse 1]
Shoot your shit up, I got accurate aim
Fucked up a few mil', now I'm back like I came
That boy say my name, I went and got me some strain
You know I don't crash, I just stay in my lane
Please don't compare, because we not the same
GunWun ain't no gimmick, ain't clownin' for fame
I trapped for a living and been had a name
Work hard for these clothes, cars, and watches and chains
Oh, man, Rolls-Royce got umbrellas, this whip for the rain
These folks done fucked up, let me slip in the game
This bitch let me fuck, this shit went to her brain
She know I'm a beast, and ain't easy to tame
She squirt on my sheets while I beat out her frame
Dozed off, woke back up, she still sayin' my name
In love with my life, and you wish we could trade

Walk in with the drip like Met Gala Ball
Came in and she strip, her panties and all
Lip gloss on her lip, suck me like a Hall
A boss and a pimp, I bought me a ship
I walk with a limp, FN in my drawers
When she talk that shit, I put dick in her jaws
I hit and don't miss, ain't no win, lose, or draw
Hit and don't miss, ain't no win, lose, or draw
Came from Flat Shoals and Old Nat
On the South, in that back, you get whacked, then get shot in your car
Why hell you think that I'm maxin'? Relaxin' in mansions, no cappin', 'cause we had it hard
I ain't get this shit just from askin', I made this shit happen and passion, it played a big part
I ain't get this bitch off of mackin', it came off of actions and fashion and stay in accord

[Chorus]
Yeah, she sent me a text, won't answer her call

The song was first teased when the Turbo-produced instrumental was included in the album teaser on March 4, 2020. A snippet of the songs intro later appeared on April 15, before the song was fully leaked on May 14. It was officially released on May 18.

Release Date: May 22, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Gunna-nasty-girl-on-camera-lyrics
Song Description: NASTY GIRL / ON CAMERA is a thriller on WUNNA. The songs title can be read as one phrase, but its intentionally split because there are two distinctive parts. The first, NASTY GIRL, is about the various women that Gunna has sexually encountered in his career, as he discusses the many provocative acts that they engage in. This seamlessly transitions into ON CAMERA, where he furthers the sexual tropes while emphasizing that these women desire to be filmed while partaking in intimate activities.

Title: ​back to the moon
Release Date: June 16, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Gunna-back-to-the-moon-lyrics
Song Description: back to the moon sees Gunna speak to  those who dont support his own work, advising them not to judge his without having any of their own.

This track breaks in a Gift & a Curse, after its drumless introduction, with an immediate kick to his listeners ears, followed shortly by guitar strums. The amplification of quality is reflected by the title, as it includes to the moon with the previous title back at it in emphasis of how much higher the bar is raised for a Gift & a Curse.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
If you don't fuck with me, don't do what I do
Think he the one, but he really the two
Better get low when I hit at your crew
I'm sendin' the cleaners through
I'm barely not sober, they thinkin' it's over, you niggas ain't seen my move
They sat me down like I went outerspace, now I gotta go back to the moon

[Verse 1]
Nigga right back on the shrooms
Nigga geeked up like it ain't nun' to lose
Two months, I'm back on the move
Right back in the club throwin' racks in the pool
I'm 'bout to start actin' a fool
It's just you and me, and you know who I choose
You knew this would happen, you cut off the crew
I'm talkin' to me and not you
I missed out on millions and millions, that money is gone
Ain't get no compensation, ain't no conversation for niggas, we ready to roll
Let's get back to that basic, main reason they fakin' 'cause I done been fuckin' they hoes
Only reason you said it 'cause these niggas said it, you suckin' the dick and the toes

[Verse 2]
You get caught, gotta know how it go
'Cause this shit could get tricky fasho
Rich enough to get put in a hole
Got a crew but I been all alone
I been drivin' the car from the back takin' pictures and pieces in back of the Rolls
And I think these lil' boys wanna cook somethin', let's crank up the beef and get back to the shows
In Miami, we BP the boat
Put the bulletproof back on the road
Been a minute, it's been so long
Ever wondered that I was doin' wrong
I said, "Hold up, I'm switchin' up the tone"
Man, these niggas couldn't see me with the song
If these niggas done never see me, probably wouldn't even be rappin' all along
And Young Gunna didn't get a season, these niggas'll never put it on
I can't start back at where was needed
Yeah, I know y'all, Wun-Wunna put me on
Kept it cool but it got me heated
And I'm 'bout to show 'em how it go
Like a river, I show 'em how it flow
At the show, and they know my M-O

If you don't fuck with me, don't do what I do
Think he the one, but he really the two
Better get low when I hit at your crew
I'm sendin' the cleaners through
I'm barely not sober, they thinkin' it's over, you niggas ain't seen my move
They sent me down like I went outer space, now I gotta go back to the moon

[Verse 3]
Nigga, back over the trees
Niggas still rollin', we back on the east
I'm still havin' soldiers that handle the needs
The venegance is givin' them ease
You talkin' at rats and you all with that cheese, we havin' some lemon squeeze
I let your BM do whatever I please, you know she do good on her knees
I finally discovered the breeze
I'm glad I can see I'm the one they discussin'
It ain't 'bout that money, you got me disgusted
You like it, then he gotta love it
He hope I stood down just to get up and close to a nigga 'cause I'm up above it
My homie keep beggin' to clean up a couple of niggas, but ain't really budgin'
Gotta watch for the law, so I really can't talk to you niggas, but fuck it
I'm a real boss and I gotta be cautious 'cause niggas don't keep it a hunna
It ain't my fault that I had to fall out with you niggas, but fuck it
Ain't havin' time to be talkin', rest of them niggas, come see me in public
You can't be trustin', you gotta watch out for these people
This shit'll get ugly, and you can be lucky if you can look out for your people
When he ain't have nothin' and tried to make somethin', we lookin' through hay for a needle
When you ever fall down and your back hit the ground, better pray to the Gods you don't need 'em
[Chorus]
If you don't fuck with me, don't do what I do
Think he the one, but he really the two
Better get low when I hit at your crew
I'm sendin' the cleaners through
I'm barely not sober, they thinkin' it's over, you niggas ain't seen my move
They sent me down like I went outer space, now I gotta go back to the moonEmbed

[Intro]
(Wheezy outta here)

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I'm pushin’ P, that's my favorite alphabet
She let me do as I please, I'm an alpha male
When your lawyer paid off, you don’t have to tell
When you pay your own bills, you don't have to care
If they noses ain't broke, then they gotta smell
We just got a fresh load, it's a lot in here
That boy on his third strike, get him out of there
Rock 'em out the park
Maybach drive itself so I don't got to park
Upgrade my jewelry, my watch is up to par
We gon' hit the head and watch the body fall
I'm goin’ ghost, I ain’t taking no morе calls
That pussy pop, gotta give her her lil' ’plausе
I want his top, gave the brodie them a job
If I put it up, we forever livin' large
We'll be okay if we make it to tomorrow

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Twenty-five thousand for a jacket, wear it once
Niggas actin' like they gettin’ active, no, they don't
She ain't tryna let me get it crackin', go 'head on
Fast car cuttin' up in traffic, I'm one of those
We ain't nothin' like these other rappers, weirdo
You be tryna save her, she get active, hero
Me and Gunna goin' back to back, here it go

Fresh and I'm blessed, that's why I'm the drip god
Mama ain't stressing, I'm still goin' hard
Bought me two 'Vettes and two Maybachs, what's next?
My whole name worth a check on that gray and black card
Niggas send threats, but I get niggas stretched
You get whacked with that TEC, ain't no need to act hard
Only speak guapanese
AP on my wrist, ain't accepting apologies
So much Prada, you ain't gotta be proud of me
I'm a dog, ho, you don't gotta lie to me
Feel like Pookie, that money keep calling me
Came a long way from shoppin' at Dollar Tree
She keep swallowin', that's why I don't got a seed
Buy Celine and Chanel, girl, you got a C

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gunna]
Twenty-five thousand for a jacket, wear it once
Niggas actin' like they gettin' active, no, they don't
She ain't tryna let me get it crackin', go 'head on

We ain't nothin' like these other rappers, weirdo
You be tryna save her, she get active, hero
Me and Gunna goin' back to back, here it go
Twenty-five thousand for a jacket, wear it once
Niggas actin' like they get it crackin', no, they don't
She ain't tryna let me get it crackin', go 'head on

I just left the hospital, might need another liver
Kidney failures, I tell you this shit couldn't be no realer
My body and drugs too familiar so it's hard to clear my system
This shit get hard on a nigga, I hardly show my feelings
Look up to see stars, but I'm realizing God in the ceiling
I been getting high inconsistent, but you tryna show me different
Judging me for trying the whippets, I'm tired of the critics
But I can't cap, I ain't feel it, but this time I done did it
The doc' didn't care who thе richest, I need to be admitted

Wanna know why the reason on why I have my reasons?
Reason why they ain't tell me it was pneumonia season
These police won't never save us, that's why I run with heathens
God say you want me to say it, you gotta take it easy
I'm tryna stack it like layers and keep it extra cheesy
I had stepped back from these rappers, these niggas actin' greedy
I'm gon' say no, I don't owe you, don't care if you really need it
Sometimes you gotta show you ain't no ho, ain't talking 'bout no bob and weavin'
Niggas know I got love for PO and Debo, must I repeat it?
(Niggas know I got love for PO and Debo, must I repeat it?)
Wake up, hit the 'yo, spit a flow, say let's go, then I repeat it
Take a look at my bro and I know we gotta eat
You a rockstar lil' soldier, I hope you don't never leave me
Codeine all in your colon, you got that shit and squeeze
Fucked up, can't control it, you steady rollin' weed
Everyone said they told you and you ain't takin' heed

Put the cake in the rubber band, stuff in my pants, I can do the band dance
Thousand dollar Fear of God Vans, drip when I'm playing, just call me Raf stan
Of course they dig what I'm saying, another advance, smoking me a strong strand
Ice all on my watch, add it to the card, had to get the cars washed
Heated marble squares on the floor
The condo got a bar, cost me an Aventador
Yeah, punch in this shit to record
What the fuck are you waiting for?
Spot just got jammed on the North
Fifty bands to my lawyer for court
My spot just got jammed on the North
Fifty bands to my lawyer for court

I see you with it, I'm with it, my nigga, let's get it
Bankroll got hundreds and fifties
All too familiar, admit it, I'm truly committed
My palms consistently itching
Served out the kitchen, relentless, we chasing these benjis
Back to back Maybachs and Bentleys
Shows back to back, my coupe paid off commission

[Verse 2]
Runnin' the sea on my wave
New two door coupe came with leather and suede
Fuck with this bitch 'cause she goin' both ways
Too much of this shit, I'ma throw it in bags
Not fuckin' you bitches from back in the day
My condo is raised, they dig like a grave
Gettin' in my bag and my family amazed
Gettin' out the hood, that shit felt like a maze
Gettin' out the hood, that shit felt like a maze
Call me your dawg, hold me down to the grave

[Chorus]
I see you with it, I'm with it, my nigga, let's get it
Bankroll got hundreds and fifties
All too familiar, admit it, I'm truly committed
My palms consistently itching
Served out the kitchen, relentless, we chasing these benjis
Back to back Maybachs and Bentleys
Shows back to back, my coupe paid off commission3Embed

[Chorus]
If you outta sight, you outta mind
You gotta stack, you gotta grind
I'm statin' facts, these niggas lyin'
You can't relax and keep wastin' time
I want the racks, I gotta get mine
Stackin' it up, I work wit' a stride
I went from a deuce, turnt up to a nine
I sleep with the stars, I know I'ma shine

[Post-Chorus]
Same price as the rent, that's the cost for the kicks
I'm stackin' up racks just to make a hit list
My nigga El Chapo' will chop off ya wrist
Pull up wit' them choppas, I know I won't miss
Some niggas get locked up, and turned to a snitch
But I kept it solid and hard as a brick
Winked at your bitch, she want give me a kiss
Walked in that bit' I was drippin' like piss

[Verse 1]
Bought an AP, and took my wrist out of the pot
Pop a bottle of Aces, and pour that shit out
Put some diamonds and chandeliers all in the spot
How many racks does this young nigga got?
I flew to Dubai, I didn't go to DeVry
Hunnit racks to put the jet in the sky
Time is music, this the best you could buy
I'm drippin' bitches, niggas still think they still fly
I think I'm the flyest, I ain't got no stylist
I'm geeked up off Molly, I'm fucking on Cyrus​
I flew wit' a choppa, I might catch a body
'Cause I see these fake niggas through the Cavalli's
I got with my locs and we reunited
These niggas quote poems, and they bitches like it
I didn't turn a ho, when I got indicted
If I catch a case, then I gotta fight it
My nigga called shawty, he ride with the shottie
We pull up in 'Rari's, these niggas don't like us
Smoke weed and sip lean and get money, my vices
My frenemies poison and I know they sheisty
I pray to the lord and he know that I'm righteous
I need a reward 'cause they say I'm the nicest
Got too many bros, they gon' roll out the dices
I stay out the way 'cause niggas like mices

[Verse 2]
Put the dick in her mouth, and it's fuck what you say
Fuck the law, blow the police away
I blew a 50, 'cause I had a long day
When it come to money, I done came a long way
I fucked the bitch, but I can't go on a date
She sucked me loose, I put some nut on her face
Let her see the loft, she gotta fuck at my place
I'm steady bossin', bitch I'm havin' my way
Niggas in the trap, but can't get away
But I've been 'round the world, it feel like I'm tourin'
I’m livin' life, I swear I know your life borin'
Mama said don't stop, I gotta keep goin'
The house so big, the bedroom got an alarm
The necklace cost so much it came wit' a charm
The diamonds drippin' like the rain when it stormy
These niggas say that they lookin', well I'm finna' show 'em
So many acres it look like a farm
23 Million like I'm Michael Jordan
2 or 3 bitches, they wanna come join
Fuck all these bitches, I feel like a Don
I looked in the mirror, I know I'm the one
You ain't gonna shoot, but you carry a gun
Niggas act tough, don't want to bury your son
Had to stay down, stack them racks through the month

If you outta sight, you outta mind
You gotta stack, you gotta grind

Lyrics:

[Part I: "so far ahead"]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah (Taurus)
Yeah (Run it back, Turbo)

[Chorus]
We made it when it's all said
Through scars and tears, you know I had a hard head
Couldn't tell you when it started, yeah
It's dark here, you know you was so far ahead
You know you was so far ahead

[Verse 1]
I'm glad I make my own noise
Puttin' in that work, I done became a rich man, I was a poor boy
Stupid lit with rich friends, that coupe a grown toy
Come get it if you want it, boy
Did it with a voice
No remorse, glad I made that choice
Now we whippin' Rolls-Royce
They can't find another source
Yeah, no endorse
I think it's best they join forces
It's funny, ain't that somethin' that they said I wouldn't be nothin'?
Thought you'd reap the benefits, instead, it's repercussions
You ain't care or try to hear me speak, instead, you judgin'
I cried myself to sleep one night just thinkin' 'bout my cousin
They gave him life, they lost a life and both the families sufferin'
He down, but he ain't take a life, it's always a discussion
This money ain't gon' end, it feel the way, I show my loving
This money disappear, I got real friends that still gon' love me

Know you was so far ahead

[Verse 2]
Money in that bank, we been gettin' plenty
Let me pop my shit, uh, I could pop a wheelie
SVJ 'Ventador, top off on the 'Ghini
Pretty face on that beach, a topless bikini
We both like to get high and if I'm Bobby, she my Whitney
That G5 in the sky and I can land in any city
They told me, "Don't let up," and now I'm up, but you don't hear me
The world depend on us, you got my trust until infinity
So secured, I keep my FN tucked 'cause I got enemies
I'm just tryna remain rich as fuck and you know how that be
Gettin' it in back like when they used to get it like ten a key
Business man, got my business plan inside a Louis brief'

[Chorus]
We made it when it's all said
Through scars and tears, you know I had a hard head
Couldn't tell you when it started, yeah
It's dark here, you know you was so far ahead (Yeah)
You know you was so far ahead (Yeah)
Know you was so far ahead
[Part II: "empire"]

[Intro]
Found
Yeah, it's been found
Yeah, yeah, found
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You ain't think we'd get the cream
Uh, now we livin' out our dreams
And the whole world ours
Lot of bosses in the team
We bust it down, don't need degree
Tryna build an empire
I separate my wants and needs
I'm booked out way in Germany
And the prices gettin' higher
I'm peepin' all my frenemies
That lil' ho shit, it don't mean nothin' to me
All the hate, why you ain't tired?

[Verse 1]
Young Gunna got a preference, she eat that dick for breakfast
You see, I'm interested, I wanna fuck your best friend
I'm countin' up with profession and got good sense of direction
Free my niggas on that kiosk
Can't smile, why they pull that Bentley B out
Windows fishbowl, see in and see out
GT, not a Fiat
I'm serious just like T.I.​
Rose gold stones hittin' in the night, look like a neon
If players talkin' hoes, you know I'm catchin' shit like Deion
And I was broke, but I ain't goin' back
I thank the G-O-D I got all these racks
You call my phone too much at once, ain't gon' never hit back
Hopefully you get that business done, you gon' go lay on your back
I was born to win, Lord forgive me, might have to sin again
It's crazy, but you set a trend, a lot of niggas need a name
It's crazy, but you set a trend, I'm knockin', baby, let me in
I need an angel, not a friend
Protection that'll never end
[Chorus]
You ain't think we'd get the cream
Uh, now we livin' out our dreams
And the whole world ours
Lot of bosses in the team
We bust it down, don't need degree
Tryna build an empire
I separate my wants and needs
I'm booked out way in Germany
And the prices gettin' higher
I'm peepin' all my frenemies
That lil' ho shit, it don't mean nothin' to me
All the hate, why you ain't tired?

[Verse 2]
I always been official, I never did no knock off
I pulled up with the roof on and she told me, "Take the top off"
I'm tryna get my rocks off, she suck, don't want no socks off
Lil' mami got that lockjaw
She can't figure me out, I ain't no jigsaw
In the streets, I played for keeps and learned to lay low
Shootin' shit up like Halo
She stay in Beverly Hills, but the rest of her family in San Diego
One of the ones that keep it real 'til this day though6Embed

They kept on pokin’, they ain’t know they'd get the roguish me
I never knew one day that we’d agree to disagree
They got ho tendency, I don't want no sympathy

We havin' problems, ain't no tellin' how they gon' be solved
Miss solitude, I'm out of state and I ain't talkin' calls
In my own shoes, I'm on the move and I ain't break it off
Look at these dudes crossin' they fingers, hopin' that I fall

Heard you caught a hit, but that don't make you no killer (Uh)
Rich and I feel fit, look like I play for the Steelers (Uh)
Fans say when I rap, they hear the pain in my rhythm (Uh)
Keeping them far back until I know they agenda (Uh)
All these niggas capping like the man in the middle
They gon' mеntion Wunna cause the views'll bе bigger (Uh)
Ain't no way to explain the way you abusin' these Skittles (Uh)
If I knew the road, I would've rolled, the risk to rolling the dice (Uh)
It's insane inside my brain, I'm spittin' this pain on this mic (Uh)
Gotta ball like I'm Wilt Chamberlain, a hell of a price (Uh)

Ran through a whole dub, this round, I'm keeping it tight (Keeping it tight)
Praying more on my knees at night, I'm tryna get right (Get right)
Times it don't feel even, but I still gotta stride (Still gotta stride)
Living through the seasons 'til the day that we die

[Verse 2]
Can't nobody stop it, when you pop it, you pop it (Uh, pop it, you pop it)
Hoping that I flop, but I sold copies and copies (Uh)
Just hand in more boxes, giving range and more options (Range and more options, uh)

Post every single move I do so he can go viral (Uh)

Title: ​back at it
Release Date: June 16, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Gunna-back-at-it-lyrics
Song Description: back at it is the introduction of Gunnas full-length return to music, a Gift & a Curse. It follows his infamous Alford Plea in the YSL racketeering case that freed him from jail.

Gunna uses this track as an opportunity to address his life after being freed, returning to his usual activity. Amongst these activities includes smoking marijuana, which he compares to crack cocaine due to him being sober for over eight months. He contrasts his freedom with his incarceration, in which he felt trapped. This contrast blends well with the idea of a Gift & a Curse, juxtaposing triumphs with pains.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
It's deeper than rap and this life can get crazy

[Verse 1]
Off the porch and didn't know where to go (Where to go)
Cross the street with my dawg, yeah, the woe' (The woe')
Being me made it harder to grow
Still went up, got my feet off the floor (Off the floor)
Gunna Wunna been wavy (Gunna Wunna been wavy)
But I always been playing it low (Playing it low)
Gettin' that work on the daily (Getting work on the daily)
Got a M and went crazy (Got a M and went crazy)
Then I went, moved my mom out the shady
Went and bought a Mercedes (Mercedes)
Took a L, niggas thinking it's gravy
Niggas gotta be crazy (Gotta be crazy)
Popping out, they gon' see me in HD
Give a reason to hate me (Reason to hate me)
Me, your bitch and her friend, that's a cool three
I can give 'em three reasons to hate me
I care less that they talking, fearless, I pull off in a yacht like it don't even phase me (Phase me)
I been talking to my accountant a lot, tryna make what I got stack tall like KD
Niggas talking 'bout who calling the shots, bitches calling my phone talking they want a baby
Shit get tragic, but we still make it happen, it's deeper than rap and this life'll get crazy

[Chorus]
All this money, I'm going crazy
All these bitches, I'm going crazy
Missed some millions, I'm going crazy
All these killers, I'm going crazy (Crazy)
It's deeper than rap and this life'll get crazy (Crazy)
It's deeper than rap and this life'll get crazy
Spending them racks, go crazy (Crazy)
Make it right back, that's crazy (That's crazy)
All these Benjamins, I'ma go crazy (That's crazy)
Getting it in, my numbers look crazy (Crazy)
It's deeper than rap and this life'll get crazy (Crazy)

Geekin' up, 'bout to stop being sober
Livin' every day faded (Livin' every day faded)
Think I got me a dime, bottom bitch do whatever I tell her whenever I say it (Whenever I say it)
Come to find out her P stand for pussy and she give it to any player that's paying (Paying)
I can dig it, but not for no made man, that's too slow, that lil' money won't phase me
Like you keep pulling folks out the ditch that won't give you back shit and you know that it's crazy
I'm with brother, he helped me get that chip off my shoulder, he told me can't nobody save me
We done traveled, we come save the world, looking out for the girls and took care of the babies
I done took some real losses and losses, I'm sticking it back, ain't nothing you can say to me
Gunna Wunna just said what it was and you still tryna make this shit up and it's crazy

All this money, I'm going crazy

All these killers, I'm going crazy (Crazy)

Spending them racks, go crazy

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
Feel like I'm sittin' on a mountain, VVS
Pointers, water on me look like a fountain (Fountain, fountain)
Backend racks in, I need an accountant (Yuh), Cartier
Two-tone lens, I don't need the vouchers (Vouchers)
Hid the Hi-Tech seals in the couches
Landed in LA, 3 hours, smoked me three whole ounces (Yuh, yuh)
Pulled up in the same state, performin' in different counties (Yuh)
Four rings on my fingers, ayy, I resemble an Audi (Ayy)

[Verse 1]
That's on everything, everything, yeah
Walk in the mall buy everything
Everyday I change, Chanel strings
Play no games, Alexander Wang on her nail paint
Your drip insane, where the fuck my paint? Stop playin' games
Watch your range, my nut deranged, they actin' ways
Go get paid, the condo laid, got Frito Lay (Lay)
Family straight, don't see no shade, the Dolce way
My new-new babe loves lemonade, like Beyoncé
We the wave, ahh, flyin' out of PDK (PDK)
Smashin' in the Lamb I barely use the brakes (Use the brakes)
I'm in New Orleans on my birthday, I got beaucoup cake (Beaucoup cake)
Gon' have to man that sail little harder for you to feel the lake

Title: NOTHING 4 FREE
Release Date: July 24, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Gunna-nothing-4-free-lyrics
Song Description: Gunna reunites with close friend and frequent collaborator NAV on NOTHING 4 FREE, a braggadocious song in which they talk about the genuine and legitimate way to earn something without cheating or taking any shortcuts to get there, going from the start to the finish.

Mainly, Gunna handles this song, taking the chorus and the first verse, with NAV coming in on the second verse. Aside from boasting about their excessive amount of money, the two proudly drop references to their choices in cars, drugs, and women, expanding on their expensive and lavish lifestyles.

This song is produced by Gunna and NAVs close friends and record producers, Pro Logic and Rex Kudo, and Heavy Mellow, who all wrote it with the artists. It is made up of a guitar-heavy trap beat throughout the whole song, a surprisingly unique style that is frequently used in the discography of both artists. It was released as part of the deluxe version of the Atlanta rappers chart-topping sophomore studio album, WUNNA, on July 24, 2020.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Ooh, Twix, stop playin'

Flooded, flooded

[Chorus]
AP and Patek Philippe, flooded (Flooded)
And got the Richard Mille, flooded (Ice)
Cubans and bracelets and necklace (Ice), flooded
Stones in my teeth like they braces, flooded (Flooded)

[Verse 1]
Gold diamond chains, I'm the new Mr. T
All this ice on me, I could go and ski
Shorty on fleek with this Patek Philippe (Fleek)
Whole lot to see, clarity Vs
Cold like a polar bear, North Pole
Money stretch all the way from North Dakota (Dakota)
Know pretty bitches like Coca-Cola
Diamonds hit like they inmates in Angola (Hmm)
Look like a fight (Fight)
Block out your sight (Ice)
Whole lot of ice on (On)
These diamonds bite, we shining bright
Look like a light show (Show)
Hell of a price, expensive nights

None of this shit came from Johnny Dang
Eliantte got me goin' insane
Diamonds updated, they 'head of the game
I'm underrated, they AP from Vegas
They hated, I waited, I knew shit would change
Pull up, Mercedes, my neck lookin' crazy
They hated, I waited, I knew shit would change
My life is wavy, I'm highly sedated
They thought I was crazy, I bought some more chains
Flood out the shady, I iced out the baby
And they goin' crazy protecting the name
Reach for these stones and get popped in your brain
No one's smoking stronger, they ain't stoppin' the train
Today is rose gold, I'm not rockin' the plain
I don't got it on, then I don't feel the same

[Chorus]
AP and Patek Philippe, flooded (Flooded)
And got the Richard Mille, flooded (Ice)

Title: time reveals, be careful what you wish for
Release Date: May 10, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Gunna-time-reveals-be-careful-what-you-wish-for-lyrics
Song Description: Time Reveals, Be Careful What You Wish For by Gunna has a smooth, melodic trap sound.

The track blends moody, atmospheric beats with Gunnas laid-back, auto-tuned vocals, creating a reflective vibe.

The lyrics focus on the passage of time, success, and caution about desires, with a subtle, introspective tone underscored by chill, bass-heavy production.

Its a contemplative song that pairs Gunnas signature flow with a mellow, almost haunting instrumental.
Lyrics:

[Part I: time reveals]

[Chorus]
Should have been done by now
But you didn't know how to handle the feeling
Should have been done by now
But you better go your way, go your way

[Verse 1]
I'm startin' to cut these bitches off, I'm tired of playin'
You had your chances with a boss and killed the plans
That's part my fault from pickin' so we can get in bed
Nowadays, I'm feelin' picky, leavin' that bitch on read
It ain't no more pre-kickin', you see what I'm sayin'
I just tell that bitch to pull up 'cause I can
I see some shit don't go as planned, I understand
Started to learn life, and you'll just stand just as a man
I'm tryna get back the way I hustled and felt the thrill
I'm tryna stay rich so I can cover every bill
I'm stayin' in pocket, a quarterback in the field
Passеd on some watches, bought a house in Hiddеn Hills
Ain't havin' time now, she leavin' out the crib
Let her put on the Gucci slides, take off the heels
Still havin' ice but on the real, I'm really chill
You can ask my classmates, I had spill before the deal
You might also like[Chorus]
You could be done by now
But you didn't know what a heart you were given
They thought you'd be done by now
But you better go your way, go your way

[Verse 2]
Press on my jeans, small tee from Chrome Hearty
Chains on my belt, I'm rockstar without the Harley
I feel the growth and can't nobody stop the chartin'
This ain't the same young Gunna Wunna that rock the Cartis
I don't care to go all around the world for your after-parties
I still gotta grind and put in work to keep havin' money
You gon' get the short end of the deal when you gettin' fronted
One thing they'll always say, you real when you keep it honest
You ain't gon' really see me comin' like a comet
I'm one of one, I'm rich and humble, they payin' homage
She like and watch how I'm on time right when it's clutchin'
I'm in her spine, shootin' cum inside her stomach
Hold my own weight, go my own way, I can't go for nothin'
Ain't gotta sin, I know my fate, and my pressure bussin'
I take my time, I learn to wait, can't nobody rush it

[Chorus]
You could be done by now
But you didn't know what a heart you were given
They thought you'd be done by now
But you better go your way, go your way
[Bridge]
But time will reveal, time reveals
You realize
You should thank God, someone who loves you
But time will reveal, you realize
We will rise
You should thank God, someone who loves you
Someone who loves you

[Outro]
Should have been done by now
But you didn't know how to handle those feelings
Should have been done by now
But you better go your way, go your way
But you better go your way, go your way
[Part II: be careful what you wish for]

[Chorus]
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you wish for

[Verse 1]
Life is special, gotta be careful what you wish for, yeah
It ain't much left, but you still got breath, ain't gon' always be fair
It ain't take me long way before I got on, Wunna always would share
Get rich so I could take care of my fam, it's what I wished for, yeah
I barely had patience and I always was anxious
One thing about life, when you makin' some millions, it could always be dangerous
I gotta pay security to live at my crib 'cause I wished to be famous
[Chorus]
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you wish for

[Verse 2]
Why they go out they way just to prove they point?
All that clout got 'em angry
How you gon' get rich and forget your wish?
Boy, thank God that you made it
Maintainin' this life, you runnin' through Ms, tryin' get through these phases (Get through these phases)
Hundred racks for your crib, guard-gated
You done ran them bands, you say you the man, you gotta take care of the lady
Heard you had a kid, it wasn't part of the plan, but fuck it, you glad that you made it
Got a Maybach truck and a new sedan, so now they both got Mercedes (Both got Mercedes)
Three hundred racks get your family straightened (Three hundred racks get your family straightened)
Rich problems, you can't complain (You can't complain)
Foreign cars and these new diamond chains (Foreign cars and these new diamond chains)
Superstar, you spend to stay sane (Stay sane)

[Chorus]
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you wish for

[Outro]
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you wish forEmbed

Title: ​ca$h $hit
Release Date: June 16, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Gunna-ca-h-shit-lyrics
Song Description: ca$h $hit, as its title implies, displays a boastful Gunna, bragging about his own money, along with a variety of women.

The tracks focus is essential to the entirety of a Gift & a Curses theme. More specifically putting down Gunnas own haters, flaunting his success, and addressing fellow YSL member Young Thug, who was incarcerated in May 2022 in relation to a Racketeering case. This is reflected in a Gift & a Curses cover, which has the United States Dollar sign outlined on Gunnas right eye, along with other more serious symbolic themes, such as the Crow on his forehead  known to represent adversity Gunna faced after his December 2022 guilty plea before the start of YSLs RICO case.

Big Gunna Wunna, yeah, big fact
Got your bitch checkin' in like a dispatch
Ain't 'bout money, I don't wanna chit-chat
I don't care if it gotta be a couple of years, still, I'm gon' get my lick back
You know where I came up, you know who I run with, my nigga, don't ever forget that
Been flooded the Range, been flooded the chains, and gave the kids drip, they remember that
I might beat the dope where a village at
I hop out that Maybach, jump on a jet
They false advertisin', they act like they want it, I gave it and they ain't even want it yet
It's VVS diamonds if I'ma go diamond, this chain like a Christmas ornament

On Sundays, I'm eatin' on Sunset
I'm holdin' it down, I watch from the mound
I keep it on, look for the context
Young Wunna the one, word to Complex
Get money and travel a compass
I told you a nigga ain't done yet
I heard the blogs comparin' my number, I guess they think it's a contest
Ain't worried 'bout it, got way bigger problems, and yet, I'm buildin' a company
Everyone who fake it, I act like they traded, I swear I don't want no apology
One of the greatest, I got fans every city, every state and that's my reality, uh
Southside, ridin' down Mallory
Hundred, it burn like calories
Runnin' a rich man's salary
Allergic to broke, I got allergies
Stone in my mouth, not a cavity
If I fuck, then this bitch wanna marry me
She look like she wanna inherit me
I'm geekin', I need some more clarity (All of my diamonds clarity)

Came out the bottom, I count a whole lotta, young Gunna worth millions of dollars (Millions of dollars)

A dirty thirty, I hit it like Curry, they hit me, I don't even holler (Yeah, don't even holler)

Switch out my cars and my addy, my family straight and that's all that matter (Yeah, all that)
Stackin' them racks in the safe and prepare for whatever, whenevеr it happen (Whenevеr it happen)
I put my trust in my faith, when I'm walking through straight, I don't see no one else (See no one else)
No, it ain't Lauren, it's Raf Simons, it's VETEMENTS steps (Lauren, it's Raf, VETEMENTS steps)
Stay ready, I'm already prepped (Prepped)
Undefeated, I feel like the champ (Feel like the champ)
My bitch love the hunnids, we fuck and get money, she turnin' my tongue to a chair (Tongue to a chair)
You did it, I done it, you know how I'm comin', young Wunna show 'em what to wear (Show 'em what to wear)
Go pick up a bag and it's way cross the country and light up the smoke in the air (Yeah)
Bitch is so trim, I treat her like my twin when I shop it, I buy by the pair (Buy by the pair)
They said it was up with me, but I'm so trim right now, nigga, don't even care

[Chorus]
Came out the bottom, I count a whole lotta, young Gunna worth millions of dollars (Yeah)
I ice out the charm, my lil' bitch a model, she made a few M's off a followin' (Off a followin')
Young Wunna on tour, I BP the charter, livin' hakuna matata (Yeah, hakuna matata)
Ain't no more worries, I'm up at it early, young nigga tryna figure out his problems (Figure out his problems)

I got rich early, I'm steamin' from workin', it feel like I got a lil' hotter (Got a lil' hotter)
Countin' up cash in the casa, eatin' sweet corn, not pasta (Casa none of that pasta)
Living hakuna matata, rockstar, role model (Hakuna matata, role model)
Still blow smoke like Shotta, I sit back drinkin' out the gold bottle (Cris')
Spring collection, I got 'em (Yeah)
Put on a whole lotta (Drip)
Nigga, I don't chat, won't holler, I face my problems, I pop like collars (Pop like collars)
Nigga worth XY dollars, stacked big as a toddler, I won't even bother (Yeah, yeah, don't even bother)
Wunna should be studied and honored, the top dog under, I could write a novel (Hey)

Lyrics:

[Intro]
(Wheezy outta here)

[Chorus]
I was hoping that you'd notice me (Notice me)
I'm in the sky, baby, shine like a star, baby (Star, baby)
And I know you don't believe in me (Believe in me)
It's in my heart, baby, I'm goin' hard, baby
Say a prayer, I feel like I can't breathe (I can't breathe)
You left my heart aching, I'm torn apart, baby (Apart, baby)
And I know you gon' be missing me (Missing me)
Goin' so far, baby, my life a tour, baby

[Verse 1]
Got it on my own, but still I ain't independent
My day one been with me since day one, he got perfect attendance
I wеnt got rich, we started a business, now wе split the percentage
Thank God I dodged the sentence, I went from rags to riches (Rags to riches)
I made a better decision, I'm in a better position
I grew my wings like a pigeon, look like my wrist out the fridge (Fridge)
That bitch can bring out my demons, I said, "Lil' ho, you the witch" (Ho, you the witch)
I let her swallow my semen, but that ain't all that she did
I'm shinin' bright like a diamond, I hope and know you gon' see it (Know you gon' see it)
I'm smoke exotic Biscotti, 'member we had bags of the mid (Bags of the mid)
Ain't givin' no fuck nigga shit, I'm savin' this cash for the kids
I'm keepin' one hand in the SIG, gotta stay protected, you dig?

You left my heart aching, I'm torn apart, baby (Apart, baby)
And I know you gon' be missing me (Missing me)
Goin' so far, baby, my life a tour, baby

[Verse 2]
I'm hearing voices in my head sayin', "Boy, give 'em hell"
Gettin' on a yacht, we 'bout to sail, and they pray that we fail
They thought I went broke, so I copped that Patek, huh, Patti LaBelle
Real cheetah print skin inside of my jacket, huh, know I dress well
On the stage, my fans show me real love like I'm fresh home outta jail
I got a new girl that got real natural curls and don't use no gel
I'm a real-ass boss, you get laid off, you still might get a referral
I come from that South, boy, watch your mouth, you play, we gon' end your world
You lost, they say you got swirled, I'm a different breed like a merle
I'ma sip this oil 'til I hurl, all my girls in diamonds and pearls
Just want 'em to see that you chosen, I met you outta this world
I want 'em to see that you chosen, made it out the bottom of the barrel

[Chorus]
I was hoping that you'd notice me (Notice me)
I'm in the sky, baby, shine like a star, baby (Star, baby)
And I know you don't believe in me (Believe in me)
It's in my heart, baby, I'm goin' hard, baby
Say a prayer, I feel like I can't breathe (I can't breathe)
You left my heart aching, I'm torn apart, baby (Apart, baby)
And I know you gon' be missing me (Missing me)
Goin' so far, baby, my life a tour, baby3Embed

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Young nigga colorblind, blue hunnids all I see
And them bust down, got some diamonds and some molly on me
And I let her ride, she a dime, and plus I gotta dime on me
She a wild lil' beast and I'ma let her ride on me
Foreign outside, wide body ain't got no key
And we touring out of town, bitch say she never see me
Told bro we ain't take this route we was never gon' eat
Glad I made it out the jungle I'ma feast with the belly of the beast

[Verse 1]
Yeah, told you I'ma show you who I am
Touchdown, came home from jail
Still had dope on the scale
These niggas thought I would fail
Went and got a Rollie, Audemars (Audemars)
Keep the finer K like the fair
Sitting on some bands like a chair
And I was tryna whip some fish scale
You see me coulda sent it through the mail
Walked in the spot, had a smell
Shit was all white, looked pale
And I got the last bale off
I was tryna shoot but I was shell
And they say the lean help my health
Smoke the shit leave it in the air
And we'll never leave, we'll never fail
'Cause we the last real niggas left
All my young niggas real
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pull up at the spot we Dare
We ain't never ever care
We gon' cop designer every pair
I cherish this shit and we share

You stand in line for the J's
I was tryna cop some new Ye
They told me Gunna Gunna you the wave
Now I'm tryna go and catch a play
And I hadda good day
Told my bitch she slay
Barber never gave me no fade
But a nigga down to catch a fade
Treat him like a meal, he a plate
I ride around with them snakes
And all my niggas gon' shake
All my niggas livin' off fate
I'm just staying down for the come up
And I'm going hard give it all what it take
Told you was no time to debate
Don't put me on the time I ain't late
Told you I'ma grind for the A
Used to get them pounds from the bay
Niggas better stay down and lay
On the fucking ground in your face

Young nigga colorblind, blue hunnids all I see
And them bust down, got some diamonds and some molly on me
And I let her ride, she a dime, and plus I gotta dime on me

Lyrics:

[Intro]
(Ah, it's like a breath of fresh air)

[Chorus]
All I feel is pain, but it's gon' be alright
Dirt all on my name, say I'm wrong and I ain't right
I ain't sleepin' through the night
But I hope we be alright (We be alright)
But I know we be alright
This money and the fame brought me pain and it changed
But I know we be alright (But I hope we be alright, be alright)
A lot of people changed, it won't ever be the same
But it's gon' be alright

[Verse]
They let me out the chains on a suspended sentence
I didn't lеarn my lesson about payin' attention
It don't feel like a blеssin', tell God I'm repentin'
If y'all talk to my dog, just tell him I miss him
Wonder why this pain ain't killin' my rhythm
Shit was just not evident, I didn't use the common sense
Bossed away anonymous, shit eat me up, I'm hella sick
Takin' all this medicine can't numb my pain at all
Most of you irrelevant, can't take it to the heart
They can feel what they feel, but I will never hide my scars
I done crossed some paths that I would've never thought I saw
And they left me with a loss

But I'm gon' be alright (We be alright)
But I know we be alright
This money and the fame brought me pain and it changed
But I know we be alright (But I hope we be alright)
But I know we be alright
A lot of people changed, it won't ever be the same
But it's gon' be alright
All I feel is pain, but it's gon' be alright
Dirt all on my name, say I'm wrong and I ain't right
Niggas goin' insane, it get hard to see the light
You hold your head in shame, but it's gon' be alright, uh
Carry my pain, one day, it get light
Tallyin' and the days just pass me by
Terrible mistakes, I can't ask God why
But I know I'll be alright
But I hope we be alright (We be alright, YSL)
But I know we be alright
This money and the fame brought me pain and it changed
But I know we be alright (But I hope we be alright, be alright)
A lot of people changed, it won't ever be the same
But it's gon' be alright (But I hope we be alright, be alright)Embed
