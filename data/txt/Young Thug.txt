Artist: Young Thug, Alternate Names: Jeffery Williams, Jeffery L. Williams, Jeffery, Thugger, SEX, Jeffery Lamar Williams
Artist Description: Jeffery Lamar Williams (born August 16, 1991), popularly known as Young Thug, is an innovative trap artist from Atlanta known for his experimental vocal styles on versatile production ranging from hard trap beats to experimental pop records. Thug is known as a pioneer for much of the 2010s generation of rap, and his constant cosigns, features and chart presence cement his status as a leader in the streaming era and current rap scene.

While Young Thug released his first mixtape in 2011, it wasn’t until fellow ATL trap artist Gucci Mane took Thug under his wing in 2013 that he began to see great success as an artist. That year, Thug released his first major hit, “Stoner,” which quickly gained viral traction on social media, then “Danny Glover,” which propelled him to an even larger scale of success. After Gucci Mane went to prison in 2013, Thug saw success by re-aligning himself with Cash Money Records’s own Birdman and his newly-formed Rich Gang collective with the hit single “Lifestyle” and a collaborative mixtape before officially signing to 300 Ent. in 2015. Under 300, Thug continued to release many more singles, mixtapes, and features, gradually boosting his popularity before releasing his debut album, So Much Fun, which topped the Billboard 200 in 2019. He has since released his sophomore album, Punk, in 2021 and his third album, Business Is Business, in 2023.

In 2017, Young Thug officially founded his own label, Young Stoner Life Records, consisting of Lil Duke, Gunna, the late Lil Keed, and Wheezy, among others. The label has released two compilation albums together, 2018’s Slime Language and 2021’s Slime Language 2. Thug has also officially released collaboration projects with Bloody Jay, the late Rich Homie Quan, Future, and Chris Brown, along with being a major participant in the group projects Lobby Runners and Bankroll Mafia.

After 2015’s “Best Friend” became Thug’s first platinum single, his 2016 collaboration with Travis Scott, “pick up the phone,” became his new highest-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100. This would later be succeeded by “Havana” with Camila Cabello, the best-selling single of 2018. However, his current highest-charting song as a lead artist is “Hot,” which topped the Rolling Stone 100 and peaked at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100, surpassing his previous biggest hit, “The London,” which peaked at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Young Thug has been cited as an inspiration for many popular artists outside of YSL, including Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Baby, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, 03 Greedo, James Blake, and Kanye West. While many have dubbed Thug as a huge musical inspiration, Jeffery himself consistently cites Lil Wayne as his biggest idol and influence, even though they have both publicly spoken about their past issues with one another, which have since been resolved.

Young Thug’s frequent collaborators outside of YSL also include Drake, Migos, Travis Scott, and 21 Savage, along with producers London On Da Track, Metro Boomin, Supah Mario, TM88, and Southside.

In May 2022, Young Thug, alongside Gunna and 28 other YSL associates, was arrested and charged in a RICO indictment filed by Fulton County. In June 2023, while incarcerated awaiting trial, Thug released his third studio album, BUSINESS IS BUSINESS, an album comprised of various songs Thug had recorded from 2018 through his arrest, executive produced by Metro Boomin.

Title: Best Friend
Release Date: September 14, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-best-friend-lyrics
Song Description: Best Friend is the fifth song on Thuggers first edition of Slime Season.  Produced by Young Shad and Ricky Racks, Thug comes hard with his crooning and braggadocios style to brag about his bestie.

This song was met with controversy upon release when Louisiana rapper Tokyo Vanity threatened to sue Thugger. According to Complex Magazine, Vanity is threatening to sue Thugger for copyright infringement, claiming he stole her song Thats My Best Friend.

The Fader interviewed the director of the music video, Be El Be, who shared his opinion on who Thuggers best friend really is:

If [Young Thug is] his own butler, if hes catching himself with himself, making love to himself, if hes in the bathroom getting changed and its just him and himits showing his best friend is himself. That self-esteem! Hes a very stylish young man, so I would say that the inside meaning of that is that he is his own best friend.

On September 14th, 2015 the official music video was released by Young Thug. It is co-directed by Be El Be and the visuals show Thugger running into himself in everything he does. Pitchfork said it best (in regards to describing the video):

Young Thugs video for Best Friend begins with Young Thug walking in on Young Thug, whos in the process of hooking up with Young Thug. Then, Thug jumps in a car driven by Thug. Eventually, Thugs head is served at a dinner attended by Thug. 

Fun Fact: 5 months later from the release of the music video, Young Thug read out the lyrics on GQ  so people can understand him better and simply for laughs and giggles!

Title: The London
Release Date: May 23, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-the-london-lyrics
Song Description: On The London, Young Thug, J. Cole, and Travis Scott rap about what they would do with their significant others at The London, which could refer to a luxury hotel in either Beverly Hills or New York. They also boast their stature, wealth, sexual prowess, and ability to sell drugs.

It is the lead single from Thugs 2019 project So Much Fun, and his first official release since his September 2018 EP On the Rvn.

The single was first teased on May 11, 2019, when flyers were thrown out to attendees of Thugs set at Miamis Rolling Loud Festival. They featured the first line of Thugs verse on the track and teased the songs artwork and color scheme.
https://twitter.com/1sabsad/status/1127412788354330624

The song was teased again on May 21, 2019, during a since-deleted live stream on Thugs YouTube channel titled Meet Me At The London, which spanned over the course of more than twelve hours. The live stream focused on a woman painting a spider on a green canvas, again foreshadowing the songs artwork. Travis' involvement was also teased by a woman filling a cactus-shaped piata with candy.

The London received an official release two days later with less than an hours notice.
Lyrics:

How could you come up out your face
And say I ain't the hardest nigga you done ever heard?
I left a flock of rappers dead and buried
A verse from me is like eleven birds
Just did the math, that's like two thousand dollars every word
I'm on the verge, I'll beat the charge
I killed some niggas and I walked away from it
Then I observe, just how you curve
Then told the nigga that they gotta wait for it
"I know—I know you in high demand"
I'm ballin' on a pussy nigga like Juwanna Mann
I'm drownin' all inside the pussy like I never swam

Lyrics:

[Intro: Gunna]
Wheezy outta here
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call 'em chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Cartier eye
I'm the bossman in a suit but no tie
I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire
Shenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide
The latest Mercedes her go-to surprise
Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide
Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life
I told her to gargle and work on her highs

We call 'em chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Interlude: Young Thug]
Cash, money, checks, cash
Addy, Birkin, brand new extendos

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I took the Bentley coupe back, then I hopped in a Cayenne (Skrrt)
I put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (Skrrt)
Ayy, man, this synthetic weed, you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still double cupped up, I'm drinkin', I shoot off your tires, huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I'm in the coupe by myself
I had to kick a door when I was 5

In the field, Richard Mille on like Odell (Let's go)
She slid her hand down my pants just to grab the torpedo (Doo-doo-doo)
I had to go back and link with my slimes like I'm thirteen and zero (It's lit)
I told her, "Baby, this not the remix, this a part of the sequel" (Part of the seq')

Everything litty, I love when it's hot

We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Cartier eye
I'm the bossman in a suit but no tie
I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire
Shenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide
The latest Mercedes her go-to surprise
Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide
Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life
I told her to gargle and work on her highs

Stoner my lifestyle, I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud, that money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style
Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it
Young rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks
Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I got a pass like the staff
I'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' layup

Title: Relationship
Release Date: June 16, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-relationship-lyrics
Song Description: Relationship sees Thugger and Future croon over an instrumental reminiscent of early 2000s R&B and brag about their relationships with different women.

This song is their second collaboration since Young Thug and Futures beef which began in November of 2015 when producer Metro Boomin sent out  a series of tweets that stated Future started the trend of releasing multiple mixtapes per year, and that other artists should focus on dropping one good project. Young Thug, who already released multiple mixtapes that year, believed the tweets were directed at him, and sent multiple shots at Metro. Future also took to Twitter that night with a tweet that many believed was directed towards Thugger.

Another Twitter battle took place between Thug and Future hours before the release of Futures album EVOL. In September of 2016, Thug publicly apologized to Future, officially squashing their beef. They recently collaborated on the DJ Esco track, Who.



This songs production is handled by BL$$D, producer of the hit song Rolex, and Billboard Hitmakers, a production group who assisted with many of the tracks on Young Thugs last mixtape Jeffery.
Lyrics:

I paid extra for the crib, it got a game room
Got a penthouse in the back, it ain't my main room
Tamika, Jo and Porsche they kept it silent
That's the only reason I let 'em fly private
[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Shinin' hard 'cause we back up (Back up)
Rose gold from your neck up (Yeah)
You know shit gon' get sloppy, tryna check us (Check us)

I need to cut some of 'em off, I need help
I got some bad tings, I want her to myself
Had to take the time to cut 'em off, I need help
I know how to make the girls go crazy
When you treat her like your number one baby
Put my bitches on yachts, we don't do jet-skis
Put your ice on rocks, they need to help me44Embed

Title: Digits
Release Date: March 25, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-digits-lyrics
Song Description: Digits is one of the four tracks on Slime Season 3 produced by London On Da Track.

Leading up to the songs release, fans stitched together snippets of the song from Periscope and Snapchat. Digits was officially premiered on Zane Lowes Beats Radio, on March 24, 2016. An alternate version with Meek Mill was premiered by Funk Master Flex on April 2, a week after Slime Season 3 was released.

In an interview with the FADER, London on Da Track recalled making Digits, Memo, Worth It and Tattoo all in one day. The tracks were at least a year old at the time of release, but he remembered how Digits came together:

When he was laying down, he was just freestyling itjust doing melodies in the boothand I was like, Thats the shit right there. Then he figured out the words and from there he just flowed the whole track. It was easy for him, he does it in one take. Its crazy how he can finish a song in ten minutes.

The first line of the songs pre-chorus sparked a heated debate that became the subject of various memes about Thug singing horses dont stop instead of hustlers dont stop. Thugger eventually confirmed that he was saying hustlers, but his Southern drawl makes hustlers sound like horses.
Lyrics:

I might just do the Michael Vick, man, and cook it left hand
If you ain't talkin' 'bout buyin' grams then I'm a deaf man (Shh)

Title: Floyd Mayweather
Release Date: August 26, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-floyd-mayweather-lyrics
Song Description: Young Thug, Travis Scott, Gunna & Gucci rap about a luxury lifestyle on Floyd Mayweather, the track is named after American boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr., who is nicknamed Money and Pretty Boy.

Floyd Mayweather actually almost signed Young Thug to his TMT music label in the past. Theyve also been spotted in the studio together this year.

Thug has mentioned Mayweather before numerous songs, including Heart Attack, Mind Right, and Yamborghini Dream.

There are three versions of the song. The original release did not include Travis Scott and a Gunna verse, but it was later updated on Apple Music and other streaming services to include the Gunna verse after Gucci and the Travis verse after the next Thug verse. In the third version, which is now the one playing on all streaming services, the Gunna verse comes in before the Gucci verse with another bar at the beginning, and the rest of the song is mostly similar to the second version.

Although Young Thug and Travis Scott have collaborated on eight prior songs, this song along with Pick Up the Phone mark the first time Travis Scott has ever appeared on one of Thugs projects.

Title: Anybody
Release Date: April 13, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-anybody-lyrics
Song Description: Anybody is the first single of 2018 by Atlanta artist Young Thug, with his first collaboration with Nicki Minaj since 2014s Danny Glover remix.

The song was leaked two days ahead of its expected release on April 13, 2018, and it came as somewhat of a surprise to fans considering that Thugger previously said he wouldnt be releasing any music in 2018.

On April 10, both artists hinted at the songs release after they both tweeted the number 3. Thugs go-to engineer, Alex Tumay, also joined in, further adding to the speculation.

Why don't you act like a Hoffman, and go get to dustin'?
Yeah, latex on my drawers, bitch, go clean my crown
Can't hear my haters from way up here, they don't make a sound
Body goals on these hoes, white paint on my toes
When I send that new bae alert, niggas gon' be mad
Jumpin' in the Bent', then I switched to the Ghost like, "Who's you?"
Remember this face 'cause I'm that bitch you gon' lose to
Drippin' in the ice, fuck you lookin' at? Screw you
It's squad goals when all your bitches pretty like New New

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I never killed anybody (Body)
But I got somethin' to do with that body (Somethin', just shh)
I got the streets on my back (On my back)
Carry it like I'm movin' a body (Huh)
I told them to shoot a hundred rounds (Do-do)
Like he tryna movie the body (Movie)
It was like 11 in the mornin'
Skippin' school, that's a truancy body
I made me some racks in the mornin'
I had me a pack by the mornin'
I had me some racks by the mornin'
I had a six-pack by the mornin'
I got on a mink, no pneumonia
The racks keep me up, don't need Folgers
I had a pack in my shoulder
You gotta picture me rollin'
[Outro: Young Thug]
Jumpin' in the Bent' with the too-dark tint
And who's you? (Who's you?)
My shawty pullin' up with a real bad bitch
I wanna fuck you too (Fuck you too)
Drippin' my swag, ooh, pop tag, I'm (Mmhhm)
I got a Smith & in the bag now
I get all type of cash, I'm a general, tru (hey)

Title: Harambe
Release Date: August 26, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-harambe-lyrics
Song Description: Young Thug named this song to honor Harambe, the beloved gorilla who was killed after a child fell into his enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo on May 28, 2016.

Thug pays his respects to and remembers Harambe with this track. He said on Twitter that the songs were named after his idols, making Harambe the youngest idol on the album, aged just 17 at his death.

After the shooting, there was controversy as to whether or not killing Harambe was the right decision. While some claimed that it was justified, others disagree, claiming that the tragic death could have been avoided.

In August 2016, 2 and a half months after Harambe died, a new wave of memes surfaced, spawning multiple opinion pieces on the topic. This track has ensured the matter remains in the public eye.

Title: Take Kare
Release Date: October 16, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-take-kare-lyrics
Song Description: After joining Birdmans Rich Gang group with Rich Homie Quan and releasing multiple tracks with the group, most notably the  banger Lifestyle, Thugger finally releases a collaboration with the inspiration for his music career, Lil Wayne. Note the Blood influence in the title  both Thugger and Wayne are Bloods, so the C in Care is replaced with a K, in typical anti-Crip fashion.

Almost a year after releasing it as a single, Young Thug made this song the opening track to his mixtape, Slime Season.

One of our own, Brian Duricy, wrote this article
 regarding this song and the passing of the metaphorical torch from Lil Wayne to Young Thug.
Lyrics:

Title: Family Don’t Matter
Release Date: June 16, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-family-dont-matter-lyrics
Song Description: In Family Dont Matter, Young Thug kicks off BEAUTIFUL THUGGER GIRLS, setting the country-trap tone for the rest of the album. The song itself discusses his relationships with close friends and associates, alongside Young Thug staples such as flaunting weapons and drug use.

Interestingly, on the songs SoundCloud release, it bears the title Like Family Dont Matter and features the Icebox interlude in the beginning instead of the end of the song.

Originally, both Thug and Millie Go Lightly each recorded their own solo songs over the same Wheezy beat. One day, Wheezy realized this and played Millies demo for Thug, and Thug liked it so much that he had her re-record her vocals for a verse and harmonies on his version of the song.
Lyrics:

Title: You Said
Release Date: June 16, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-you-said-lyrics
Song Description: In You Said, the seventh track off Beautiful Thugger Girls, Young Thug describes a relationship between himself and a woman. In this song, she seems to promise a lot to him, yet always fails to deliver. While she seems to have a sexual attraction to Thugga, it seems to be nothing more than that. Post-release, the song was updated to feature a new verse from Quavo.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Young Thug]

Lyrics:

[Intro: Future]
Wheezy outta here

[Chorus]
Ooh-woo, diamonds peek-a-boo
Ooh-woo, I done fucked her crew
Ooh-woo, I done did the robbin'
I done did the jackin', now I'm full rappin'
I put on my brothers, I put on my bitch
Had to wear the dress 'cause I had a stick
You know where the bag at, tell me where it is
I came from rags to riches, I'm the shit
I can no longer disguise it, bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I got cars galore, lil' bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I escaped every one of the licks 'cause I was supposed to be rich
I don't care nothin' 'bout no cop, I'm tellin' you just how it is

[Verse 1]
Put it in a Uber, send it to a shooter
Ask me how they do it, kickin' shit, Ryu, Ken
Put it in a cab, send it to a Arab
Hit 'em with the MAC now, now his whole body scabbed
Cash on delivery (Ayy)
G.O.A.T. talk of the century (Oh)
No time for gibberish, all the critics hearin' this
All the bitches lipstick, and her pussy slippery
I can call a troop, go by the name of Duke
Kidnap a kangaroo, I can send a moose (Woo)
Niggas stole a chain, but I ain't worried, fool

Fuck around and air the pussy nigga out like linen
Last nigga tried me almost got popped in Lenox

Ask the cops and the detectives, all the jurisdictions
Ask the kids at school who ambition all the missions
Gave the lawyer close to two mil', he handle all the killings
I don't know and I don't wanna know who 'flaged Bentleys
I don't know what's goin' with bro, I think they all spillin'
We don't speak 'bout shit on wax, it's all mob business
We known to kill the biggest cats of all kitties

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
My career 'bout to blast like bubbly
I'm not waitin' for her to say she love me
I can tell she fuck with me, man, trust me
I got a ten-year-old mink still ain't fuzzy
Three-twenty-five on the dashboard
Ridin' in the Porsche, rockin' Tom Ford
I ball at Barneys, new Christian Dior
I took the jet to the New York store
She lick while I'm drivin', I'm stainin' the floor
I took it off track, now I'm ridin' in sport (Yeah)
You stay in your feelings, you never my boy
I can't come to the hood, I pull a decoy
Another body drop and they screamin' my name
I'm goin' to L.A. on a private plane
Could never come back and my family straight (Grrah)
I'm touchable? No, I'm too rich and too paid
Skeleton Cartier, black diamonds face
Pull up too deep like a fuckin' parade
Old jealous-ass niggas tryna fuck up my pay (Ha)
Blast off, Rolls-Royce Cullinan rain (Broke niggas)
I put baguettes in my wrist and my neck and my ears and my motherfuckin' chains (Chains)
This drip out the trenches, I know you gon' dig it, I come through this motherfucker plain (Woah)
I cut up my wrist, soakin' wet (Yeah) and Coachella keep callin', they won't see the face
I took her to China and changed up her climate and now she ain't talkin' the same (Woah, yeah)

Five nights up, still poppin' and ragin'
The SVR still livin' deranged (Yeah)
I want her, she wanted the same
Hit 'em both same time, both glad that they came (It's lit)
Keep me a vibe, but can't keep it contained
Know I keep me some dawgs, always keep 'em in training (Oh)
Tat' a logo on the back of my brain
Don't ask me what the fuck am I thinkin'
Back of these walls, I'm full of that drank
Eric came through with a little entertainment (It's lit)
Area 29, got it lookin' like space
Houston, it's a problem way we bustin' up faces and shit
I came with the snakes, no squids (Straight up)
I broke out the game with a 456
She lovin' the fest', I see it
She lovin' the fest' (Straight up, straight up)
Yeah, I see it on her face, and I'm lovin' that body
In lace, I know you lovin' Spider and Jack
Yeah, I know you got taste, if you love yourself, take shots with me
If I love you, I'll drop you a pin to a time and a place (Wait)

[Verse 3: Drake]
YSL'll put a nigga six feet
I ain't beggin' when I tell a bitch, "Please"
Me and lil' Thugger on fleek
Now that lil' ho wanna meet, ayy
What, what, what, what?
Fuck her on beat
OVO life not cheap
I'm a young boy too T'd
Wire just hit my account, never seen that amount, oh God, I'm geeked
Been on the charts for five hundred weeks, so somebody love when I speak
Doin' this shit just to show we get down in the 6, man, it's bigger than me
Texas ranch so big, that shit is perfect for the dippin'
I don't care how wet I get her, she won't catch me—
Three-twenty-five on the dashboard
Ride in the Porsche, rockin' Tom Ford
Rockin' her bed and the headboard
What, what, what, what?
Buyin' out Louis and Christian Dior
I took the jet to the New York store
Park at the regular airport
You stay in your feelings, was never my boy31Embed

Just to be safe (Just to be safe)
Just to be safe, dawg (Just to be safe, dawg)
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe, dawg
Gotta make it home

[Verse 1]
Hop out the Bent and into the coupe
Fuzz hit my family, they switchin' it up
It ain't nothin' I could do (Nothin' I could do)
My trust is fucked up
I ride with that wooly, I pour my own juice
Just in case a nigga look on me, and try run up on me
I'ma fuck with the cougars
Elliantte gon' flood me, man fuck it I'm stuntin' on you
I hope you lay down and remember that I was just gunnin' for you (Fool)
They told me that I was gon' end up like MC Hammer
'Cause everything I get, I try to invest it in you
You too and you too
In the daytime a nigga havin' nightmares
I wonder if He answerin' every one of my prayers
Hate to say it but I go broke 'bout anyone of my peers
You ain't gon' never change this shit
Yea, I'm bustin' down, yeah
Every single mothafucker 'round me wrist gon' bust down, bust down
Ain't gon' get no second chance, you crossed me
I don't give a fuck about you
Yea, I'ma give up on you
Yea, I'ma hit the clutch 'bout you (Skrt)
I'ma throw it up by ya, yea, you better have luck by ya
Can't nobody ever beat the triple cross
I got snake in my veins, snake in my drawls
I got snake on my attire, snake inside my wounds
I put snakes around your eyes and, man, you gon' move

I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe, dawg (Just to be safe)

[Verse 2]
And I just wanna make it back to my kiddies
And I just wanna sit back and count these digits
Don't plan on lettin' nobody take their place
I pay more money to security than I make
And it's crazy but it's safe
I get to run around in peace everyday
I know my niggas go monkey like Bathing Ape
I tried to tell you, but you had to learn late
I was just holdin' you down and you didn't stay down like you 'posed to
I had you rollin' around in that Bentley Mulsanne and the Rolls too
I had you glossin' on all of these bitches just like you was 'posed to
I got you latest Chanel, and the latest Fendi, and the Gucci too
I told you, I love you forever
I'm never gon' change, I'm not stoppin', boo
I told you, I was gonna keep your lil' bank account full
And your pocket too
I start at your ear, I'ma lick it, then fuck around and end at the bottom, boo
Together forever, man
Any problem that you got, bitch, I got it too
[Chorus]
I'll cock it back, I'm ready to fire that chrome, hey
I was out the country, ain't know what time I'm on (Different time zones)
I was tryna get the devil out of my charms
I was thankin' God, I was thankin' Allah I'm on
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe (Just to be safe)
Just to be safe, dawg (Just to be safe, dawg)
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe, dawg
Gotta make it home27Embed

Title: Webbie
Release Date: August 26, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-webbie-lyrics
Song Description: The title of the song likely refers to the rapper Webbie.

Like many of the song titles in this album, Webbie was likely chosen as the title because he is one of the artists from which Young Thug draws inspiration.

Webbie, a rapper from Baton Rouge, has also collaborated with Boosie Badazz, whom Young Thug gave tribute to in F Cancer after he was diagnosed with cancer.

Young Thug has mentioned on Instagram how each song on the mixtape was named after one of his idols.

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ayy, ayy, I'm drippin' again

Ayy, they told me don't spend
I went got the racks and I did it again
Ayy, I think she a twin
Plus she got red calamari skin
Ayy, you don't got no wins
You should grab something white and just throw it on in
I went to school, got suspended
I told her I want some head, bobby pin
If the lil... don't got class, yeah, we call it truancy
I ain't had no money to spend
I got my first check and went paid off my rent

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith & Young Thug]
I poured a four from the clouds down
And my head floating in bliss (Goddamn)
I'm on the phone with big bro now (Damn)
He told me keep Benz on the race (Goddamn)
Until you see it like this, I promise man you'd never think it exists
Straight out a jet to the crib, I'm quick with the switch
Man we never miss, okay (God)
'Bout to turn up in the club, man, back the fuck up
We ain't takin' no pictures
See all the wings in the front, it's us
We had to triple the digits
See all those sexy mamas blowing kisses, man
We had to grant all they wishes (We grants-)

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Ay, let me pour up some Act, got some brand new graffiti
It's going down my back
I got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby, girl you can pick
Rocking Giuseppe Zanotti's a night
I spent half a million designer on kits
I got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby girl you can pick
I got so high, went off the equator, I feel like Buzz Lightyear
I met a broad, skinny like nails, and I was richer than ice cream
I had to grind without a rail, now all my cars got Nitron
Straight to Dubai, I feel like the mail, I was on a Global Express

Title: Lil Baby
Release Date: August 16, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-lil-baby-lyrics
Song Description: On Lil Baby, Young Thug brags about his celebrity status being on the Forbes list and name drops some of his peers and contemporaries in the rap game.

While it may seem at first glance that the song was named after Thugs frequent collaborator Lil Baby, the connection is merely a coincidence, as Thug addresses a significant other as lil' baby in the songs chorus, not referring to the rapper at all except for a shout out among over a dozen other rappers in an ad lib.

Shortly after So Much Funs initial release, Thug updated most songs on it, including this song. In the updated version, he adds more names as ad libs at the end of the first verse and has less strange effects on the vocals of the outro.

The track is one of the four Pi'erre Bourne-produced songs on the album, the others being Im Scared, Light It Up, and Surf.
Lyrics:

I gotta tell you that you'll die tonight
You go against these people, you gon' die slow, die slow

[Intro: Young Thug & Strick]
We out in Italy on the water (Slime, what's going on? It's feeling like they won)

Smokin' weed, smokin' dope (I gotta tell you that you'll die slow, die slow, die slow)

Yeah, on tour, I done missed my son's birthday

Nah, I— I lowkey, like, really see people ridin' past on boats right now out the window (Die slow, die slow)
It's just the— just the penthouse suite, it's nothin'— nothin' major, yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Told the lawyer that my brother ain't goin' back to prison
I don't give a fuck if I gotta turn that nigga Jehovah Witness
I'm just seekin' for God's soul 'cause I know something's missin'
Comme des Garçons boxers and I came from penny-pinchin'
Came out the struggle, nigga, I really had lost a brother, nigga
Got to fightin' with the deputy sheriff, I almost lost my mother, nigga

[Interlude: Young Thug]
And that's funny, that's funny, like
My mama had broke up with my dad for having another kid on her, and, um
He had came home one day and he saw, um, a car in the driveway
It was an off-duty sheriff— ahem
A deputy sheriff that my mom was fuckin' with, and, uh
They had a few words, and it ended with, um, my dad shooting and ended up in the hospital in a coma, and, uh, yeah, so
Fast forward like eight years later, so my sisters had got to fighting, and, uh
And they— and they— and they had a family member that was a deputy sheriff, and, um
My mom came outside to goddamn stop the fighting
The lady had got in the car and just pulled off doing at, like, sixty miles per hour, ran my mom over
She had a stroke and shit, but she alright
Yeah

I had her sendin' pictures to my mom phone when I was like eight, tuh
I always knew that I'd be great
'Cause my coach told me I was slow, but I was runnin' at a fast pace, huh
They tryna divide us and conquer the world with it
They got a couple of the guys and all of the girls with it
But I'm a mastermind, I see right through it
I see that you got couple diamonds and the rest of 'em pearls in it
They say you poor 'cause you Black right to your face (Yeah)
They say where you live, you'll never be able to own that place
My father said you can change it all with your performance
And by the way, your life is a VV stone charm
They take the land and then detect who all can come
But I tell you with a long-sleeve, I bear arms, ayy
I'm high enough to be on the Milky Way 'til morning
If you want it, you gon' get up earlier than any morning
If you want it, you gon' get up earlier than anyone
Put on my socks, grab my Glock, the stick under the couch
Tie off my shoes, you in flip-flops, and it's top of the top
R.I.P. Nipsey, know what I'm sayin'?

[Bridge: Young Thug & Strick]
If you were the one in my shoes, would you love?
Would you love, would you love, would you love, would you love?
If you were the one in
If you were the one in the prejudice, so why for hostility? Yeah
Would you run away, or would you come back nightly? (Woo)
[Refrain: Strick]
I gotta tell you that you'll die tonight
You go against these people, you gon' die slow, die slow, die slow

[Outro: Strick & Young Thug]

Title: Ecstasy
Release Date: August 16, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-ecstasy-lyrics
Song Description: A month before the start of their joint tour, Young Thug taps Machine Gun Kelly for the updated version of the originally solo Thug song Ecstasy, the third track on his August 2019 album So Much Fun. Over a hard hitting beat produced by DY Krazy and 12 Hunna, Thug and MGK rap about embracing the druggy lifestyle of hip-hop by consistently getting high and partying.

The collaboration was first teased by MGK a week before the albums release.

On September, 2018, Thug was arrested on a number of drug possession-related charges after he was taken into custody for possession and intent to distribute meth, hydrocodone, and marijuana. As Complex reports, other charges included possession of codeine, amphetamine and Alprazolam.

Title: Can’t Tell
Release Date: April 17, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-cant-tell-lyrics
Song Description: Cant Tell is the third song off of Young Thugs debut studio album Barter 6. Thugga and T.I. team up again for another banger, also featuring Boosie Badazz.

On this song, many assumed Young Thug threw a shot at Lil Wayne in the hook with the line, Pussy boy Ill leave you dead and call it dedication, in reference to Lil Waynes Dedication mixtape series. However, the song was recorded long before there were even any thoughts of beef between the two, and its confirmed to merely be a coincidence, or just a reference to the series if anything.

Title: Memo
Release Date: March 25, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-memo-lyrics
Song Description: Thug talks about how his rap career has affected him and those around him.

The idiom to get the memo means to become aware of a situation, especially one that most people already know about.

Thug wants you to know that hes already making money; if you didnt already know this, then you need to get the memo.

The beat used here is identical to the one used on his track Check where he similarly raps about his success and wealth.

Title: To Me
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-to-me-lyrics
Song Description: To Me, which was referred to as Everybody before the true title was revealed, is a leaked song by Young Thug. Thugger first teased the song on his Instagram after he had dropped the single, Safe, and many thought that it would be the first single off of BEAUTIFUL THUGGER GIRLS; however, this wasnt the case.

The song seems to be an ode to his on and off girlfriend, Jerrika Karlae, who is often a topic of Thugs music regardless of the status of their relationship.

On February 25, 2018, Thuggers go-to engineer, Alex Tumay, posted a short clip of him mixing the song on his Instagram story. As such, some believe that it may appear on producer Wheezys upcoming album.

Release Date: June 23, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-oh-u-went-lyrics
Song Description: Oh U Went is a catchy and repetitive track in which Young Thug raps about his rising affluence while recruiting Canadian superstar Drake to rap about his solidified place in the music industry, both artists come together to present a melodic, yet gangster-like trap song.

The song shares a similar cadence to Thugs Juice WRLD-accompanied, August 2019, Mannequin Challenge  similarly in which Thug raps in a bouncy, repetitive tone while Drake imitates Juices ambient flow.

In the track, Youth Thug makes several references to his gangster-like lifestyle, foreshadowing his May 2022 arrest as Drake reaffirms Thuggers words.

She caught me creepin' with my old ho
She ran up like "yeah, yeah," I was like "no, no"
My lookout man was my right hand but he was wrong, though
Then I seen some diamonds come off of my neighbor's porch
And it was her, she had a Louis Vuitton purse clean as detergent
She had the same exact face as my brother's nurse
And he in a hearse, I never looked at it for what it's worth

[Chorus: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
So I never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love (Ayy)

Lyrics:

[Intro]
I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever

[Verse 1]
She let me ride it like a caravan baby
I swear I need you to come lay right there with me
She say she down and she gon' lay and care for me
I don't know why she like the air that I'm breathing in
Baby, breathe in with me
You make me go brazy, I know you won't judge me
You might turn to wifey, give you wife things and babies

[Chorus]
I want you to love me forever
Baby you know that I came here for your destiny
She wanna drop it if she can, if she can baby
She wanna rock it with her hand, yeah a marriage

[Bridge]
She want it heavy like a bear
I told her drop that shit right here
I cut that pussy, barber chair
Then I'm goin' psh off in the air

Shine it up then bounce it, climbing in it just like a mountain
My bankroll big like a bouncer, spitting game like a counselor
Big old cross like a pastor, pop that pussy like a Snapple
Bitch I'm bleeding, where the napkins?
Body red like an apple
Screaming free my brothers, I still sleep with my mother
Last week I made a quarter, plus I still respect others
I can't believe it's not butter, that little bitch might be my supper
I get respect from her brother, Crenshaw boolin', Nipsey Hussle
Still prepared for them arrest, YSL we gon' wrestle
Chanel pouch on my left, fuck the cops we don't play
Benjamins, Grants talk back, I be like "who is that?"
They be like "where you at?", meet at the Valet at Saks

[Chorus]
I want you to love me forever
Baby you know that I came here for your destiny
She wanna drop it if she can, if she can baby
She wanna rock it with her hand, yeah a marriage

[Interlude]
I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever
Until we meet each other, oh
I want you to love me forever
Love me forever
I want you to love me forever
[Verse 3]
She love my life and she don't care
I flood my bitch and I don't care what they say about it
You just a diamond in the mine and you dirty
I like my bitches brown like James, no Worthy
Scratched out the alphabet, 'cept B bitch
Woah, she standing naked bookin' bhicken
Woah, I need them thick thighs on my chicken
You know, just got dropped off by Scotty Pippen
Woah, and I just wanna be loved11Embed

Title: Money
Release Date: June 27, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-money-lyrics
Song Description: Money is a trap-fused collaboration between Young Thug, Juice WRLD, and Nicki Minaj, produced by Charlie Heat. The song samples Eric Idles Money  Song, written for Monty Python Sings.

While Thug & Juice had previously previewed the song with just each other on it, in August 2019, Nicki teased the song until the first chorus while previewing music from her new album, hinting she had potentially been recording for it. The song leaked on February 29, 2020, with only Juice WRLDs & Young Thugs parts. Prior to its leak, the song had been one of their most highly anticipated snippets. On Tuesday, June 27, 2023, the song was officially released on Young Thugs album Business Is Business (Metros Version) with a recently recorded verse from Nicki Minaj as well.

Asian Da Brat also recorded a song on this same beat, but she later swapped out the beat for the final version of that song, Big  Racks.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Eric Idle, Young Thug & Tommy Genesis]
Some people say it's folly, but I'd rather have the lolly
With money, you can make a smash
There is nothing quite as wonderful as money, money, money, money
There is nothing like a newly minted pound
(Money, money, money, money)
Everyone must hanker for the butchness of a banker
It's accountancy that makes the world go 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
You can keep your Marxist ways, for it's only just a phase (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Money, money, money makes the world go 'round
(Who made the beat? Charlie) (Yee)

Gotta upgrade the stars, outer space for me (Yeah)
'Lotta blue cash in a rubber band (A lotta blue cash in the rubber)

I'm just drinkin' Act', Kurt Cobain (Uh)

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD & Young Thug]
Fresh to death, Gucci on my tomb

Take a Perky right before we fuck, then act a fool (Fool)
Sad money, I got blue face diamonds
I'm at the top, and I'ma keep on climbin'
I got a **** on my hip, no silence
My mama told me, "Don't trust nobody"
Damn, mama, you seen it comin' (Woo)
That's why I don't keep this heat for nothin'
Try me, then you're gettin' one (On God)
Plus one (Yeah), and a couple more, uh (Yeah)

I peep how you slide, I peep how you ride, and now they goin' off with your head
They know the reward's a hundred racks so they gon' do all that they can
Don't tell me you ridin' if you not gon' ride, we don't got no time for that playin'

Title: I’m Scared
Release Date: August 16, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-im-scared-lyrics
Song Description: On Im Scared, Young Thug links with Doe Boy and 21 Savage to rap about the dangers of their lifestyles, speaking on how theyre scared to be too involved due to potential surveillance by law enforcement.

The song was first previewed in an Instagram post made by Thug on March 21, 2019, which featured the caption:

Album MOOD: #GDMFDG @doeboyfbg

The caption was later edited to include 21 Savages handle.

Five days later, affiliate Ian Connor unknowingly confirmed the songs title as Im Scared in a Tweet.

A demo of Im Scared, which lacks the verse from 21 Savage but has another Thug verse at the end, leaked online on June 6, 2019. However, the leak ultimately did not affect the final songs appearance on So Much Fun.

Hop inside the coupe and drop the roof
'Cause I'm the mothafuckin' man, you dig?
Mama give me head, nut on her brain
And then I bought the bitch a brand new wig
I'ma pour up mud and now I'm livin' like a pig
Signed so many deals, I think I got the best sig
(I can write, I can write)
Hear no evil, I see no evil
I ain't kin to Wayne, but I called the bitch and now she my mamacita
Hey, big diamonds on me, mothafuckas lookin' like pimples
Don't let the fish eye fool you, bitch this a peephole
Play with my head, I'll bust your watermelon
Nigga movin' slower than a caterpillar
I got a hundred thousand hoes, tryna get a million
I got a hundred thousand coupes and I don't keep the ceiling
I'm almost at the finish and these niggas still beginning
I got more money than Martin so I pour up more Remy

Title: Udiggwhatimsayin
Release Date: September 16, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Young-thug-udiggwhatimsayin-lyrics
Song Description: Udigg asks the coded question, Do you dig what Im saying?. This is immediately funny, since 95% of the population does not know what Young Thug is talking about or even understand the words that he is saying. Thugger then proceeds to lay out a manifesto of sorts, talking about where he came from (nothing), the things that are important to him (bands), the type of person that he is (a boss), and the sort of things that he might do (who ride a car, steal your girl, bring it on, or maybe show mercy). He declares his loyalty to the Bloods and his personal crew, YSL. Ultimately he just wants the bands, though.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
You dig what I'm saying?
If they all hundreds I'ma count it fast, yeah
Wanted money, I couldn't enjoy a class
I'm a big old player, I got it from my dad, hey
Lil' mama dig what I'm sayin'
Keep it funky like an egg and you will never land
All my niggas they don't play, they all want it bad
My son a boss, he a lil bitty motherfucking man
I go crazy, I go brazy for these fucking bands
Fuck a lady, I replace her for these fucking bands
He so crazy, I'm not lazy, I want fucking bands yo

[Verse 1]
I'm a boss, fuck that bitch out on the balcony
I might take a picture and tell 'em to caption this
When I'm done fingering, I need a napkin and shit
Ocho Cinco, yes sir I'm catching it
Catch it, catch catch it, catch it catch it catch it
I'll take your necklace, I'll leave you neckless
I might not be cussin' but I ain't bluffin'
Niggas want problems, it's not nothing
I'm screaming bring it on like Gabrielle
I'm a real big dog, I don't kiss and tell, hell
First you want it, then second, you pale, yeah
Don't think he quick, he pulled up like a snail, oh
Water in his eyes, I let that sucker go
And I forgot to tell her that you were po
I'm not doing a twenty year sentence about you, you a ho

You break a rule on him or her, you get fined, nigga
These niggas know I run it up so they don’t try, nigga
I might screw you bitch with my broke pliers, nigga
Hell, yeah, all my cars they go fish tail
Hell, yeah, I'm YSL 'til I'm dead and pale
Kickin you niggas, getting money slow just like a snail
I told her the mail is how they send them bales
I can never be him, but you can wish me well
I came a long way from shopping at clearance sales
She let me cum in her hair just like some gel

Yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug & Mac Miller]
S-N-double-O-P, I'm a dizzog
Shit, he was talking brazy, I ain't lie, I knocked the nigga off
I ain't tryna give him a chance to kill me or take the stand on me
He know I just had a hundred thousand Ps Saran'd on me
I had to hand out all the rooms so she can't say I molested
I tried to take back all the watches, rings, and the necklaces
She said I'm takin' full advantage 'cause I'm never stressin'
'Cause I had feelings for this girl that barely owned a residence
Don't get me wrong 'cause it ain't nothing 'bout they money, nigga
I meant to tell you, since a kid, I been gettin' my own figures
I was bringin' in the racks and she was steady shopping
I'm talking big bills, all colors, nigga, Monopoly
I ain't trippin', bitch, I'm sharper than a damn machete
Super different, I even stood out on my own partners
Since a kid, I been a dresser, Thousand Island
I was shittin', my diamonds green, pissy porta-potty, woah (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Bitch talk to me while I'm sleepin', yeah, yeah
Swimmin' in the linen like deep-end, yeah, yeah
All I ever needed was a alibi, yeah, yeah
I don't need a motherfucking reason, yeah
Out of mind, so I keep a pizzy
Everything a hundred, I don't ever leave a fifty, yeah
Did my own half-time, if I was simple
What the fuck you think I'm rich for?
Why you think I'm always talking shit with my hand on my dick?
In the crib, these bitches turned it to a strip show
It's what it is, though
Yeah, yeah, it's what it is, though, yeah, woah
Leave me alone, take your ass home
If it ain't another million, I ain't pickin' up the phone
Phony motherfuckers always sittin' on a throne
All I want's some pussy, baby, give a dog a bone, yeah, yeah
I don't need a lot, but I got a lot
I don't need a lot, but I got a lot, yeah
Two hundred for the whip in the parking lot
Everything cuttin', turn this shit into a barbershop
Swear I'm always shinin', couldn't tell you if it's dark or not

Ain't talkin' car but I need her to spoil me

When she get mad she movin' in one day
I swear the baddest bitches got the biggest foreheads
Even when she mad she never take me to court day
I'm uptown baby, I'm uptown I'm passin' New Orleans

[Interlude]
My P.O. trippin' and shit, man
Talkin' 'bout I can't smoke so I'm just drinkin' the fuck out this drink you know
Poppin' them motherfuckin' Percs, nigga
No Xans, no downers, nigga, we up
Fuck you mean

Baby girl know that I'm a king
Hustle hard, million views without a machine
I just might marry that little bitch and call her my thing
Marry her two times the way she suck on my ding-ding
Put her out the house and make her leave all of the things
I bought her, I caught her cheatin' with a nigga, such a stalker
But I don't give no damn 'cause she mine yes I bought her
I pull up in the Lamb after school pick up her daughter
Every time she get mad she actin' like she don't remember
She don't remember nothin' good but she remember tenders
She remember they hopped on that wood and caught a splinter
She remember that time when they cooked me that TV dinner
She remember that time every time I snuck in the house all late
And I remember the time when she was serious she'd never play
Damn how you know bro
Got a new ho sittin' butt ass naked right in front of nigga stove
Nigga money stacked up like Ludacris afro
Got a hundred hoes I lie to like I'm Pinocchio
When they say they 'bout to leave I'm like, "Baby, don't leave"
I'ma run it up even if it come down to sellin' weed
I'ma stack them big bucks, yes I want that Chuck E. Cheese
I want them M's, no Mickey D's
Then I bounce back on them
I'ma catch a bitch and make her bite like a piranha
She gon' suck that dick and spray all over her all summer
I used to be broke and now they come in by the bundle
Take her on the date and then I cut her like a barber
Pull up on the fair with a bale of them birds
Piss on your bitch mouth like it's a curb
Cartier swag on my face, no nerd
I don't like talk, bro, tell 'em no words
[Bridge]
Officer...
Save me
I'm gone, so gone off a Perc
I done went from rappin' to reggae

[Verse 2]
Yeah, hottest, baby, blaze me
Akeem mink, no eighties
Grown money so you can't age me
Gators on my feet got scabies
Hundred-thousand hoes on my Avi
I'll send that pussy boy to Grady
I'll leave them pussy niggas skimpy
God, why'd they get me started?
Quan said he ridin' with four choppers no Harley
I'm known for drawin' on the plugs, yes, arson
I'ma put them bitches in they place so then they barkin'
Mama had me inside of a store 'cause I'm the Target
Baby you still suckin' cheap meat, it's like a market
I got a spot in Dunwoody with a WD Arthur
Bird told me these pussy niggas gon' try to murk me, but umm

[Refrain]
I call lil' mama Makaveli, she gon' ride with me
I call lil' mama Makaveli-veli-veli-veli
I call lil' mama Makaveli, she gon', she gon'
I call lil' mama Maka-Maka-Makaveli-veli
[Chorus]
And I want her ass 'cause she hot, no Clay
She got a nigga sittin' inside all day and
She make a nigga find out somewhere to stay
When she get mad she movin' in one day
I swear the baddest bitches got the biggest foreheads
Even when she mad she never take me to court day
I'm uptown baby, I'm uptown I'm passin' New Orleans

[Verse 3]
Chopper City
Fuck a Gates we chop that bitch, lil' boy, you trippin'
I'm the realest nigga Notorious BIG
First I kill you boy and then I make your bitch suck dick
Suck that dick lil' bitch, cuff that, spit lil' bitch
Swallow that nut lil' bitch, shit it out when you shit
I'm a creature, I'm amazing
Sit on that wood like you just walked inside a gymnasium
And your bookin' while I'm acein'
Playin' games on my turf you got to be a gangsta
I hope you ain't doin' nothin', boy, you a wanksta
You should know you want beef with Thugger gon' cater
You should know that these Bloods gon' be the waiters (Soo-woo)
Hundred S double M's
Hundred motherfuckin' whoadies
Hundred motherfuckin' gangstas
Hundred motherfuckin' troops
Hundred thousand of my people
Hundred thousand Pirus
Hundred thousand geeked monsters
Hundred thousand no bullshit
Better know what you're doin' before you do it
'Cause when I pull up I'ma let it loose I'm not pursuin'
I'm a motherfuckin' gangsta, niggas know I'm havin' rank
Ask Kurt, no Angle I'ma slap him with the banger
First I got the money then the power, no ranger
Just because you don't see me don't mean that I'm a stranger
Twenty thousand dollars on a smile no anger
I'm a beast bitch you can not tame12Embed
