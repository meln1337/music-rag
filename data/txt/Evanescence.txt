Artist: Evanescence
Artist Description: Evanescence is an American rock band founded in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1995 by singer/pianist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody.

Their fifth album, The Bitter Truth, was released in March 2021.

Title: Bring Me to Life
Release Date: March 4, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-bring-me-to-life-lyrics
Song Description: After Wind-Up Records insisted the group bring on a full-time rapper and the band refused, Evanescence went home, assuming they no longer had a record deal. However, the label contacted them again and a compromise was met  one song would feature a guest rapper, and that was Bring Me to Life.

It is the bands debut single and breakout song, bringing them international fame and success, helped by its inclusion on the soundtrack to the 2003 film Daredevil. It went to #1 in Italy, Australia and the UK, and reached the top 5 in Germany, Canada and the US in the spring of 2003.

In the UK, it was the last guitar-driven chart-topper to stay at #1 for four weeks until 2021 when Olivia Rodrigos third single Good 4 U accomplished the same  eighteen years later.

Lead singer Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody shared in an interview with AOL Sessions that the song was inspired by the desire to make the most out of life. Later, Lee told Songfacts it was inspired by a moment during a rough time in life when her future husband suddenly asked her if she was happy.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Amy Lee]
How can you see into my eyes
Like open doors?
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb

Without a soul (Soul)
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

[Chorus: Paul McCoy, Amy Lee]
Wake me up
Wake me up inside
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside
Save me
Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone
Save me
Save me from the nothing I've become

[Verse 2: Amy Lee]
Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me (Ooh, oh)

Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me

Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

Title: My Immortal
Release Date: November 4, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-my-immortal-lyrics
Song Description: First released on Origin, My Immortal is an Evanescence rock ballad describing the loss of a close relative or a significant other.

The song is named my immortal because it is about memories that seem not to be able to die.

The music video is shot in all black-and-white. It shows Amy Lee, Ben Moody and the band separately, never together in one shot. Ironically, the video was shot two weeks before Ben left the band. In an interview with Rock Sound, Amy admitted:

Its almost like the director knew what was going to happen, but he cant have known. Its just one of those fate things.

The video shows Amy never touching the ground, as a metaphor for being dead and unable to connect with the physical world. This connects with the theme of the song, which is obviously about the inability to reach out to a loved one that has gone.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

[Pre-Chorus]
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
And there's just too much that time cannot erase

[Chorus]
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

[Verse 2]
You used to captivate me by your resonating light
And now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me

[Pre-Chorus]
And these wounds won't seem to heal
And this pain is just too real
And there's just too much that time cannot erase

But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

[Chorus]

And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me, ah

Title: Hello
Release Date: March 4, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-hello-lyrics
Song Description: This song  the ninth track on Fallen  is about how Amy was feeling when her sister, Bonnie, died. When Amy was 6 years old she was told that her sister Bonnie who was 3 years old had died.

Hello. Im your mind giving you someone to talk to, hello is her conscience talking to her to try and calm her down.

This song shows how when you are 6 you dont quite understand what is going on and she didnt quite believe what was happening. What shes saying in the song is what she felt when she found out, and since she was so young, she didnt fully understand the concept of death.

The song has never been played live, despite consideration back in 2003 by Amy shortly after it was released.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Playground school bell rings again
Rain clouds come to play again
Has no one told you she's not breathing?
Hello, I'm your mind giving you someone to talk to
Hello

[Verse 2]
If I smile and don't believe
Soon I know I'll wake from this dream
Don't try to fix me, I'm not broken
Hello, I'm the lie living for you so you can hide
Don't cry

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping
Hello? I, I'm still here
All that's left of yesterday

Title: Going Under
Release Date: March 4, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-going-under-lyrics
Song Description: In Amy Lees own words, Going Under is:

[] about coming out of a bad relationship, and when youre at the end of your rope, when youre at the point where you realize something has to change, that you cant go on living in the situation that youre in.

It was initially going to be Evanescences first single on their debut album, Fallen. However, the release of the Daredevil soundtrack eclipsed the decision, resulting in the release of Bring Me To Life first.

The music video for the song was directed by Philipp Stlzl and it was filmed in May 2003 in Germany. It shows Lee performing on a concert along with the band, while fans are turning into zombies. She designed both the dresses she wears in the video. It ranked at #4 on the list of The 15 Scariest Music Videos Ever published by Billboard. Evanescence additionally added the song to the set-list on their Fallen and The Open Door Tour.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Now I will tell you what I've done for you
Fifty thousand tears I've cried
Screaming, deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still won't hear me (Going under)

[Verse 2]
Don't want your hand this time, I'll save myself
Maybe I'll wake up for once (Wake up for once)
Not tormented, daily defeated by you
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm
Dying again

[Chorus]
I'm going under (Going under)
Drowning in you (Drowning in you)
I'm falling forever (Falling forever)
I've got to break through
I'm going under

[Verse 3]
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
(So I don't know what's real)
So I don't know what's real and what's not
(Don't know what's real and what's not)
Always confusing the thoughts in my head (Oh)
So I can't trust myself anymore

Title: Everybody’s Fool
Release Date: June 7, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-everybodys-fool-lyrics
Song Description: Everybodys Fool is a song by American rock band Evanescence. The song was released as the fourth and final single from their debut studio album, Fallen. It was a top 40 hit in several European countries in the summer of 2004.

Lyrically, the song is about how celebrities fool the common folk into believing theyre perfect. They have no shame in lying to everyone, as image is better than actuality to them.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Perfect by nature
Icons of self-indulgence
Just what we all need
More lies about a world

[Chorus]
That never was and never will be
Have you no shame? Don't you see me?
You know you've got everybody fooled

[Verse 2]
Look, here she comes now
Bow down and stare in wonder
Oh, how we love you
No flaws when you're pretending
But now I know

[Chorus]
She never was and never will be
You don't know how you betrayed me
And somehow you've got everybody fooled

[Bridge]
Without the mask
Where will you hide?
Can't find yourself
Lost in your lie
I know the truth now
I know who you are
And I don't love you anymore

Title: Call Me When You’re Sober
Release Date: September 13, 2006, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-call-me-when-youre-sober-lyrics
Song Description: As one of the last songs recorded for The Open Door, Call Me When Youre Sober was predominantly inspired by Amy Lees ex-boyfriend and Seether frontman, Shaun Morgan. In an MTV News interview, Amy Lee spoke about the song being very personal to her:

It was very brave for me, the lyric writing, because I was just sick of hiding behind metaphors in all that I had been writing. So much of the record was about the turmoil I was going through, with choosing between happiness and comfort. In the end, I had to choose happiness and health for myself. I made the right decision. I was letting myself be run down.

Directed by Marc Webb, the accompanying music video is based upon modern re-imagining of Little Red Riding Hood. Due to the literal nature of the song and its lyrics, Amy Lee explained the importance for the video to have the freedom to go in a less literal direction. In 2007, Call Me When Youre Sober earned Evanescence two nominations in the best video categories at the MuchMusic Video Awards and NRJ Music Awards.

The song wasnt originally intended for inclusion on the album, according to Amy Lees father, John Lee. It was just a little ditty she was working on and singing on her piano at home to purge herself of a past boyfriend. She said she would laugh out loud while she was writing and singing it and thought it was funny, he added.

Upon its release, Call Me When Youre Sober received generally positive reviews from critics, and the song peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Top 100.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

[Verse 1]
Should I let you fall
Lose it all?
So maybe you can remember yourself
Can't keep believing
We're only deceiving
Ourselves, and I'm sick of the lie

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're too late

[Chorus]
Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me

So don't cry to me
If you loved me

You want me

[Post-Chorus]
You never call me when you're sober
You only want it 'cause it's over
Ah, it's over

How could I
Have burned paradise?
How could I
You were never mine

So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me

Title: Tourniquet
Release Date: March 4, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-tourniquet-lyrics
Song Description: Tourniquets are used to cut off blood supply to certain limbs, oftenmost used when a limb has been severed from the body.

The song, however, was originally written by Rocky Gray for his band Soul Embraced and was then called My Tourniquet. It was then reworked by the entire Evanescence band and released as Tourniquet.

Lyrically its written from a Christian standpoint, about suicide. Its from the perspective of someone who has just committed suicide and its about the controversy in Christianity that if you commit suicide, will you go to heaven or hell? If all sins are forgiven after accepting Christ, why would there be an exception?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more (So much more)
I lay dying and I'm pouring
Crimson regret and betrayal

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm dying (Dying)
Praying (Praying)
Bleeding (Bleeding)
And screaming
Am I too lost
To be saved?
Am I too lost?

[Chorus]
My God, my tourniquet
Return to me salvation (Oh-oh-oh)
My God, my tourniquet
Return to me salvation (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Do you remember me?
Lost for so long
Will you be on the other side
Or will you forget me?

Title: Hi-Lo
Release Date: November 10, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-hi-lo-lyrics
Song Description: Originally intended to be on Evanescences third album but never made the cut, Hi-Lo found its home on Synthesis. Violinist Lindsey Stirling makes a guest appearance on the song.

On the tour program booklet, the song is explained:

After 10 years in the vault, it is our pleasure to finally bring this song into the light. It was the first creative collaboration with Will Hunt (Spaceway), Synthesis producer and programmer. After a decade of not quite fitting in, it finally found its rightful home on this project.

The title is a portmanteau of the words high and low.

Lyrically, its about moving on and not being mad at the person who hurt you.

For Lindsey Stirling this song meant the fullfillment of an old dream. In an interview she said that she would love to collaborate with Amy Lee.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Amy Lee]
I don't know your heart
I don't know where to begin
But I could feel you erasing the rivers I'd drawn in
The more I stood still
The faster you were running
You don't know how it feels crawling under your skin
So far, so far away
Don't you know we could be

[Chorus: Amy Lee]
High or Low
You never fell beneath me
And I gave up on you
But I never forgot you

[Verse 2: Amy Lee]
I can't be your friend
Hold your hand while you bleed
There's nothing left to give you
Nothing more I need
Time to let it sleep
Oh, the damage was real
But nothing cut me so deep I could not heal
Don't you know we could be

But it's killing me to go on without you

The songs lyrics are based off of a short story guitarist Ben Moody had written about an 8-year-old girl who gets trapped in a house after her ball bounces inside and is kept alive through another occupant of the house.

10 years later, she has grown dependent on the man who occupies the house for survival and while she wants to kill the man and escape, she has conflicting thoughts about the situation. On the one hand, she has the chance to finally leave the house if he dies and on the other, the man has been the only person shes known for a decade and is the only constant in an ever-changing house.

The song uses imagery to describe the dream world and help listeners imagine it too. The title of the song is fitting as the dream world that is described only exists in the personas mind and is imaginary.

This song was rerecorded for Fallen, but was initially released on their first EP in 1998.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Paper flowers
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Paper flowers

[Verse 1]
I linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name
Let me stay where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops, as they’re falling, tell a story

[Chorus]
In my field of paper flowers (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And candy clouds of lullaby (Paper flowers)
I lie inside myself for hours (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And watch my purple sky fly over me (Paper flowers)

[Verse 2]
Don't say I'm out of touch
With this rampant chaos, your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I built my own world to escape

[Chorus]
In my field of paper flowers (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And candy clouds of lullaby (Paper flowers)
I lie inside myself for hours (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And watch my purple sky fly over me (Paper flowers)

Oh, how I long for the deep sleep dreaming

Title: My Heart Is Broken
Release Date: October 31, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-my-heart-is-broken-lyrics
Song Description: The second single from Evanescence, My Heart is Broken is inspired by victims of sex trafficking, with singer Amy Lee saying:

As I was writing the song I was putting myself in that place  what would it be like to be trapped? Threatened? Alone? Unable to tell anyone what was happening because youre afraid of what would happen?

A music video was released, an incredibly dramatic narrative, with Lee in an exquisite dress   wandering through a corn field, and ending up in a dimly lit basement playing the piano. A Behind the Video episode was created, with Lee saying:

The song is about being trapped, being in a situation and knowing you need to break free For the video Literally its like creating a world for yourself, an imaginary world you can escape the pains of life At the end of the day youre alone, so its not perfect, and the video ends, Im trying to say you have to break back through reality, its better to feel.

The track wasnt commercially successful, although it did make it to number 36 on the Austrian Singles chart, and number 40 on the US Adult Top 40.

The band later went onto rerecorded the track for their 2017 album, Synthesis, bringing it into its original form: the song was born from a drum loop and a harp.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I will wander 'til the end of time
Torn away from you

[Verse 1]
I pulled away to face the pain
I close my eyes and drift away
Over the fear

[Pre-Chorus]
That I will never find a way
To heal my soul
And I will wander 'til the end of time
Torn away from you

[Chorus]
My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us
From sorrow's hold

[Post-Chorus]
Over my heart

[Verse 2]
I can't go on living this way
But I can't go back the way I came
Chained to this fear

Open your eyes to the light
I denied it all so long
Oh, so long
Say goodbye

Title: Lacrymosa
Release Date: September 25, 2006, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-lacrymosa-lyrics
Song Description: Lacrymosa is a song recorded by Evanescence for their second studio album, The Open Door. The song samples the Lacrimosa sequence from Mozarts Requiem from 1791. Amy Lee said that the song was originally written and intended for the soundtrack of the movie The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, but it was rejected due to its dark sound. The producers of Narnia denied the allegations. Lee further said she wrote it with the films opening scene in mind, but the producers rejected it because they wanted something original, as the song is built around Mozarts Requiem.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Out on your own
Cold and alone again
Can this be what you really wanted
Baby?

[Chorus]
(Lacrimosa)
Blame it on me
(Dies illa)
Set your guilt free
(Lacrimosa)
Nothing can hold you back now
(Dona eis requiem)

[Verse 2]
Now that you're gone
I feel like myself again
Grieving the things I can't repair and
Willing

(Dies illa)
And set your guilt free

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
The more you try to fight it
The more you try to hide it
The more infected, rejected, you feel alone inside it
You know you can't deny it
The world's a little more fucked up every day
I'm gonna save you from it
Together we'll outrun it
Just don't give into the fear
So many things I would'
Ve told you If I knew that I was never gonna see you again

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna lift you up into the light that you deserve
I wanna take your pain into myself so you won't hurt

[Chorus]
Don't you dare surrender
Don't leave me here without you
'Cause I could never
Replace your perfect imperfection

[Verse 2]
The way you look us over
Your counterfeit composure
Pushing again and again and sinking lower and lower
The world is on our shoulders
Do you really know the weight of the words you say?
You want a little of it
You just can't let go of it
You've got an ego to feed
Too late to rise above it
Don't look now but the little girl's got a grenade

Replace your perfect imperfection

[Bridge]
We stand undefined
Can't be drawn with a straight line
This will not be our ending
We are alive, we are alive

[Chorus]
Don't you dare surrender
Don't leave me here without you
'Cause I could never
Replace your perfect imperfection

Don't you dare surrender
I'm still right beside you

Title: Taking Over Me
Release Date: March 4, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-taking-over-me-lyrics
Song Description: Evanescence would never again scale the heights their debut record Fallen propelled them to. When you hear a track like Taking Over Me, an album cut, its clear how they sold 15 million copies of this record. Amy Lees incredible vocals are matched by a heavily produced and flawless guitar riff carrying the message of a person losing their sense of self in an unrequited relationship. Its a track that easily could have been a single.

The song was secretly written about Amy Lees future husband, Josh Hartzler.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You don't remember me but I remember you
I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you
But who can decide what they dream?
And dream I do

[Chorus]
I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live, to breathe
You're taking over me

[Verse 2]
Have you forgotten all I know and all we had?
You saw me mourning my love for you
And touched my hand
I knew you loved me then

[Chorus]
I believe in you (I believe in you)
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live, to breathe
You're taking over me

[Bridge]
I look in the mirror and see your face
If I look deep enough
So many things inside that are just like you are taking over

I don't know that I ever was
All alone, I've waited, all alone
Held it in as I played by your rules
I've been biting my lip, but I'm losing my grip
I'm coming down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
When all the hate burns off
I'm left here with the pain
Behind our vain devices
Are we all the same?
Ooh, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
Change me into something I believe in
Change me so I don't have to pretend

[Verse 2]
Take a breath and try to play along
But I'm a terrible liar

And the party's just begun
Throw the rope, I'm wading through the mud
From your mouth flow a thousand truths
But you know
There's only one

'Cause this is my world, little girl, you'd be lost on your own
Just hating and waiting and saving up

I'll do you a favor and save you if you sign on the line
Don't worry your pretty little head about the future, it's all fine
Whether you're wrong or you're right, doesn't matter, you're not up to the fight
Keeping my head down
'Cause they don't know what I know now

[Chorus]
As empires fall to pieces
Our ashes twisting in the air
It makes me smile to know that
I'm better without you

[Verse 3]
Now look around and remember your friends if you can
Feeding the flames 'til there's no one to blame, it's on your hands
Lost in your lies, pay the price with our lives, you've gone mad
And there's no way out

Please, please, please. Can you stop the fire? (Please, please)
Can you stand to fight her? (Please, please)
You can't stop the fire (Please, please)

[Verse 1]
Please, please forgive me
But I won't be home again
Maybe someday you'll look up
And, barely conscious, you'll say to no one:
"Isn't something missing?"
You won't cry for my absence, I know
You forgot me long ago
Am I that unimportant?
Am I so insignificant?
Isn't something missing?
Isn't someone missing me?

You won't try for me, not now
Though I'd die to know you love me

"Isn't something missing?
Isn't someone missing me?"

[Chorus]
Even though I'm the sacrifice
You won't try for me, not now
Though I'd die to know you love me
I'm all alone
Isn't someone missing me?

And if I bleed, I'll bleed
Knowing you don't care
And if I sleep just to dream of you
I'll wake without you there
Isn't something missing?
Isn't something

Even though I'm the sacrifice
You won't try for me, not now
Though I'd die to know you love me
I'm all alone
Isn't something missing?

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

[Pre-Chorus]
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

[Chorus]
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

[Verse 2]
You used to captivate me by your resonating light
And now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal

And I held your hand through all of these years

It was released as the third commercial single from the album on May 25, 2012. A music video was put together with the help of fans as the band didnt have the budget to make a big, giant old-school Evanescence video.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I've been believing
In something so distant
As if I was human
And I've been denying
This feeling of hopelessness
In me, in me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the promises I made
Just to let you down
You believed in me
But I'm broken

[Chorus]
I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

[Verse 2]
As much as I'd like
The past not to exist
It still does
And as much as I'd like
To feel like I belong here
I'm just as scared as you
You might also like[Chorus]
I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

[Bridge]
Run away
Run away
One day we won't feel
This pain anymore
Take it all away
Shadows of you
'Cause they won't let me go

[Chorus]
'Til I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise
Alone and lost in paradise14Embed

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Give me a reason
Make me whole again
Wounds should become scars but I'm cracked instead
Can't risk believing
That I would stand a chance
Frozen in the doorway, don't wanna leave the past

[Pre-Chorus 1]

What I wouldn't give to be with you
For one more night

What if I can't see your light anymore?
'Cause I've spent too long in the dark
And I'm on my knees without shame begging to believe
But I feel so far from heaven

Wake up to a new day
Break my heart again
Dreaming makes for sweet escape but I can't forget
I'm back at the edge now
I never needed you more

But I feel so far from heaven

[Bridge]
Is anyone out there? Did you give up on us?
Break this silence, I'm crushed under love
I don't wanna lock down, but we've lost so much
Will you forgive me?

If I can't see your light anymore?
'Cause I've spent too long in the dark
And I'm on my knees without shame begging to believe
But I feel so far from heaven

Title: Snow White Queen
Release Date: September 25, 2006, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-snow-white-queen-lyrics
Song Description: This song was the sixth track on Evanescences second studio album, The Open Door.

It is not a frontrunner of popularity on the album, however, it is one of the most personal and dark of Amys songs.

Amy describes a moment in her life when she was stalked by a crazed fan outside of her house, and was forced to spend the night in a hotel. The name Snow White comes from Amys username on the no-longer-active EvThreads, an Evanescence based forum in which original band members were a part of.

The track features slower, darker synth noises, and later leads into a more guitar based rock instrumental.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Stoplight, lock the door
Don't look back
Undress in the dark
And hide from you, all of you

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never know the way your words have haunted me
I can't believe you'd ask these things of me (Ever and ever)
(Ever and ever) You don't know me
(Ever and ever) Now and ever

[Chorus]
"You belong to me
My snow white queen
There's nowhere to run
So let's just get it over
Soon, I know you'll see
You're just like me
Don't scream anymore, my love
'Cause all I want is you"

[Verse 2]
Wake up in a dream
Frozen fear
All your hands on me
I can't scream, I can't scream

My snow white queen
There's nowhere to run
So let's just get it over
Soon, I know you'll see
You're just like me
Don't scream anymore, my love
'Cause all I want is you"

[Bridge]
I can't save your life
Though nothing I bleed for is more tormenting
I'm losing my mind
And you just stand there and stare as my world divides

[Chorus]
"You belong to me
My snow white queen
There's nowhere to run
So let's just get it over
Soon, I know you'll see
You're just like me
Don't scream anymore, my love
'Cause all I want is you"

Song Description: Understanding is a song recorded by Evanescence for their 1998 EP. It is credited as the second song we [the band] ever wrote and described as a ridiculous Goth anthem.

Lyrics:

[Spoken Intro]
You hold the answers deep within your own mind
Consciously, you've forgotten it
That's the way the human mind works
Whenever something is too unpleasant, too shameful for us to entertain, we reject it
We erase it from our memories
But the imprint is always there

[Verse 1]
The pain that grips you
The fear that binds you
Releases life in me
In our mutual
Shame we hide our eyes
To blind them from the truth
That finds a way from who we are
Please don't be afraid
When the darkness fades away
The dawn will break the silence
Screaming in our hearts

[Verse 2]
My love for you still grows
This I do for you
Before I try to fight the truth my final time
You might also like[Spoken]
We're supposed to try and be real
And when you feel alone, you are not together
And that is real

[Chorus 1]
Can't wash it all away
Can't wish it all away
Can't cry it all away
Can't scratch it all away

[Verse 3]
Lying beside you
Listening to you breathe
The life that flows inside of you
Burns inside of me
Hold and speak to me
Of love without a sound
Tell me you will live through this
And I will die for you

[Verse 4]
Cast me not away
Say you'll be with me
For I know I cannot
Bear it all alone
[Spoken]
You're not alone, honey
Never, never

[Chorus 2]
Can't fight it all away
Can't hope it all away
Can't scream it all away
It just won't fade away, no

[Chorus 1]
Can't wash it all away
Can't wish it all away
Can't cry it all away
Can't scratch it all away

[Chorus 3]
(Can't fight it all away)
(Can't hope it all away)
Can't scream it all away
Ooh, it all away
Ooh, it all away

[Spoken Outro]
But the imprint is always there
Nothing is ever really forgotten
(God, please don't hate me
Because I'll die if you do
Because I'll die if you do
Because I'll die if you do
Because I'll die if you do)2Embed

Give up your way
You could be anything
Give up my way
And lose myself?

Not today
That's too much guilt to pay

[Verse 2]

But you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die

I've found my way out

In an interview with Reuters, Amy Lee added that the song was also inspired by her own life:

That song is me talking to myself about not being afraid and coming back to this thing and living the life I was born to live. Sometimes, it takes a lot to do this. And I do love it very much, but there is always that fear of putting yourself under the microscope.

Following its release, What You Want was praised by critics as an album highlight  the track generated positive reviews for its instrumentation, hauntingly powerful vocals, and musical hook. In a review which awarded the single five-out-of-five stars, Rick Florino of Artistdirect concluded:

At the heart of this epic, Lee relays another personal story that impacts intensely, especially as the song breaks during the bridge and her voice takes flight like never before.

Stand and face the unknown (Got to remember who you really are)

Title: End Of The Dream
Release Date: October 11, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-end-of-the-dream-lyrics
Song Description: End of the Dream (alternate legal title: The End of the Dream) is track #9 on Evanescences self-titled album.

The song is about death and afterlife. Amy Lee said the following to Spin:

Its about understanding that this life isnt forever, and how you have to live it, embrace even the pain, before its all over. As much as it hurts, it just means youre alive. So dont be so afraid to get hurt that you miss out on living.

She further said:

End of the Dream is just about life and the end of the dream is death. You know its about the journey and its about, again, this recurring theme of not being afraid and living while youre alive because it doesnt last forever.

The song was later rerecorded for Synthesis, returning it to its original vision.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I found a grave
Brushed off the face
Felt your light
And I remember why I know this place
I found a bird
Closing her eyes
One last time
And I wonder if she dreamed like me

[Chorus]
As much as it hurts
Ain’t it wonderful to feel?
So go on and break your wings
Follow your heart 'til it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

[Verse 2]
I’m not afraid
I pushed through the pain
And I’m on fire
I remember how to breathe again

[Chorus]

Title: Breathe No More
Release Date: January 11, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-breathe-no-more-lyrics
Song Description: Originally recorded for Fallen, Breathe No More is a piano ballad about changing yourself in a relationship in order to please the other person.

Although it didnt make the cut on the album, Amy was hoping to include it on Fallens follow-up.

The song was featured on the soundtrack of Elektra, but it wasnt used in the film.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I've been looking in the mirror for so long
That I've come to believe my soul's on the other side
All the little pieces falling, shatter shards of me
Too sharp to put back together
Too small to matter
But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces
If I try to touch her

[Chorus]
And I bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe no more

[Verse 2]
Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirit's well
Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child
Lie to me, convince me that I've been sick forever
And all of this will make sense when I get better
But I know the difference
Between myself and my reflection
I just can't help but to wonder
Which of us do you love?

[Chorus]
So I bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe, no
Bleed, I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe, I breathe
I breathe no moreYou might also like1Embed

Title: Your Star
Release Date: September 25, 2006, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-your-star-lyrics
Song Description: The eleventh track on The Open Door, Your Star is the hardest thing [Amy] has ever written. The song was written in the hotel room in Portugal when Amy was feeling jet-lagged, weird and tired.

During the bridge, the background choir sings Alma surdo, loucura, onde est seu alma? Loucura, todo sozinho (Portuguese with some grammatical mistakes) which tries to mean Deaf soul, madness, where is its soul? Madness, all alone in English. In correct Portuguese it would be Alma surda, loucura, onde est sua alma? Loucura, toda sozinha.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I can't see your star
I can't see your star
Though I patiently waited, bedside, for the death of today
I can't see your star
The mechanical lights of Lisbon frightened it away

[Chorus]
And I'm alone now
Me and all I stood for
We're wandering now
All in parts and pieces, swim lonely, find your own way out

[Verse 2]
I can't see your star
I can't see your star
How can the darkness feel so wrong?

[Chorus]
And I'm alone now
Me and all I stood for
We're wandering now
All in parts and pieces, swim lonely, find your own way out

[Bridge]
So far away
It's growing colder without your love
Why can't you feel me calling your name?
Can't break the silence
It's breaking me
All my fears turn to rage

And I'm alone now, me

Lyrics:

[Intro]
All that I'm living for
All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore alone at night

[Verse 1]
I can feel the night beginning
Separate me from the living
Understanding me after all I've seen
Piecing every thought together
Find the words to make me better
If I only knew how to pull myself apart

[Chorus]
All that I'm living for
All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore alone at night
All that I'm wanted for
Although I wanted more
Lock the last open door, my ghosts are gaining on me

[Verse 2]
I believe that dreams are sacred
Take my darkest fears and play them
Like a lullaby, like a reason why
Like a play of my obsessions
Make me understand the lesson
So I'll find myself
So I won't be lost again

Guess I thought I'd have to change the world to make you see me
To be the one
I could have run forever
But how far would I have come
Without mourning your love?

[Chorus]
All that I'm living for
All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore alone at night
All that I'm wanted for
Although I wanted more
Lock the last open door, my ghosts are gaining on me

Should I feel like I do?

I will stay forever here with you
My love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death our love goes on

Release Date: November 4, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-field-of-innocence-lyrics
Song Description: Based on a poem written by Ben Moody, Field of Innocence is a song featured on the bands demo album Origin. The song portrays how a person would like to go back to a time where they were naive (probably as a child) and didnt know how harsh life can be sometimes.
Lyrics:

I still remember the world
From the eyes of a child
Slowly those feelings
Were clouded by what I know now

Where has my heart gone
An uneven trade for the real world
Oh I, I want to go back to
Believing in everything and knowing nothing at all

I still remember the sun
Always warm on my back
Somehow it seems colder now

Where has my heart gone
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger
Oh I... I want to go back to
Believing in everything

[Latin hymn:]
Iesu, Rex admirabilis
Et triumphator nobilis
Dulcedo ineffabilis
Totus desiderabilis

Where has my heart gone
An uneven trade for the real world
Oh I... I want to go back to

Move over, if you can
'Cause I never lost my crown

Slave to your insecurity
That's what drove you down in the first place
But you haven't learned a thing
Caught in your thick web of lies
Gonna be the bitch you make me out to be

Oh you better take cover

Take my hand

So by the morning's light
We'll be half way to anywhere
Where love is more than just your name

No one knows who we are there
All I want is to give my life only to you
I've dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore
Let's run away, I'll take you there

Title: Made Of Stone
Release Date: October 11, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-made-of-stone-lyrics
Song Description: Made of Stone is the second track on Evanescences self-titled record. It was one of the first songs written for the bands third album.

Before being reworked in the Nick Raskulinecz recording sessions, the song was very electronic and very different and the remixed version is the closest picture of the early version.

Amy Lee stated:

I feel like its strong and defiant and badass and it only got better when the band started really being involved in it and writing that guitar part and everything about it. I feel like it popped up in a big way when the guys got involved. But Ive always loved that one, I think it has a very cool, dark, sexy quality.

The song was originally worked on the recording sessions with Steve Lillywhite in 2010, but it was scrapped by the label and reworked, along with Swimming Home and Secret Door.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Speak your mind

I can see your lips moving

You will not rise above

I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me

But through my tears breaks a blinding light
Birthing a dawn to this endless night
Arms outstretched, awaiting me
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree
Rest in me and I'll comfort you
I have lived and I died for you

Its about losing someone, you know, to giving up or an addiction, losing somebody, feeling like theyre slipping away and you want them back as a hey, you can do it, get back up off the floor kind of song.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Hollow
Like you don't remember me
Underneath
Everything I guess I always dreamed

[Pre-Chorus]
That I would be
The one to take you away
From all this wasted pain
But I can't save you from yourself

[Chorus]
Don't you want to feel?
Don't you want to live your life?
How much longer are you gonna
Give in to the fear?
Holding you down until you're

[Verse 2]
Frozen
I can't let you fall apart
You don't even know
What you've done to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But I would be
The one to take you away
From all this wasted pain
If you could just wake up
You might also like[Chorus/Bridge]
Don't you want to feel?
Don't you want to live your life?
How much longer are you gonna
Give in to the fear?
Holding you down until you're

[Bridge]
All alone
All alone and drowning in your past
Take it back
Take it back, I still believe you can

[Chorus]
Don't you want to feel?
Don't you want to live your life?
How much longer are you gonna
Give in to the fear?
I can't go on pretending
So give me something real
No one in your way but you
How much longer are you gonna
Give in to the fear?
Holding you down 'till you disappear

[Outro]

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Serve your twisted enemy
So you might earn forgiveness
You know your whole world is waiting
So why can’t you speak?

[Chorus]
I feel it coming over me
I’m still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything?
Or just a new way to bleed?

[Verse 2]
So go and tell all your friends
That I’m a failure underneath
If it makes you feel like a bigger man
But it’s my, my heart, my life
That you're calling a lie
I’ve played this game before
And I can’t take anymore

[Chorus]
I feel it coming over me
I’m still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything?
Or just a new way to bleed?

Is this the end of everything?
Or just a new way to bleed?6Embed

Title: Lacrymosa (Synthesis)
Release Date: October 27, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-lacrymosa-synthesis-lyrics
Song Description: This is the Synthesis reworking of Lacrymosa, the third promo single off the album.

Lyrics:

I can't change who I am

Out on your own
Cold and alone again
Can this be what you really wanted, baby?

Now that you're gone
I feel like myself again
Grieving the things I can’t repair and willing

To let you blame it on me
And set your guilt free
I don’t want to hold you back now, love

I can’t change who I am
Not this time, I won’t lie to keep you near me
And in this short life
There’s no time to waste on giving up
My love wasn’t enough

And you can blame it on me
And set your guilt free
I don’t want to hold you back now, loveYou might also like3Embed

Title: Swimming Home
Release Date: October 11, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-swimming-home-lyrics
Song Description: Swimming Home is the closing track (for the standard edition) of the bands self-titled record. Its the only track on the standard edition of the album to include harp. According to Amy Lee, its the truest picture of a creative phase in which everything was more ethereal and driven by programming.

In an track-by-track interview, Lee said:

Its goodbye, its sort of from the other side of the song before. Its like from the persons perspective thats moving on to the next life. But its peaceful, its an acceptance of that giant crazy thing that fascinates me, that I wonder about and think about. And its like, life and death and what comes after, you know and what does it all mean. So its that acceptance and peaceful feeling like the calm after the storm.

The song was originally written for the soundtrack of 2008 Japanese animated fantasy movie Ponyo, but it wasnt accepted.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Way down
I’ve been way down
Underneath this skin
Waiting to hear my name again

[Chorus]
I’m sorry
Nothing can hold me
I adore you still
But I hear them calling
And nothing can hold me

[Verse 2]
Way down
(Do you really want me?)
All the way down
(Do you really want me here?)
I will hear your voice
(Do you really want me?)
But I’ll no longer understand
(But it's really not me here)

[Chorus]
I’m sorry
Nothing can hold me
I adore you still
But I hear them calling

Song Description: Origin version of Where Will You Go, previously released on Evanescence EP in 1998.

This version uses electronic sound effects and has a quicker tempo, whereas the EP version is more of a confessional setting, with organs in the background.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You're too important for anyone
You play the role of all you long to be
But I, I know who you really are
You're the one who cries when you're alone

[Chorus]
But where will you go
With no one left to save you from yourself
You can't escape
You can't escape

[Verse 2]
You think that I can't see right through your eyes
Scared to death to face reality
No one seems to hear your hidden cries
You're left to face yourself alone

[Chorus]
But where will you go (where will you go)
With no one left to save you from yourself
You can't escape
The truth
I realize you're afraid (I realize)
But you can't abandon everyone
You can't escape
You don't want to escape

With no one left to save you from yourself
You can't escape
The truth
I realize you're afraid (I realize)
But you can't reject the whole world
You can't escape
You can't escape
You can't escape
You don't want to escape1Embed

Title: Imaginary (Origin)
Release Date: November 4, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-imaginary-origin-lyrics
Song Description: Early version of Imaginary, which was later re-recorded on the bands debut album, Fallen.

The song uses imagery to describe the dream world and help listeners imagine it too. The title of the song is fitting as the dream world that is described only exists in the personas mind and is imaginary.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights
Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
The goddess of imaginary light

[Chorus]
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me

[Verse 2]
I linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name
Let me stay
Where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story

[Chorus]
If you need to leave the world you live in
Lay your head down and stay a while
Though you may not remember dreaming
Something waits for you to breathe again

[Break]

Title: Together Again
Release Date: February 23, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-together-again-lyrics
Song Description: Written during the Open Door era, Together Again is a song written for the first Narnia film, but the directors of the film said no Evanescence music was planned for the soundtrack.

In order to help raise funds for the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Evanescence joined UN Haiti Relief Effort to release Together Again. If you donated five US dollars, you would download the song right away. It raised over $31,000 in its first week of availability.

The song was performed, for the first time, in its orchestral version on the 2018 Synthesis tour.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Never thought that I'd be leaving you today
So alone and wondering why I feel this way
So wide the world
Can love remember how to get me home to you
Someday?

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
We'll be together again
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
All just a dream in the end
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
We'll be together again
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
So many fears were swimming
Around and around in my mind (Around and around in my mind)
Who would have dreamed the secrets
We would find?

[Verse 3]
I've found a world
Where love and dreams and darkness all collide
Maybe this time
We can leave our broken world behind

Song Description: Erase This is track #6 on Evanescences self-titled album. Its working titles were Vanilla and Sharkfin Backpack.

Amy Lee said that they couldnt come up with a chorus for a song, and producer Nick Raskulinecz had the idea to combine the verse and chorus from two separate songs together, making Erase This.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It’s too late to change your mind
Even though this fragile world is tearing apart at the seams
I can’t wash these sins away
This sinking feeling everyday I’m waking up in someone else’s life

[Chorus]
Is it so hard for you?
'Cause it’s so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed could ever come to life again
'Cause I cannot erase this lie

[Verse 2]
Not gonna let this day go by
I’m gonna save this wasted life
And nothing can stand in my way
Not enough to say goodbye
Burn it till there’s nothing left
I’m drowning in the mess that I have made

[Chorus]
Is it so hard for you?
'Cause it’s so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed could ever come to life again
'Cause I cannot erase this darkness in me

If I could just erase my mind

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down, into my core

My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there, and lead it, back, home

[Chorus]
Wake me up inside!
Wake me up inside!
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

[Chorus]
Wake me up inside!
Wake me up inside!

Bid my blood to run

Title: Forgive Me
Release Date: August 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-forgive-me-lyrics
Song Description: Forgive Me is the fourth track on Evanescences second EP released in 1999. Lyrically, its about asking forgiveness for a mistake one made.

Ben Moody stated that it was a private song, but it ended up on the bands EP.
Lyrics:

Can you forgive me again?
I don't know what I said
But I didn't mean to hurt you

I heard the words come out
I felt that I would die
It hurt so much to hurt you

Then you look at me
You're not shouting anymore
You're silently broken

I'd give anything now
To kill those words for you
Each time I say something I regret I cry "I don't want to lose you."
But somehow I know that you will never leave me, yeah

Cause you were made for me
Somehow I'll make you see
How happy you make me

I can't live this life
Without you by my side
I need you to survive
So stay with me
You look in my eyes
And I'm screaming inside that I'm sorry

Title: Oceans
Release Date: October 11, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-oceans-lyrics
Song Description: Inspired by nature, Oceans is the tenth track on Evanescences self-titled album. Its a song with a big, low synth and a vocal, then the band kicks in. Its big and lush as described by Amy Lee.

In a track-by-track interview, Lee said:

 I think [its] a really cool song with some taste of a new direction, but at the same time it totally claims that Evanescence feeling. [] I feel like its different sounding and I kind of been falling in love with a lot of old analog gear for the last couple of years. So it was fun to get to use those things.

It was premiered live in 20 August 2011 in Winnipeg, Canada at the bands first show from the self-titled era.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Don't want to be the one to walk away
But I can't bear the thought of one more day
I think I finally understand what it means to be lost

[Verse 2]
Can't find the road to lead us out of this
A million miles from where we burned the bridge
Can't keep pretending everything's gonna be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
With the whole world
Falling around me

[Chorus]
(Oh)
Cross the oceans in my mind
(Oh-oh)
Find the strength to say goodbye
(Oh)
In the end you never can wash the blood
From your hands

[Verse 3]
Fallen so far from where we were before
You'll never find what you've been searching for
Something to fill the void and make up for all of those
Missing pieces of you

So we fall down again
Heaven, help me find a way to dream
Within this nightmare

Song Description: Recorded during the 2001-2002 demo sessions, Before the Dawn is a song about two or more strongly-connected people planning to leave or escape to another location.

David Hodges was hoping this song would be on Fallen, but it didnt really fit the idea of the record.

Lyrics:

Meet me after dark again and I'll hold you
I am nothing more than to see you there
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn
If only night could hold you where I can see you, my love
Then let me never ever wake again
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn

Somehow I know that
We can't wake again
From this dream
It's not real but it's ours

Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn

Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away

Title: October
Release Date: 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-october-lyrics
Song Description: October is an outtake from Evanescence EP, the bands first EP released in 1998.

Theres some controversy among fans about a supposedly gospel nature of this composition, due to verses that are typical of devotional hymns I fall into your abounding grace, for example, although no explicit reference to Jesus or Lord or God is made in the song.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I can't run anymore
I fall before you
Here I am
I have nothing left
Though I've tried to forget
You're all that I am
Take me home
I'm through fighting it
Broken
Lifeless
I give up
You're my only strength
Without you
I can't go on
Anymore
Ever again

[Chorus]
My only hope
(All the times I've tried)
My only peace
(To walk away from you)
My only joy
My only strength
(I fall into your abounding grace)
My only power
My only life
(And love is where I am)
My only love

Title: End of the Dream (Synthesis)

Song Description: This is the Synthesis reworking of The End of the Dream, a song about enjoying life the most you can and the end of the dream being death. It was previously released on Evanescences third, self-titled album.

This version retains its original vision musically, because the song was originally built around programming, synths and loops. Amy said: Theres just a drone and singing and it feels so good to just start the song off that way and just go into that place and take my time with it and let the song unravel into something bigger.
Lyrics:

I found a grave
Brushed off the face
Felt your light
And I remember why I know this place
I found a bird
Closing her eyes
One last time
And I wonder if she dreamed like me

As much as it hurts
Ain’t it wonderful to feel?
So go on and break your wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream

I’m not afraid
I pushed through the pain
And I’m on fire
I remember how to breathe again

As much as it hurts
Ain’t it wonderful to feel?
So go on and break your wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream
You might also likeWhy must we fall apart to understand how to fly?
I will find a way even without wings

My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
How many times have you told me you love her
As many times as I've wanted to tell you the truth
How long have I stood here beside you
I live through you
You looked through me

[Chorus]
Ooh, Solitude
Still with me is only you
Ooh, Solitude
I can't stay away from you

[Verse 2]
How many times have I done this to myself
How long will it take before I see
When will this hole in my heart be mended
Who now is left alone but me

[Chorus]
Ooh, Solitude
Forever me and forever you
Ooh, Solitude
Only you, only true

[Verse 3]
Everyone leaves me stranded
Forgotten, abandoned, left behind
I can't stay here another night
Your secret admirer
Who could it be
Ooh, Can't you see
All along it was me
How can you be so blind
As to see right through me

Say you will or say you won't
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real, is this real?

And I can't take anymore
Tell me what you want from me or leave me alone

And I've held your hand through all of these years

Monsters calling my name
Let me stay where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops as they’re falling tell a story

In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me

Don’t say I’m out of touch
With this rampant chaos, your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I built my own world to escape

In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me

Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights
Oh, how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
The goddess of imaginary light

This song was written on tour while the band was in Lisbon, Portugal, and Amy Lee was feeling jet-lagged, weird and tired.
Lyrics:

I can't see your star
I can't see your star
Though I patiently waited
Bedside for the death of today
I can't see your star
The mechanical lights of Lisbon frightened it away

And I'm alone now
Me and all I stood for
We're wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way out

I can't see your star
I can't see your star
How can the darkness feel so wrong?

And I'm alone now
Me and all I stood for
We're wandering now
All in parts and pieces, swim lonely
Find your own way out

So far away
It's growing colder
Without your love
Why can't you feel me
Calling your name?
Can't break the silence
It's breaking me
You might also likeAll my fears turn to rage

And I'm alone now, me
And all I stood for
We're wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way out

Nothing worth fighting for
We're wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way outEmbed

Title: Lost in Paradise (Synthesis)
Release Date: November 10, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Evanescence-lost-in-paradise-synthesis-lyrics
Song Description: This is the Synthesis reworking of Lost in Paradise, originally released on the bands third, self-titled album.

Amy Lee describes it as being almost an apology to the fans, for being gone (since the end of The Open Door tour).
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I've been believing
In something so distant
As if I was human
And I've been denying
This feeling of hopelessness
In me, in me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the promises I made
Just to let you down
You believed in me, but I'm broken

[Chorus]
I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

[Verse 2]
As much as I'd like the past not to exist
It still does
And as much as I'd like to feel like I belong here
I'm just as scared as you

[Chorus]
I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I’m lost in paradise
You might also like[Bridge]
Run away, run away
One day we won't feel this pain anymore
Take it all away, shadows of you
'Cause they won't let me go

[Chorus/Outro]
Till I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise
Alone and lost in paradiseEmbed
