Artist: TOOL
Artist Description: Tool is an enigmatic progressive metal band from Los Angeles, California. Members include vocalist Maynard James Keenan, guitarist Adam Jones, drummer Danny Carey, and bassist Justin Chancellor. Chancellor replaced Paul D'Amour in 1995.

The band emerged with its first (and only) EP, Opiate (1992), and followed that up with their debut studio album, Undertow (1993), during the age of early 1990s grunge, and made their success by headlining Lollapalooza festivals aimed at that genre. After the alternative rock scene receded from the mainstream American ear, Tool continued into art rock and progressive rock, and have since released Ænima (1996), Lateralus (2001) and 10,000 Days (2006), which have gained worldwide critical and commercial success. After much anticipation for a fifth studio album for over 13 years, Fear Inoculum was released on August 30, 2019.

Tool’s approach has been part conviction, part sarcasm. While the band incorporates mathematical and ritualistic themes in their music, they have done so at such a level that their paradoxical belief system has hoodwinked a major part of their fan base. The band diligently utilizes multiple time signatures in all of the more recent releases, arranges their instruments into complex formations, and even incorporates the infamous Fibonacci Sequence in the song “Lateralus.”

However, for over a decade and until it was updated prior to the 2017 tour, Tool’s website offered artsy word-salad band member biographies, creating an indoctrinating, calculated mystique, and has delivered bogus news aimed at cult-like followers who are willing to believe almost anything. Messages or news the band has given, whether directly from the mouth of a band member or indirectly through the media, is meant to be taken with a grain of salt and questioned throughout, which is another ideology the band has preached for many years. Some say Tool’s approach parodies that of their long-time object of ridicule, L. Ron Hubbard and the system of beliefs he created.

Due to Tool’s incorporation of these thematic structures, visual arts (music videos made entirely from claymation), vivid and Grammy-winning album art (contributions from Adam Jones and artist Alex Grey), and very long, complex releases, the band’s sound has been described as style-transcending—a mix of progressive metal, psychedelic rock, and art rock. The relationship between the band and the music industry is ambivalent, marked by censorship and their continued insistence on privacy.

On August 2, 2019, after being held for many years, all of Tool’s music was released for digital streaming and purchase.

Title: Forty Six & 2
Release Date: September 17, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-forty-six-and-2-lyrics
Song Description: The meaning of 46 and 2:

According to Melchizedek, our planet is covered with geometrically constructed morpho genetic grids. These grids extend from about 60 feet under the Earths surface to about 60 miles above the Earth, arranged in geometric patterns (see Sacred Geometry). Each species has its own grid, which supports life, and connects the consciousness of its particular species. Before any species can come into existence or make an evolutionary step, a new grid must be completed. When a species becomes extinct, that particular species' grid dissolves.

A new grid was completed in 1989  the christ-consciousness grid. This grid will allow humans to evolve into our next version. Well develop two additional chromosomes (which are really geometrical images designed to resonate with our specific grid) for a total of 46 + 2.

The main change will be a shift to the "unity consciousness. Every cell in your body has its own consciousness and memory. You, the higher being that occupies your body, make the millions of different consciousnesses in your body work together as one being. How does this relate to this grid? Think of yourself as a cell and the grid as the higher being. We will still have individual consciousness, but will be united in the form of a higher being in order to work as one entity."

The above was copied/pasted from The Tool FAQ G-36.

[Intro]
Join in my—
Join in, my child, and listen
Digging through
My old numb shadow

[Verse 1]
My shadow's shedding skin
I've been picking scabs again
I'm down, digging through
My old muscles, looking for a clue

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been
I've been wallowing in my own confused
And insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in
I wanna feel the changes coming down
I wanna know what I've been hiding

Kill and give and to die

Stretching up and over me
Soften this old armor
Hoping I can clear the way by
Stepping through my shadow
Coming out the other side

Title: Sober
Release Date: April 6, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-sober-lyrics
Song Description: Sober was written about a friend of the band who was only creative when under the influence.  It earned Tool their first real fame in the mid 90s, receiving heavy airplay on radio and MTV as the primary single from Undertow. The track features an eerily repetitive, single-note bass line that repeats through most of the sections, accompanied by Adam Jones' dissonant guitars and Maynard James Keenans unorthodox vocal delivery.

Many of the lyrics were adapted from the song Burn About Out by C.A.D., one of Maynards former bands.

The music video is famous for its use of clay figures and stop-motion animation.

Title: Lateralus
Release Date: May 15, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-lateralus-lyrics
Song Description: Lateralus is one of the most overtly intricate songs by Tool. The predominant lyrical theme is that over-analysis leads to loss of control, linear structures dont exist in nature and that we should embrace the random, and swing on the spirals of our divinity and still be a human.

Ironically, the song, as well as the entire albums, structure was carefully planned; this specific song is based on the Fibonacci sequence:


The introduction section of the song is 01:12 long (0, 1, 1, 2 are the first four numbers in the sequence).
The first verse starts at 97 seconds, which is approximately 1.618 minutes  (The Golden Ratio)

Each verse is 55 seconds long (11th # in sequence).
The syllables in the verses coincide with the sequence, as the first part of the first verse goes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 5, 3
The 2nd line to swing on the spiral finishes at 6:18 which numerically matches 1.618  (The Golden Ratio)

The time signature of the main riff is 9/8 8/8 7/8, 987 is the 17th term in the sequence.





So as a sort of double-standard, this song wants you to embrace the random, but embracing could be interpreted as such for studying its anomalies, which in turn could be found as over analysis.

Title: Ænema
Release Date: September 17, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-nema-lyrics
Song Description: The word nima is a portmanteau of the words Enema and Anima.

An enema is a procedure of introducing liquids into the rectum and colon via the anus. Metaphorically, it could refer to a cleansing of another type, such as the nationwide purging described in this song.

The anima refers to one of two primary anthropomorphic archetypes of the unconscious mind in Carl Jungs school of analytical psychology. In the unconscious of the male, this archetype finds expression as a feminine inner personality: anima; equivalently, in the unconscious of the female it is expressed as a masculine inner personality: animus. It is an archetype of the collective unconscious and it is said to manifest itself by appearing in dreams. It also influences a mans interactions with women and his attitudes toward them and vice versa for females and the animus.

Title: The Pot
Release Date: May 2, 2006, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-the-pot-lyrics
Song Description: The Pot is meticulously written to criticize hypocrisy, mainly targeting the church (Christianity) and the government.

This song comes on the heels of the titular 10,000 Days, a song in which Maynard calls out hypocrisy in the congregations of the church his mother attended. This song, The Pot, can be seen to, in this context, be a response to his own calling out of hypocrisy as hypocrisy  in the words of the common idiom, The pot calling the kettle black. The black kettle is also referenced here to show how the so called God-men killed innocent natives and Chief Black Kettle in the Cheyenne tribe.

On the track, Maynard also changes his vocal style dramatically from that of the prior track 10,000 Days (Wings Pt. 2), suggesting the appearance of another narrator.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Who are you to wave your finger?
You must've been out your head
Eye hole deep in muddy waters
You practically raised the dead
Rob the grave to snow the cradle
Then burn the evidence down
Soapbox house of cards and glass so
Don't go tossin' your stones around
You must've been high
You must've been high

Title: Schism
Release Date: May 15, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-schism-lyrics
Song Description: Schism (dictionary):

A split or division between strongly opposed sections or parties, caused by differences in opinion or belief.

In this song, lead singer Maynard James Keenan describes the effect a schism can have on a relationship when the parties disagree and communications break down.

This song and all of Lateralus came after legal issues with record labels and the success of Maynards other band, A Perfect Circle, which had just started to require a lot more of his time. This song is Tools Come Together in that it is their way of letting fans and even themselves know that, even if they have faced hardships, they can still fit together and create greatness.

Maynard uses a jigsaw puzzle as a metaphor for the relationship.



On the album, the song is introduced by the interlude Mantra. The interlude is included in the music video.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication

[Bridge]
The light that fueled our fire then
Has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end
Crippling our communication

[Verse 2]
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over

But I watched them fall away

Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second-guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication

[Bridge]
Cold silence has a tendency to
Atrophy any sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers

Title: Fear Inoculum
Release Date: August 7, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-fear-inoculum-lyrics
Song Description: Throughout Fear Inoculum, the highly anticipated comeback song from Tool, the speaker seems to be addressing a blight or foe theyve named The Deceiver. He seems to be standing up to him in order to end the misery, fear, hatred, and isolation that hes brought to the speakers life.

The song seems to be a prayer or ritual, with the speaker serving as the exorcist/magician and The Deceiver representing some awful spirit conjured, but now in need of elimination from the speaker.

A theme of chasing away lies, hatred, and isolation through the forceful confrontation of your problems seems to run throughout the whole song.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Immunity, long overdue
Contagion, I exhale you
Naive, I opened up to you
Venom and mania
Now, contagion, I exhale you

The deceiver says, he says
"You belong to me
You don't wanna breathe the light of the others
Fear the light, fear the breath
Fear the others for eternity"

Title: 10,000 Days (Wings, Pt. 2)
Release Date: May 2, 2006, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-10000-days-wings-pt-2-lyrics
Song Description: Wings for Marie parts 1 and 2, as well as all of 10,000 Days, was dedicated to lead singer Maynard James Keenans mother Judith Marie Gridley. She passed away 3 years prior to the release of the album.

When Maynard was 11 years old, his mother suffered a brain aneurysm that left her paralyzed for the remainder of her life. Despite her unfortunate condition, she maintained a strong faith in God. Though Maynard would have odds with her views at times (as exemplified in A Perfect Circles Judith), he espouses in the albums two-part dedication that because of her faith in such a trying episode, she above all others is deserving of Heaven.

The 10,000 days of the albums title refers to the 27 years that Maynards mother lived after being paralyzed.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
We listen to the tales and romanticize
How we'd follow the path of the hero
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun
How we rise to the height of our halo
Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
Our way into the arms of the savior
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations
None of us have actually been there
Not like you

[Verse 2]
Ignorant siblings at the congregation
Gather around spewing sympathy
Spare me
None of them can even hold a candle up to you
Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see
But enough about the collective Judas
Who could deny you were the one who
Illuminated your little piece of the divine?
And this little light of mine, a gift you passed on to me
I'm gonna let it shine to guide you safely on your way
Your way home

[Verse 3]
Oh, what are they gonna do when the lights go down
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
What are they gonna do when the rivers overrun
Other than tremble incessantly?
High is the way, but all eyes are upon the ground
You were the light and the way they'll only read about

Title: Stinkfist
Release Date: September 17, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-stinkfist-lyrics
Song Description: The first track on Tools 1996 album nima.  The theme of this song is about how people will take things to the extreme for pleasure by using fisting as a metaphor.

Because of this, radio and TV stations were not allowed to say the title of the track on the air.  They would instead call it Track #1.  One MTV VJ at the time, Matt Pinfield, the stations metalhead, would sometimes send a signal to the fans by waving his fist in front of his nose when introducing the song.

Title: Rosetta Stoned
Release Date: May 2, 2006, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-rosetta-stoned-lyrics
Song Description: In the song, a character goes through a drug trip in the infamous deserts of Area 51.

Its a long, daunting occurrence especially when the aliens approach him, pick him up and tell him he is the chosen one.

The Rosetta Stone is a Ptolemaic age granodiorite stele inscribed with a decree issued at Memphis in 196 BC on behalf of King Ptolemy V. The decree appears in three scripts: the upper text is Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the middle portion Demotic script, and the lowest Ancient Greek. Because it presents essentially the same text in all three scripts (with some minor differences among them), it provided the key to the modern understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs.

The term Rosetta stone has been used idiomatically to represent a crucial key to the process of decryption of encoded information, especially when a small but representative sample is recognized as the clue to understanding a larger whole.

The title of the song is a play on this term in the context of trying to evolve or discover and understand aliens, much like the Rosetta Stone was used to understand the ancient Egyptians, and of course being stoned/drugged out of your mind as well. It implies that drugs are this characters Rosetta Stone, in other words his key to decoding and understanding this civilization.

In my "need to know" pose, just outside of Area 51
Contemplating the whole "chosen people" thingy
When just then a flaming stealth banana split the sky
Like one would hope but never really expect to see in a place like this
Cutting right angle donuts on a dime
And stopping right at my Birkenstocks
And me yelping, "holy fucking shit"
Holy fucking shit
Holy fucking shit
Holy fucking shit
Holy fucking shit
Holy fucking shit
Holy fucking shit

[Verse 2]
Then the X-File being
Looking like some kind of blue-green Jackie Chan
With Isabella Rossellini lips, and breath that reeked of
Vanilla Chig Champa
Did a slow-mo Matrix descent
Outta the butt end of the banana vessel
And hovered above my bug-eyes, my gaping jaw
And my sweaty L. Ron Hubbard upper lip
And all I could think was
"I hope Uncle Martin here doesn't notice
That I pissed my fuckin' pants"

So light in his way, like an apparition, that
He had me crying out
"Fuck me, it's gotta be
The Deadhead Chemistry
The blotter got right on top of me
Got me seein' E-motherfuckin'-T"

[Verse 4]
And after calming me down
With some orange slices
And some fetal spooning
E.T. revealed to me his singular purpose
He said, "You are the chosen one
The one who will deliver the message
A message of hope for those who choose to hear it
And a warning for those who do not"
Me, the chosen one
They chose me
And I didn't even graduate from fuckin' high school
[Refrain]
You'd better
You'd better
You'd better
You'd better listen
[Verse 5]
Then he looked right through me
With somniferous almond eyes
Don't even know what that means
Must remember to write it down
This is so real
Like the time Dave floated away
See, my heart is pounding
'Cause this shit never happens to me

[Verse 6]
I can't breathe right now
It was so real
Like I woke up in Wonderland
All sorta terrifying
I don't wanna be all alone
While I tell this story
And can anyone tell me why
You all sound like Peanuts parents?
Will I ever be coming down?
This is so real
Finally, it's my lucky day
See, my heart is racing
'Cause this shit never happens to me

[Verse 7]
I can't breathe right now
You believe me, don't you?
Please believe what I've just said
See the Dead ain't touring
And this wasn't all in my head
See, they took me by the hand
And invited me right in
Then they showed me something
I don't even know where to begin
[Chorus]
Strapped down to my bed
Feet cold and eyes red
I'm out of my head
Am I alive? Am I dead?
Can't remember what they said
God damn, shit the bed

[Bridge]
Overwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position
Such a heavy burden now to be the one
Born to bear and bring to all the details of our ending
To write it down for all the world to see
But I forgot my pen
Shit the bed again
Typical

[Chorus]
Strapped down to my bed
Feet cold and eyes red
I'm out of my head
Am I alive? Am I dead?
Sunkist and Sudafed
Gyroscopes and infrared
Won't help, I'm brain dead
Can't remember what they said
God damn, shit the bed

I can't remember what they said to me
Can't remember what they said to make me out to be the hero
Can't remember what they said

Title: Parabola
Release Date: May 15, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-parabola-lyrics
Song Description: A parabola is a U-shaped curve in a quadratic function. Parabola is a play on the title of the introduction section, titled Parabol, which is a play on the word parable, or a story with an intended moral lesson. Parables form the foundation for all modern major religions.

Parabola is a celebration of life, the holy experience of birth, and the unlikely opportunity that we all share to be temporarily conscious of each other and the world around us. This song focuses on the realization through our bodily experience that others share the same limitations and desires as we do, and we will all eventually fade back into nothingness, as we were before our births. This realization of our own mortality urges us to treasure the life we have, use it to the best of our ability, and ignore base, unnecessary, unfulfuillable desires that detract from the richness of our experience of life.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
We barely remember
Who or what came before this precious moment
We are choosing to be here right now
Hold on, stay inside

[Pre-Chorus]

Title: The Grudge
Release Date: May 15, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-the-grudge-lyrics
Song Description: The Grudge is a song about maturity and development, using alchemical, astrological, and mythological symbolism.

The planet Saturn has an orbital period of 29.5 years, so it returns to the astral position it occupied at the time of an individuals birth as that individual approaches age 30; a significant and symbolic life moment for many people.

Jungian psychology (which is based mostly on alchemy) similarly defines the transit as a period of transition and maturation into adulthood. This may manifest itself as professional success, establishing a family or the fulfilment of other responsibilities, but it can also be a time of struggle and strife if the individual going through the transit cannot approach the period with the right mindset (letting go of our need to control and hold on to the life we know).

The Grudge portrays an example of the latter: an individual struggling to move on from past wrongs and unable to transcend (or simply grow up) as a result. By the end of the song the answer is very clear, with the repeated injunction to let go.



Tool often incorporates lyrical themes into the musical composition itself. In this case the unusual 5/8 time signature divides The Grudge into units of 10 beats (2 bars) per line, echoing the significance of the number 10 in the lyrics.

A total absence of tempo changes strengthens the effect, although Danny Carey camouflages what might otherwise be a rigid formula with some ingenious drumming. The downbeats/stresses change between different sections (for example, 3+3+4 during the chorus and 5+5 during the let go outro). This alters the pulse and creates contrast between different parts of the song.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate
Desperate to control all and everything
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen

[Verse 1]
Clutch it like a cornerstone
Otherwise, it all comes down
Justify denials and
Grip 'em to the lonesome end
Clutch it like a cornerstone
Otherwise, it all comes down
Terrified of being wrong

Title: Pneuma
Release Date: August 30, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-pneuma-lyrics
Song Description: Pneuma () is an ancient Greek word for breath, and in a religious context for spirit or soul.

This song is a vivid reminder to us that being a human is not bound to the physical being. We are one word, we are one spark beyond this flesh. Also, this Pneuma, soul, spirit or breath is much more important than what we see and experience physically, as in the first lines we are asked to acknowledge it. Then further in the lyrics we Children as in innocents or ignorant about such an important concept, are asked to open our eyes to realize this wonder, to see the big picture, our spirits.

This concept is indeed not new to Maynards lyrics throughout his career and is evident in the abstractions in Lateralus.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
We are spirit bound to this flesh
We go 'round, one foot nailed down
But bound to reach out and beyond this flesh
Become Pneuma

[Chorus]
We are will and wonder, bound to recall, remember
We are born of one breath, one word
We are all one spark, sun becoming

Child, release the light
Wake up now, child

Title: Hooker with a Penis
Release Date: September 17, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-hooker-with-a-penis-lyrics
Song Description: A song in response to fans claiming Tool sold out to the man. The band claims that we are all the man.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
I met a boy wearing Vans, 501s
And a dope Beastie tee, nipple rings, new tattoos
That claimed that he was OGT
Back from '92, from the first EP
And in between sips of Coke
He told me that he thought we were sellin' out
Layin' down, suckin' up to the man

[Chorus]
Well now, I've got some advice for you, little buddy
Before you point your finger, you should know that I'm the man
I'm the man and you're the man and he's the man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass

Title: Invincible
Release Date: May 7, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-invincible-lyrics
Song Description: Invincible is a dynamic rock song that paints an image of seasoned warriors aching for a return to battle, but blinded by Quixotic scenes of glory, they overlook their aging souls. A fairly straightforward lyrical entry for frontman Maynard James Keenan, the songs imagery and historical references of valor could serve as a metaphor for the bands status quo, as they themselves at the far end of their long tenure as a band. In this sense, Invincible carries a pathos of the bands concern with remaining artistically relevant in the music industry and their struggles with the burden of time.

The song has three sections  the song begins with a steady tempo with minimal instrumentation that progresses into an uptempo hard rock arrangement, before venturing into an instrumental part that includes a guitar solo and an electronic section with a strong synth that backs Maynards vocoded voice. The final section is a heavy and fast tempo finale.

The band initially debuted the song with a live performance video, along with the song Descending, to tease the long-anticipated album, while the record was being finalized.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Long in tooth and soul
Longing for another win
Lurch into the fray
Weapon out and belly in

[Pre-Chorus]
Warrior struggling to remain consequential

[Chorus]
Bellow aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am

Beating tired bones again

Song Description: The first single from their 4th full-length studio album, the song features a 5/4 riff and describes the vicarious thrill the public receives from living through others in the media eye. The song reached #2 on the US Billboard Alternative Songs and Mainstream Rock lists and is a playable track on Guitar Hero World Tour.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Eye on the TV, 'cause tragedy thrills me
Whatever flavor it happens to be like
"Killed by the husband"
"Drowned by the ocean"
"Shot by his own son"
"She used a poison in his tea
Then kissed him goodbye"
That's my kind of story
It's no fun 'til someone dies
Don't look at me like I am a monster
Frown out your one face, but with the other
Stare like a junkie into the TV
Stare like a zombie while the mother holds her child
Watches him die
Hands to the sky cryin', "Why, oh why?"

[Chorus]
'Cause I need to watch things die
From a distance

You all need it too, don't lie

Why can't we just admit it?

Title: Prison Sex
Release Date: April 6, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-prison-sex-lyrics
Song Description: With introspection that Maynard seems to bring to the table almost constantly, Prison Sex addresses the psychological, almost procedural impact of abuse on its victims.

The song seems to alternate between the perspective of the abuser and the perspective of the victim. With the differing wording, it brings out both the paralyzing fear expressed by the victim and the twisted mentality of the abuser. In fact, Maynard James Keenan discussed these different interpretations of the song in a 1994 interview with the San Francisco Chronicle.


Q: The Prison Sex video seemed to strike a chord with just about everyone who saw it. What are your impressions of the clip?

A: In a lot of the music youll find open spaces for your own interpretation. In the Prison Sex video you question whether the song is actually being sung from an infants point of view, or from the antagonists point of view. But theres definitely a cycle involved, a push-and-pull.


Although it can be metaphorically translated to match different forms of abuse, the theme in this song revolves around the rape and sexual assault of a young child. The song, as well as its music video, has been the source of a significant amount of controversy due to its symbolic depictions of child abuse and sexual assault: it was pulled from MTVs rotation after only a few rotations. However, it was still nominated for the 1995 MTV Video Award for Best Special Effects.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It took so long to remember just what happened
I was so young and vestal then
You know it hurt me
But I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive

And my head down and my eyes closed
My throat's wide open

Title: Third Eye
Release Date: September 17, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-third-eye-lyrics
Song Description: This song seems to depict forcing a spiritual experience via psychedelics.  The narrator alludes to being on the borderline of a spiritual awakening, and uses some kind of psychedelic to pry open his third eye in order to reconnect with himself.

If taken as a direct narrative of MJKs life, it could be seen as a story of Maynard using psychedelics to confront his traumatic childhood and become whole.  Allusions are made to a younger version of Maynard that are also made throughout Aenima, specifically jimmy.

Ultimately, this song is about forcing some kind of personal awakening or healing through psychedelics.  There is also a tribute to the late comedian Bill Hicks.  It is explained in a hulu documentary titled American: The Bill Hicks Story that Bill had done mushrooms with 2 of his good friends and experienced something life-changing.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Bill Hicks]
"See, I think drugs have done some good things for us, I really do. And if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us, do me a favor - go home tonight and take all your albums, all your tapes, and all your CDs and burn 'em. 'Cause you know what? The musicians who've made all that great music that's enhanced your lives throughout the years... real fucking high on drugs."

"Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather."
"It's not a war on drugs, it's a war on personal freedom, that's what it is, okay? Keep that in mind at all times, thank you."

[Verse 1]
Dreaming of that face again
It's bright and blue and shimmering
Grinning wide
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes

[Verse 2]
On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again (And back again)
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye

[Refrain]
In, out, in, out, in, out

[Verse 3]
A child's rhyme stuck in my head
It said that life is but a dream
I've spent so many years in question

[Verse 4]
Shrouding all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me
Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun
I stick my hand into the shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been
I do not recognize the vessel
But the eyes seem so familiar
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song

Title: Eulogy
Release Date: September 17, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-eulogy-lyrics
Song Description: There is much speculation among Tool fans who this song is about, with no theory having been officially confirmed. Candidates include Jesus of Nazareth, due to references to crucifixion and martyrdom; L. Ron Hubbard, the science fiction author who invented Scientology; a past aspect of Maynards personality; and even Bill Hicks, to whom the album was dedicated and whose voice appears elsewhere on the album.

There is by far the most evidence to support L. Ron Hubbard, especially with the reference to 912 (the address number of two Scientology-owned buildings). However, we as listeners shouldnt rule out the possibility of the songs lyrics dealing with multiple figures.
Lyrics:

He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say, we'll miss him
We'll miss him
He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say, we'll miss him
We'll miss him
We're gonna miss him
We're gonna miss him
So long
We wish you well
You told us how you weren't afraid to die
Well, so long
Don't cry
Or feel too down
Not all martyrs see divinity
But at least you tried

Standing above the crowd
He had a voice that was strong and loud, we'll miss him
We'll miss him
Ranting and pointing his finger
At everything but his heart, we'll miss him
We'll miss him
We're gonna miss him
We're gonna miss him

To recall
What it was that you had said to me
Like I care at all
But it was so loud
And you sure could yell
You took a stand on every little thing
And it was so loud

You could be the one who saves me from my own existence
Warn while some child might chill, nine-one-two
I'm too smart when you're invisible by the bone symbol on you
So he bashes his skull through the window while looking out to the sea
Like torment of my ego
And we're amused by this

Yeah, standing above the crowd
He had a voice that was strong and loud and I
Swallowed his facade 'cause I'm so
Eager to identify with
Someone above the ground
Someone who seemed to feel the same
Someone prepared to lead the way, and
Someone who would die for me
Will you?
Will you now?
Would you die for me?
Don't you fuckin' lie
Don't you step out of line
Don't you step out of line
Don't you step out of line
Don't you fuckin' lie

You've claimed all this time that you would die for me
Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?

He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say
He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say

Come down
Get off your fuckin' cross
We need the fuckin' space
To nail the next fool martyr

To ascend you must die
You must be crucified
For our sins and our lies

Title: H.
Release Date: September 17, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-h-lyrics
Song Description: This talks about MJKs experiences as a new parent. Maynard has in many songs referred to the abuse he experienced when he was younger. Here he talks about the feelings that haunt him and how this has affected the relationship with his own son, Devo H. Keenan.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
What's coming through is alive
What's holding up is a mirror
But what's singing songs is a snake, it is
Lookin' to turn my piss to wine
They're both totally void of hate, and
Killin' me just the same

[Refrain]
The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again
And I feel this coming over like a storm again
Considerately

[Verse 2]
Venomous voice, tempts me
And drains me, bleeds me
Leaves me cracked and empty
Drags me down like some sweet gravity

Without the skin, here

The walls came down
Once the snake is drowned
And as I look in his eyes
My fear begins to fade

Title: 7empest
Release Date: August 30, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-7empest-lyrics
Song Description: This song is a reckoning with those that use their influence to control the mainstream narrative, telling the masses everything will be fine; they lull us in with their ruse promising tranquility, while it is plain for all to see that a storm is coming.

All the while not being accountable for their actions.

When caught in their lies, they act all surprised and their Teflon coat deflects the blame to the next bastard in line.

In the end, their control is just a delusion, they are victim of their own certainty and unable to question what they think to be true, hence not being able to ever grow.

In the end, the tempest will be blameless, and no feeble word or atonement will stop it.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Keep, keep
Keep, keep, keep it calm
Keep, keep calm
Keep, keep it, keep it calm
Keep, keep calm
Keep, keep, keep calm
Fuck, here we go again

[Verse 1]
Heat lightning flash, but don't blink
Misleading, tranquility ruse
You're gonna happen again
That's what I think
Follow the evidence
Look it dead in the eye, you are darkness
Trying to lull us in, before the havoc begins
Into a dubious state of serenity
Acting all surprised when you're caught in the lie
We know better
It's not unlike you
It's not unlike you
We know your nature

[Verse 2]
Blame it all on the bastards when you're blowing out
Shame on you, shame on you now
No amount of wind could begin to cover up
Your petulant stench and demeanor
Calm as cookies and cream, so it seems
We're not buying your dubious state of serenity
Acting all surprised when you're caught in the lie
We know better
It's not unlike you

Title: Descending
Release Date: August 30, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-descending-lyrics
Song Description: Descending is a winding progressive rock piece, with passionate vocal passages and heavy guitar solos.  The band had been teasing the song for almost a decade during live performances, and originally released the finished song live on the first show of their 2019 tour, along with Invincible

This song seems to be a desperate call to action to save the human race from self-inflicted doom.  The narrator describes us as being stuck within a madness of our own making,  and quite passionately expresses the need for us to rise up and take action- lest we cease to be.

These themes are not new for songwriter Keenan, as similar writings on a disillusioned humanity can be heard on the album Eat the Elephant by A Perfect Circle, a side project of Keenans.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Free fall through our midnight
This epilogue of our own fable
Heedless in our slumber
Floating nescient, we

[Verse 2]
Free fall through this boundlessness
This madness of our own making
Falling isn't flying
Floating isn't infinite

[Pre-Chorus]
Come, our end, suddenly
All hail our lethargy
Concede suddenly

Pray we mitigate the ruin

Title: Pushit
Release Date: September 17, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-pushit-lyrics
Song Description: Pushit is the 11th track on Tools 1996 sophomore effort nima, and its title is a combination of the words push and shit. One of their more lengthy and heavy tracks, it has been played mostly in Tools live shows pre-Lateralus, often interchanged with the version found on Salival.

Both this song and Schism seem to tackle the subject of a difficult relationship quite clearly. In this instance, only one part seems to find the relationship difficult, and they are self-diagnosing the problem while lacking the courage to tell the partner.

The self-diagnosis happens mostly during the first half of the song; as the song progresses it seems like this person is becoming more and more numb; on the final part of the song they have entirely given up and survival seems to be the only reason they have to go on.
Lyrics:

While you were begging me to stay

And if when I say I might fade like a sigh if I stay
You minimize my movement anyway

Title: The Patient
Release Date: May 15, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-the-patient-lyrics
Song Description: This song is written from the perspective of MJKs mother. She has been paralyzed since 1976. In this song we see his mother battling not only with herself, her illness and the way it affects the ones she loves (referred to in the beginning) as the fearful but also her faith.

In the song there are multiple instances where she questions whats happening to her and Gods masterplan and how it can be that this is the path that was chosen for her.

His mother being paralyzed is a recurring theme for MJK and can also be heard about in 10,000 Days (Wings pt. 2) and Wings For Marie (Part 1).
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
A groan of tedium escapes me
Startling the fearful
Is this a test? It has to be
Otherwise, I can't go on
Draining patience, drain vitality
This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old

[Verse 2]
But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith
And I'm still right here
But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith
And I'm still right here

Title: Reflection
Release Date: May 15, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-reflection-lyrics
Song Description: Reflection is the second song of three indicated as connected by the artwork on the back of the sleeve for the album.



It consists of the three tracks Disposition, Reflection, and Triad.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I have come curiously close to the end, though
Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole
Defeated
I concede and move closer
I may find comfort here
I may find peace within the emptiness
How pitiful
It's calling me (Calling me)
It's calling me (Calling me)
It's calling me (Calling me)
It's calling me

[Verse 2]
And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping
The moon tells me a secret, a confidant
As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me
The source is bright and endless
She resuscitates the hopeless
Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting
And as I pull my head out, I am without one doubt
Don't want to be down here soothing my narcissism, I
Must crucify the ego before it's far too late
I pray the light lifts me out

And leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical
And you will come to find that we are all one mind
Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable
So let the light touch you so that the words spill through
And let the past break through, bringing out our hope and reason

Title: Wings For Marie, Pt. 1
Release Date: May 2, 2006, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-wings-for-marie-pt-1-lyrics
Song Description: Wings for Marie parts 1 and 2, as well as all of 10,000 Days, was dedicated to lead singer Maynard James Keenans mother Judith Marie Gridley.  She passed away 3 years prior to the release of the album.

When Maynard was 11 years old, his mother suffered a brain aneurysm that left her paralyzed for the remainder of her life. Despite her unfortunate condition, she maintained a strong faith in God. Though Maynard would have odds with her views at times (as exemplified in A Perfect Circles Judith), he espouses in the albums two-part dedication that because of her faith in such a trying episode, she above all others is deserving of Heaven.

The 10,000 days of the albums title refers to the 27 years that Maynards mother lived after being paralyzed.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
You
You believed
You believed in movements none could see
You believed in me

[Verse 1]
A passionate spirit
Uncompromised
Boundless and open
A light in your eyes
Then immobilized

[Refrain]
Broken, broken
Fell at the hands of those movements that I wouldn't see
Yet it was you who prayed for me
So what have I done
To be a son to an angel?
What have I done
To be worthy?

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescents
Difficult to see you in this light
Please forgive this selfish question, but
What am I to say to all these ghouls tonight?
"She never told a lie, well, might have told a lie
But never lived one
Didn't have a life, didn't have a life
But surely saved one"

Song Description: Maynard James (Jimmy) Keenan  was eleven years old when his mother was affected by an aneurysm that rendered her paralyzed for the rest of her life. The song is about the pain and fear and other things to follow in the wake of that.
Lyrics:

The face of your own stability
Suddenly look away
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?
Eleven and she was gone
Eleven is when we waved goodbye
Eleven is standing still (Waiting for me)
Waiting for me to free him by
Coming home

Moving me with a sound
Opening me within a gesture
Drawing me down and in
(Showing me where it all began)
Showing me where it all began
Eleven
He was too scarred to realize
You were the voice that's been calling me back home

[Verse 3]
Under a dead Ohio sky
Eleven has been and will be waiting
Defending his light and wondering
Where the hell have I been?

As soon as pain allows so we can

Title: Parabol
Release Date: May 15, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-parabol-lyrics
Song Description: This song is a prelude to the song Parabola on Tools third studio album Lateralus. It is lyrically very similar to Parabola and serves as a more calm opener to the heavier sound of Parabola. The song describes human existence and our own spirit and bodies in an eternal sense. It illustrates the idea that life is just a place to prepare our spirits for some kind of eternal cycle or state of being, whatever that may be.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
So familiar and overwhelmingly warm
This one, this form I hold now
Embracing you, this reality here
This one, this form I hold now, so
Wide eyed and hopeful
Wide eyed and hopefully wild
We barely remember what came before this precious moment
Choosing to be here right now
Hold on, stay inside
This body holding me
Reminding me that I am not alone in
This body makes me feel eternal

Title: Die Eier von Satan
Release Date: September 17, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-die-eier-von-satan-lyrics
Song Description: A heavy industrial guitar played over a reversed drum beat in compound triple meter. The lyrical component of the song is in German, performed by Marko Fox, a member of ZAUM. He is backed by a sound that resembles a hydraulic press, and crowd cheering and applause that increase in volume as the lyrics are read with increasing ferocity. These combined effects make the song sound like a militant German rant or Nazi rally.

The joke is that, although it sounds like a Nazi rally, and the word Satan is in the title, the lyrics are not aggressive or violent in any way. To the contrary, they are actually a recipe for cookies (Hashish or Mexican cookies.)

A possible interpretation is that the cookies placed in an oven are a metaphor for Jews, while the eggs, or lack thereof, stand for African Americans.  The spiked food represents having bad taste in the eyes of those who are not keen on the bands sense of humor and are likely to take it out of context.
Lyrics:

Title: Opiate
Release Date: March 10, 1992, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-opiate-lyrics
Song Description: A huge satire of religion.

The song (and album) get their title from a Karl Marx quote:

Die Religion  ist das Opium des Volkes

(Religion is the opiate of the masses)

In other words, religion acts as a drug for society. It pacifies and dazzles people without actually providing anything of real substance. Heres more reading material for you.

Tool would later reimagine the track in 2022, to celebrate Opiates 30th anniversary
Lyrics:

Over time, prejudices and mental shorthands can be created. These lead to assumptions and stubbornness, even cognitive dissonance  all the while not being able to change their minds when confronted with something that goes against their beliefs.

Internal dialogue is natural but risks reinforcing destructive behaviors if we are not open to change.
But imagined conversations or discussions with oneself or others should not be the base of peoples decisions, for they are not true.

In a society where people are losing sense of community, becoming more individualistic as days go by, this internal dialogue is only being reinforced by the narrative being pushed by all forms of mainstream media on both sides of the divide via social media platforms: knee jerk reactions are abundant as we congregate in increasingly more tribal group identities and adopting a black or white type of reasoning.

This leads to increasing levels of conflict and violence, first in the form of words  as we can see in a world overwhelmed by manufactured outrage thanks to clickbait-fueled identitarian political agendas  manifesting in physical violence: both sides standing their ground, adopting a defensive stance instead of being able to look at their own faults.

Title: Message to Harry Manback
Release Date: September 17, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-message-to-harry-manback-lyrics
Song Description: Message to Harry Manback is an actual voice message on former Green Jell member Gary Helsinger (Hotsy Menshot)s answering machine. The man in the recording was Garys roommate, but Gary kicked him out of his apartment for stealing another roommates belongings. As the message shows, he did not take it well.

Gary was actually roommates with Tool members Maynard James Keenan and Danny Carey, and was later roommates with both Maynard and Billy Howerdel from A Perfect Circle.

The man in the recording has identified himself as Francesco Sonoyo, who didnt find out about the song until the late 2010s. He seems to have taken it all in stride, though, and even wrote a book about it called The Legend of Harry Manback.

Harry Manback is a reference to a routine from the late comedian Bill Hicks.
Lyrics:

Figlio di puttana, sai che tu sei un pezzo di merda.
Hmm? You think you're cool, right? Hmm? Hmm?
When you kicked out people out of the house.
I tell you this, one of three Americans is dying out of cancer.
You know? Asshole. You're gonna be one of those.
I didn't have the courage to kick your ass directly.
Don't have enough courage for that.
I could, you know?
You know you're gonna have another accident?
You know I'm involved with black magic?
Fuck you. Die. Bastard.
You think you're so cool, hmm? Asshole.
And if I ever see your fucking face around, in Europe or Italy
Well, I'll—that time I'm gonna kick your ass.
Fuck you. Fucking Americans. Yankee.
You're gonna die outta cancer, I promise.
Deep pain. No one did what you did to me.
You wanna know something? Fuck you.
I want your balls mashed. Eat shit. Bastard.
Pezzo di merda, figlio di puttana.
I hope somebody in your family dies soon.

Title: Ticks & Leeches
Release Date: May 15, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-ticks-and-leeches-lyrics
Song Description: Off of Lateralus, this thinly-veiled allegory denounces record executives and the music industry for taking advantage of artists' effort and sacrifices. Here, such individuals are compared to parasites for demanding more while giving nothing.

This song is rarely performed live due to the many prolonged screaming sections (including one lasting over a minute).
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Suck and suck
Sucking up all you can
Sucking up all you can suck and suck
Working up under my patience like a little tick
Fat little parasite
Suck me dry
My fruit is bruised and borrowed
You thieving bastards
You have turned my blood cold and bitter
Beat my compassion black and blue

[Chorus]
Hope this is what you wanted
Hope this is what you had in mind
'Cause this is what you're getting
I hope you're choking
I hope you choke on this
I hope you're choking

Taken all I can, taken all I can, I can take
Taken all you can, taken all you can, we can take

Title: Undertow
Release Date: April 6, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-undertow-lyrics
Song Description: The Tool FAQ offers this explanation of the lyrics:

Undertow is a song about repeated drug use. The voice that he hears is some sort of craving for this drug (or something), it suggests nice things to him, and beckons him. When it surrounds and drowns and wipes him away, he is obviously succumbing to this drug. Then, he regains his senses and asks How could I let this bring me back to my knees? realizing that this thing isnt good for him  The undertow represents the state of being under the influence, euphoria has its obvious meaning.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Two times in
I've been struck dumb by a voice that
Speaks from deep beneath peerless water that's
Twice as clear as heaven
Twice as loud as reason
Deep and rich like silt on a riverbed
Just as never ending
Current's mouth below me
Opens up around me
Suggests and beckons all while swallowing
Surrounds and drowns and wipes me away
But I'm so comfortable, so comfortable

[Chorus]
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
You're saturating me
How could I let this bring me
Back to my knees?

[Verse 2]
Third time in
I've been baptized by your voice that
Screams from deep beneath the cold black water that's
Half as high as heaven
Half as clear as reason
Cold and black like silt on the riverbed
Just as never ending
Current's mouth below me
Opens up around me
Suggests and beckons all while swallowing
Surrounds and drowns and wipes me away
But I'm so comfortable, so comfortable

Title: Intolerance
Release Date: April 6, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-intolerance-lyrics
Song Description: Intolerance is the first song on Tools first full-length studio LP.  The songs intro consists of what some claim to be the sound of a scuba tank running out of air, someone drowning, or even someone hitting a water pipe.  Regardless of the true origin of the intro noise, it is water related, and is therefore undeniably related to the title of the album, Undertow.

The lyrics focus on the narrator trying to come to terms with how sinful and intolerable he deems people to be, including himself.  It could be that the repeated phrase during the chorus You lie, cheat and steal is in reference to the lyricist Maynard James Keenans time in the military.  Maynard spent time at West Point academy, whos honor code states We will not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate anyone who does.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be hostile
I don't wanna be dismal
And I don't wanna rot in an apathetic existence
See, I wanna believe you
And I wanted to trust you
And I wanna have faith to put away the dagger

[Chorus]
But you lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
And I tolerate you
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
I cannot tolerate

Title: Disgustipated
Release Date: April 6, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-disgustipated-lyrics
Song Description: A portmanteau of disgust and constipated (obviously).

Another religious satire.

At 15:47, Disgustipated was as of its release the longest song in Tools discography, even though only half of it contains actual music while the other half contains quiet ambiance and spoken monologues. The length has since been surpassed.

The tracks main rhythm comes from audio of a grand piano being blasted by a shotgun.
Lyrics:

[Spoken Intro]
And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber, and took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself. And he brought me into a vast farmland of our own Midwest. And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose from the soil. One thousand, nay, a million voices full of fear. And terror possessed me then. And I begged, "Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?"
And the angel said unto me, "These are the cries of the carrots. The cries of the carrots. You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust". And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared, "Hear me now, I have seen the light! They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul! Damn you! Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!" Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you, Jesus

[Spoken Outro]
It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch. You looked up at your sky. Then, that made blue be your color. You had your knife there with you too. When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes. Your hands were sticky. You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green. Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this? You were already getting nervous again. Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up. Your head was almost empty. It always hurt you when you woke up like this. You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk, waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you. You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it. "If God is our father," you thought, "then Satan must be our cousin." Why didn't anyone else understand these important things? You got to your car and tried all the doors. They were locked. It was a red car and it was new. There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat. Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods. You began to walk towards them. Now red was your color, and of course, those little people out there were yours too75Embed

Title: Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)
Release Date: May 2, 2006, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-lost-keys-blame-hofmann-lyrics
Song Description: The meaning of the song itself is readily apparent.

The Blame Hofmann parenthetical in the title may refer to Albert Hofmann, the Swiss scientist known best for being the first person to synthesize, ingest, and learn of the psychedelic effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). He was also the first person to isolate, synthesize, and name the principal psychedelic mushroom compounds psilocybin and psilocin.

The Dr. Watson mentioned may be a reference to the sidekick of Sherlock Holmes. This would make sense, given that the doctor is trying to solve the mystery of who the gentleman is and whats going on.
Lyrics:

NURSE: Excuse me, doctor? If you have a moment.
DOCTOR: A moment? What's the question?
NURSE: More of a situation, a gentleman in Exam 3.
DOCTOR: What's the problem?
NURSE: That is the problem, we're not sure.
DOCTOR: You've got the chart?
NURSE: Right here.
DOCTOR: Hmm... not much here, is there?
NURSE: No doctor, no obvious physical trauma, vitals are stable
DOCTOR: Name?
NURSE: No sir.
DOCTOR: Did someone drop him off? Maybe we can speak to them. Let's get some background on this fellow.
NURSE: No ID, nothing, and he won't speak to anyone.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's say hello.

DOCTOR: Good morning, I'm Dr. Watson. How are you today? How are you today? Look, son, you're in a safe place, we want to help you, in whatever way we can. But you need to talk to us, we can't help you otherwise. Now, what's happened? Tell me everything.See Tool LiveGet tickets as low as $92You might also like2Embed

Release Date: May 15, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-faaip-de-oiad-lyrics
Song Description: The title is Enochian for Voice of God.

The talking is from a radio call-in show (Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell). It is one of the classic moments from that show, during which the caller claims to be a former Area 51 employee, and that the military was out to get him. Oddly enough, the satellite which carried that show suddenly died (losing the feed to some fifty stations) during the broadcast. The caller later admitted that the story was a hoax.

I, I don't have a whole lot of time
Um, okay, I'm a former employee of Area 51
I, I was let go on a medical discharge about a week ago and, and...
I've kind of been running across the country

They are extra-dimensional beings

They, they are not what they claim to be
Uh, they've infiltrated a, a lot of aspects of, of, of the military establishment
Particularly the Area 51
Uh, the disasters that are coming, they, the military
I'm sorry, the government knows about them
And there's a lot of safe areas in this world that they could begin moving the population to now

Title: Litanie contre la Peur
Release Date: August 30, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-litanie-contre-la-peur-lyrics
Song Description: Litanie Contre la Peur in French means Litany Against Fear. Litany, in Christian worship and some forms of Judaic worship, is a form of prayer used in services and processions, and consisting of a number of petitions. The word comes through Latin litania from Ancient Greek  (litanea), which in turn comes from  (lit), meaning supplication.

The name is in reference to Frank Herberts Dune. The Litany Against Fear is a mantra said, often by higher members of society and mental training in the series, as a way to ground themselves when they may be losing a grip due to fear and anxiety. Here it goes:

I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

By the way this quote perfectly describes whats going on in the title track

Title: Intension
Release Date: May 2, 2006, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-intension-lyrics
Song Description: Intension is the ninth song on 10,000 Days, the fourth studio album by heavy metal band Tool. It continues the more progressive style found on the majority of this album and their more recent work.

This song is about the development of human consciousness and the beginning of human evolution. It juxtaposes the purity of human consciousness with the destructive and corrupt desires of selfishness and base instincts.  It is connected to the next song in the album, Right In Two, which expands on these selfish desires.

As stated here previously,

Intension seems to be about the beginning of our creation and giving the definition, I think its about how in the beginning there were infinite possibilities of what we could become. Then Right in Two is what we actually have become. Its the Extension to the Intension if you will."
Lyrics:

Song Description: Any great warrior must confront the legion, however, one must protect themself from the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of potentially large crowds. Perhaps to inoculate yourself to the legion would be to make yourself immune to being at their affect.

Stoic philosophy tends to echo this sentiment, for example, Seneca in his moral letters to Lucilius:

To consort with the crowd is harmful; there is no person who does not make some vice attractive to us, or stamp it upon us, or taint us unconsciously therewith. Certainly, the greater the mob with which we mingle, the greater the danger.  I mean that I come home more greedy, more ambitious, more voluptuous, and even more cruel and inhuman, because I have been among human beings

Song Description: Flowing effortlessly from Prison Sex (Live), Jerk-Off (Live) is a live recording of Jerk-Off, which first appeared on Tools independent debut release, the 1991 demo tape 72826.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
"Used to be a bunch of assholes that lived in this part of the building here. But we systematically removed them like you would any kind of termite or roach."

[Verse 1]
Someone told me once that there's a right and wrong
Punishment was sure for those who dare to cross the line
But it must not be true
For jerk-offs just like you, and
Maybe it takes longer
To catch a total asshole
But I'm tired of waiting

[Verse 2]
Someone told me once that there's a right and wrong
Punishment was sure for those who dare to cross the line
But it must not be true
For jerk-offs just like you, and
Maybe it's just bullshit
I should play God
And shoot you myself
Tired of waiting, oh

[Verse 3]
Consequences dictate
Our course of action and it
Doesn't matter what's right
It's only wrong if you get caught
If consequences dictate
My course of action, I should
I should play God and just
Shoot you myself

Title: Useful Idiot
Release Date: September 17, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-useful-idiot-lyrics
Song Description: One of the albums many white noise segues between tracks. The sound heard is the needle of a record player running along the grooves of the vinyl. The band added this as a little joke upon those who purchased the vinyl version. It doesnt make as much sense on the CD version.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'm sweating
And breathing
And staring and thinking
And sinking
Deeper
And it's almost like I'm swimming
The sun is burning hot again
On the hunter
And the fisherman
And I'm trying to remember when
But it makes me dizzy

[Chorus]
Seems like I've been here before
Seems so familiar
Seems like I'm slipping
Into a dream within a dream
It's the way you whisper

Title: Mockingbeat
Release Date: August 30, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-mockingbeat-lyrics
Song Description: Mockingbeat (a post-apocalyptic outro to Fear Inoculum) provides us with what seems to be animal sounds in a jungle with many of them screeching and even dying suggesting that the human race is killing the nature because they only care about themselves. However because of all the egoism and power in the world (explained in 7empest) it appears the song suggests that humans will go extinct and nature will prevail once more. Humans are mocking the nature by not treating it well not knowing the consequences they are destined to face  extinction, which further shows the ignorance that humans often possess.

Lyrics:

[Monologue: Maynard James Keenan]
We've been, we've been trying something
A little different this tour
We've been looking at one of our songs
From a different angle, under a different light
So we can hopefully kind of
See it almost for the first time
We'd like to try that for you tonight, is that okay?
We're gonna need your help though
We need your help and your permission
So we need you to find a comfortable space
That's not only comfortable, but vulnerable
And to just shut your eyes and go there
And we'll meet you on the other side...

[Intro]
I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Take care not to make me enter
If I do we both may disappear
If I do we both may disappear
I saw the gap again today

And you as well, my dear

And pushing and shoving
And pushing me

Hands are on my back again

Terrified of what may come

Lyrics:

[Intro: Timothy Leary]
Think for yourself, question authority
Think for yourself, question authority
Throughout human history, as our species has faced the frightening, terrorizing fact that we do not know who we are, or where we're going in this ocean of chaos, it has been the authorities, the political, the religious, the educational authorities Who attempted to comfort us by giving us order, rules, regulations, informing, forming in our minds their view of reality
To think for yourself you must question authority and learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable, open-mindedness;
Chaotic, confused, vulnerability to inform yourself
Think for yourself, question authority
Think for yourself, question authority
Think for yourself, question authority
Think for yourself
Think for yourself
Order, regulations, rules
Think for yourself, question authority
Order, regulations, rules, comfort us

[Verse 1]
Dreaming of that face again
It's bright and blue and shimmering
Grinning wide
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes

[Verse 2]
On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again (And back again)
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye

[Verse 3]
A child's rhyme stuck in my head
It said that life is but a dream
I've spent so many years in question
To find I've known this all along

[Chorus 1]
So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running?
[Bridge]
Shrouding all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me
Black as holes within a memory
Blue as our new second sun
I stick my hand into the shadow
Pull the pieces from the sand
Try to attempt to reassemble
See just who I might have been
I do not recognize the vessel
But the eyes seem so familiar
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song

[Chorus 1]
So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why you running away?

I opened my eye, I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were

So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding from me
And you thought that I had run away
Chasing a trail of smoke and reason

[Speaking]
Stronzo, stronzo di merda
I'm trying to take a nap but
I couldn't sleep overnight because of you
Ugh, you really hurted me
Oh, you really hurt me
When I was high
You called me an asshole?
Quanto mi fai schifo
Pezzo di merda
Have you ever been trying to take a nap?
My heart beats too fast
Because I'm thinking of your fucking ugly face
You- you suck
Fai schifo
Pezzo di merda
Fai proprio schifo

Lyrics:

I've got the demons within
I've got to brush them all away

Shine his smile on me
I am the demon
Cleaner who saves the day
I get the back ones
And important they'll always stay
If only one thing that you know
Imposters from the show
They'll try to trick you into
Normal treatment
Oh don't you listen to them say
Shush them all away

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Someone told me once that there's a right and wrong
Punishment would come to those who dared to cross the line
But it must not be true
For jerk-offs just like you, and
Maybe it takes longer
To catch a total asshole
But I'm tired of waiting

Someone told me once that there's a right and wrong
Punishment was sure for those who dared to cross the line

Tired of waiting, oh

Consequences dictate
Our course of action and it
Doesn't matter what's right

Living on the street shores
He didn't learn and wanted children
Said, "What is there left to stay alive for?"
He doesn't want to see it
He didn't want to deal with it
Here they come, feelings that come as natural
Whatever left, he considered a loss, you all
He doesn't want to see it

[Bridge]
Running away, getting some kinda cure
"What is there left to keep him alive?" she said
Give him your love, give him your love to save him[x2]
Give him your love, give him your love to save him
Don't run away, give him your love to save him
Give him your love, give him your love to save him
Give him your love

[Chorus] [x2]
You can kill the revolutionary
But you can't kill the revolution

[Verse 2]
Lies, negative indoctrination of our good selves
Promote feelings of such hopelessness, powerlessness
Suicide or a slower death from addiction
Seemed to be the only way to stop the pain

My throat's wide open

Do unto others, what has been done to me
Do unto others, what has been done to you

I'm treading water
I need to sleep a while
My lamb and martyr
You look so precious won't you
Won't you come a bit, a bit closer
Close enough so I, I can smell you
I need you to feel this
I can't stand to burn too long
Release in sodomy
For one sweet moment I'm whole

Do unto you now, what has been done to me
Do unto you now, what has been done

You're breathing so I guess you're still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise
Won't you, won't you come on a bit closer
Close enough so I can smell you
I need you to feel this
I need this to make me whole
Release in sodomy
Have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted?
Have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted?
And only this one holy medium brings me piece of mind

I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this

You look so precious, you look so precious

Title: Flood (Live)
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-flood-live-lyrics
Song Description: Flood (Live) flows effortlessly from the end note of Opiate (Live), being the fifth track on Tools 1994 Dutch single-release: Sober  Tales from the Darkside, as well as the live version of the ninth track of the same name off of their 1993 debut studio album, Undertow. This version also features slightly altered lyrics from the studio release.
Lyrics:

All I knew and all I believed
[00:29.36]Are crumbling images
That no longer comfort me
I scramble to reach higher ground
Some order and sanity
Or something to comfort me
So I take what is mine, and hold what is mine
Suffocate what is mine, and bury what's mine
Soon the water will come
And claim what is mine
I must leave it behind
And climb to a new place now

This ground is not the rock I thought it to be

Thought I was high, and free
I thought I was there
Divine destiny
I was wrong
This changes everything

Running away
Running away now
Running away
Running away now
Running away
So I take what is mine, and hold what is mine
Suffocatе what is mine, and bury what's mine
Soon the watеr will come
And claim what is mine
I must leave it behind
And climb to a new place now

Thought the sun would come deliver me
But the truth has come to punish me instead

The ground is breaking down right under me
Cleanse and purge me

Title: Stinkfist Live
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-stinkfist-live-lyrics
Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

Something has to change
Undeniable dilemma
Boredom's not a burden
Anyone should bear
Constant over stimulation numbs me
But I would not want you any other way

Just not enough
I need more
Nothing seems to satisfy
I said
I don't want it
I just need it
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive

Finger deep within the borderline
Show me that you love me and that we belong together
Relax, turn around and take my hand

I can help you change
Tired moments into pleasure
Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way
Blend and balance
Pain and comfort
Deep within you
'Til you will not want mе any other way

It's not enough
I need more
Nothing seems to satisfy
I said
I don't want it
I just need it
To brеathe, to feel, to know I'm alive

Knuckle deep inside the borderline
This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to
Relax, slip away

Chupa minha pica bicha
Chupa minha pica bicha
Chupa minha pica bicha

There's something kinda sad about
The way that things have come to be
Desensitized to everything
What became of subtlety?
How can this mean anything to me
If I really don't feel anything at all?
I'll keep digging
'Til I feel something
Elbow deep inside the borderline
Show me that you love me and that we belong together
Shoulder deep within the borderline
Relax, turn around and take my handEmbed

Title: Recusant Ad Infinitum
Release Date: August 30, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-recusant-ad-infinitum-lyrics
Song Description: Recusant Ad Infinitum is a song that is technically part of Tools 2019 album, Fear Inoculum. It does not appear amongst the main 10 tracks, rather playing alongside a video that is shown on a rechargeable 4" screen on the inside of of the CD versions packaging. Thus it does not have an official position in the track list.
Although many unofficial rips do exist (made by putting a microphone up to the speaker housed in the unit), nobody has managed to rip the raw audio directly from the unit itself as of February, 2022.

The title is written in Latin, but when translated, can be broken down into two parts.
Recusant means: a person who refuses to submit to an authority or to comply with a regulation.
Ad infinitum means: to infinity or forevermore.

Title: To the icicle
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Tool-to-the-icicle-lyrics
Song Description: I did this just to entertain my friends, dont take this seriously. Obviously not a tool song, I just needed to put an artist in and I thought it would be funny.
Lyrics:

Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Cole Niswander, it's time
It's time, Cole Niswander (aight, Cole Niswander, begin)
Straight out the gay dungeons of rap

The addict drops deep as does my moose
I never game, 'cause to game is the daddy of use
Beyond the walls of tool fans, life is defined
I think of my testicles when I'm in a Cum-ville state of mind
Hope the juice got some use
My abuse don't like no dirty loose
Run up to the producе and get the goose

In a Cum-villе state of mind
What more could you ask for? The mexican addict?
You complain about your testicles
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the derelict

I'm rappin' to the bicycle
And I'm gonna move your icicle

Filipino, greek, racist, like a monkey
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a flunky
I can't take the your testicles, can't take the snake
I woulda tried to meme I guess I got no cake

Ain't a soul alive that could take my daddy's conflict
