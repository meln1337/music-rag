Artist: The Weeknd, Alternate Names: King of the Fall, Abel "The Weeknd" Tesfaye, Abel M. Tesfaye, A. Tesfaye, Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, Kin Kane, Abel Tesfaye
Artist Description: Abel Makkonen Tesfaye (born February 16, 1990 in Scarborough, Ontario), popularly known as The Weeknd, is an R&B/pop/hip-hop singer-songwriter and record producer from Toronto, Canada. He has been referred to as the songbird of his generation and the best musical talent since Michael Jackson throughout his career.

The Weeknd gained widespread critical acclaim for his three mixtapes, House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence, which he later compiled to make a remastered, three-disc album titled Trilogy after signing his record deal with Republic. In 2013, he released Kiss Land, which was considered to be his debut studio album.

In 2014, he dropped “Often,” a remix of Beyonce’s “Drunk In Love,” and “King of the Fall.” The Weeknd released two songs in collaboration with the film Fifty Shades of Grey, with “Earned It” becoming his solo breakout hit.

His second studio album became highly-anticipated, with riveting singles like “The Hills” and “Can’t Feel My Face” leaving fans hungry for more. Beauty Behind the Madness was released on August 28, 2015.

His third studio album, Starboy, was released on November 25, 2016. The Daft Punk-assisted title track led the project as its first official single, released on Wednesday, September 21, 2016, before becoming his third number one track in the United States, as also his home country, Canada.
The effort was a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 albums chart with over 348,000 copies sold in its first week, all eighteen tracks debuting on the Billboard Hot 100, receiving a GRAMMY Award for the Best Urban Contemporary Album category at the 60th annual ceremony, overall for the second time in his music career and being ranked as the third most popular album of 2017 in the U.S.

His follow-up EP, My Dear Melancholy,, released on March 30, 2018 includes themes revolving around his breakups with Bella Hadid during summer of 2016 and Selena Gomez in October 2017, respectively. With the lead single, “Call Out My Name”, the Canadian singer earned the largest first-day Spotify stream count of any song released in 2018 at that time and his eighth Top 10 entry on Hot 100.

Tesfaye’s fourth studio album (and his first in three years), After Hours was officially released on March 20, 2020, and is named after a 1985 movie directed by his idol, Martin Scorsese. It was primarily supported by November 2019-released singles “Heartless” and “Blinding Lights,” with the pair becoming his fourth and fifth #1 singles in the US and the latter his first #1 single in the UK. The successful promotional title track and “In Your Eyes” were also released as singles. A remix of “Save Your Tears” with Ariana Grande gave After Hours three US #1 singles in three years.

On February 5, 2021, Tesfaye released the greatest hits album The Highlights. This is his second compilation album since Trilogy. The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 and became his highest charting compilation album. The Highlights was released two days before his performance on the Super Bowl LV half time show.

Tesfaye followed up After Hours with Dawn FM, released on January 7, 2022. Preceded by the single “Take My Breath”, the album imagines itself as the radio station on the highway between death and the after-life. Dawn FM peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200 and #1 in 11 countries. His worldwide After Hours ‘Til Dawn tour commenced on July 14 that year.

On February 24, 2023, Tesfaye released a remix of his 2016 track “Die for You” with Ariana Grande after the song gained popularity on TikTok. The remix became the seventh #1 single for both artists on the Billboard Hot 100.

Tesfaye co-created and starred in The Idol, a 2023 TV series about a female pop star who meets a cult-like figure. Although the show received negative reviews, songs from its soundtrack, like “Double Fantasy” and “Popular”, found some commercial success.

Title: The Hills
Release Date: May 27, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-the-hills-lyrics
Song Description: Originally nicknamed Mood Music and first teased in a live performance at SXSW, the narrative of The Hills is a sinking sexual affair. Abel sets the record straight about what this woman means to him, and reminds her that she plays an equally guilty part in this affair.

On the Hot 100 dated October 3, 2015, The Hills reached number one on the chart, dethroning his own Cant Feel My Face. With the feat, Abel became only the 11th artist to replace himself at #1, and the 2nd artist to top the chart with a lead single after the second single was released. (Rihanna did it in 2010 with lead single Only Girl (In The World) and second single Whats My Name, which featured frequent Weeknd collaborator Drake.) It topped the chart for six weeks, becoming his longest-running #1.

On October 11th, two remixes were released featuring both Eminem and Nicki Minaj respectively.

Song Description: On Die For You The Weeknd croons about the conflicting feelings and pain that comes with letting go of someone he still has intense feelings for.

Many fans speculate the song was written about Abels then ex-girlfriend, supermodel Bella Hadid following rumors, that the two ended their relationship close to Starboys official release due to their conflicting work schedules. Additionally, Abel admitted to Zane Lowe in an interview that the song was finished a mere week before the albums release, raising more suspicions that hed written the song about a recent split.



On 11/25/2021, the fifth anniversary of Starboy, a music video was at last released for the track.

In February 2023, The Weeknd released a remix of the track featuring Ariana Grande, their first collaboration since their hit remix of Abels track Save Your Tears.

But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
[Chorus]
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you

Title: Can’t Feel My Face
Release Date: June 8, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-cant-feel-my-face-lyrics
Song Description: This song personifies drug addiction, likening it to the love of a woman and has been described as classic pop by critics, comparing its sound to that of Michael Jackson.

This track also marked the first collaboration between The Weeknd and powerhouse pop producer Max Martin.

Cant Feel My Face is the third single from The Weeknds second studio album; it leaked along with In The Night and Acquainted, (which was leaked as an incomplete track referred to as Girls Born in the 90s) on May 25, 2015. The song later premiered live at Apples WWDC, in conjunction with the announcement of the Apple Music service.

Cant Feel My Face was The Weeknds first solo pop hit, without the aid of Ariana Grande or the Fifty Shades of Grey film. As such, it marked the completion of The Weeknds four-year transition from niche alternative R+B to bonafide pop stardom. The song eventually reached #1 on the Billboard chart for three nonconsecutive weeks.

Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though

And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor

Title: Call Out My Name
Release Date: March 30, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-call-out-my-name-lyrics
Song Description: Sampling his Oscar-nominated Earned It over a slow piano-driven beat from producer Frank Dukes (who collaborated with The Weeknd on his previous effort Starboy), Abel details his struggles to let go of a past relationship.

Abel explains that, although he is aware that his last lover didnt put as much effort into the relationship as he did (wasted my time), he still wishes deep down that she would need him as much as he still needs her.

Call Out My Name starts out with a sample from composer Nicols Jaar, from the opening track Killing Time out of his Sirens (2016) album. It plays around the entire track, providing it with its melancholic-atmospheric vibe.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

[Chorus]
So call out my name (Call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (Want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—

[Verse 2]
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe

So call out my name when I kiss you so gently (Ohh)
I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait 'til I?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name (Say call out my name, baby)
Girl call out my name and I'll be on my way
And, I'll be on my—

Title: Blinding Lights
Release Date: November 29, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-blinding-lights-lyrics
Song Description: Blinding Lights is the second single to The Weeknds fourth studio album After Hours, following the records lead single Heartless, which released two days prior on November 27, 2019. The track finds Abel in a constant state of distraction that he only gets relief from when in the presence of a significant other, as he sings over an up-tempo electropop instrumental that features large 80s-inspired synths and synthwave drums, similar to the sonic direction of his third studio album, Starboy.

The track was first announced on November 24, 2019 in the trailer for a Mercedes Benz advertisement. The full commercial debuted minutes after the songs release and is heavily centered around it. In the ad, The Weeknd drives around in a Mercedes car as the track plays in the background.

The song leaked on November 26, 2019, a few days before its official release. Abel acknowledged this in a tweet, where he confirmed its official release:

oh yah and more new music tonight (in HQ)

A music video for the track was released on January 21, 2020. The video is a continuation of the music video from Heartless, starting with Abel stopping his manic run through Las Vegas, which is where the video for Heartless ended. From there, Abel continues his tear through the city while under the influence of many substances, this time going to a strip club as well as driving a different luxury Mercedes Benz AMG-GT in the video.

Title: Heartless
Release Date: November 27, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-heartless-lyrics
Song Description: Heartless is the lead single to The Weeknds fourth studio album and his first solo single since 2018s Call Out My Name.

The tracks release was first teased on November 25th, 2019, with Tesfaye posting to his Instagram for the first time since its reactivation, with the caption:

the fall starts tomorrow night

The song was premiered on the seventh episode of The Weeknds Beats 1 Radio show, Memento Mori.

The tracks accompanying music video released on December 3, 2019, features an intoxicated Abel gambling and smoking with producer Metro Boomin in Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, with blindingly bright lights, Vegas' most memorable feature, surrounding the two artists. The tracks cover art likely comes from the same area given that the background of the cover is similar to the bright cityscape seen in the music video.
Lyrics:

And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now (Star)

Title: I Feel It Coming
Release Date: June 24, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-i-feel-it-coming-lyrics
Song Description: Inspired by house-and 80s pop, I Feel It Coming is about wanting more from a relationship. The song differs from The Weeknds usual attitudes towards love, which revolve around one-night stands and lighthearted fun.

With a catchy but laid-back chorus, a danceable sound, and Abels impressive vocal performance, I Feel It Coming is yet another Weeknd track that draws a comparison to Michael Jackson.

The song was one of two singles released by The Weeknd on November 17, 2016, alongside Party Monster.
Lyrics:

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Yeah, ah

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Tell me what you really like
Baby, I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes
'Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it could set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
You are not the single type
So, baby, this the perfect time
I'm just tryna get you high (I'm just tryin', babe)
And faded off this touch
You don't need a lonely night
So, baby, I can make it right
You just gotta let me try (Try)
To give you what you want

Title: After Hours
Release Date: February 19, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-after-hours-lyrics
Song Description: After Hours is the title track and the third promotional single for The Weeknds fourth studio album After Hours. The song addresses a failed relationship that ended in heartbreak and serves as an apology letter for his past transgressions, as he desires reconciliation.

Additionally, the songs dark vibes and altered vocals over hard-hitting production are reminiscent of styles seen on Abels earlier music such as November 2012s Trilogy. The track is also thematically similar to songs from that era, as he once again details the pain and anguish associated with heartbreak.

On February 18, 2020, the day before the tracks release, Abel revealed the albums cover art and teased the tracks release date via social media.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Thought I almost died in my dream again (Baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep (Oh, oh)
Without you, I can't sleep (Fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe

[Verse 2]
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah
[Bridge]
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home

[Chorus]
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go

Title: Save Your Tears
Release Date: March 20, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-save-your-tears-lyrics
Song Description: On Save Your Tears, The Weeknd once again addresses his past relationships and recollects on the experiences they went through together, while also providing no emotional support for his ex. The song is one of the more 80s, synth-heavy tracks featured on the record compared to the darker, muddier tracks seen during the middle of the record.

On July 12, 2019, a snippet of the track appeared online, leading many to believe that it was set to appear on After Hours. On March 17, 2020, the music identifying app Shazam revealed that the track was the eleventh track on The Weeknds fourth studio album, After Hours. It was later confirmed by The Weeknd on the same day when the albums track list was released.

On August 9, 2020, the track was released as the albums fourth single in Europe, followed by releasing in the United States on November 24, 2020. A music video accompanying the track was released on January 5, 2021.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Ooh
Na-na, yeah

[Verse 1]
I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

[Verse 2]
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay

And now you won't love me for a second time

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said, I make you cry when I run away

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better

Song Description: With an upbeat-yet-dark attitude, Abel details a re-introduction to his lavish party lifestyle and his pursuit of a woman who is already spoken for. Musically, Doc McKinney and Ben Billions' beat effectively delivers a woozy, paranoid vibe, which mirrors the substance-induced haze of the overindulgent events disclosed in the lyrics.

Party Monster features additional vocals from the tracks co-writer and Prisoner collaborator Lana Del Rey, who is featured on the albums eighth track Stargirl Interlude.

Party Monster was one of two singles released a week prior to Starboy, dropping alongside I Feel It Coming on November 17.

Title: Earned It
Release Date: December 17, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-earned-it-lyrics
Song Description: One of the best modern R&B voices is featured on the soundtrack for Fifty Shades of Grey. Would it be a complete soundtrack without Abel?

Revealed on August 4th, 2015, Earned It is also  featured on Beauty Behind the Madness, The Weeknds second studio album.

Set to one of his most upbeat and orchestral instrumentals yet, he dances between classy and lecherous as he woos the one girl he truly loves. This mirrors Christians infatuation as he enjoys Anas (fleeting) innocence in the film.

Earned It became his solo breakout hit, earning him one of spring 2015s biggest radio singles and  the song won the Best R&B Performance at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards.

Title: Sidewalks
Release Date: November 25, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-sidewalks-lyrics
Song Description: On Sidewalks, Abel and Kendrick use sidewalks as a metaphor for their path from humble beginnings to fame and fortune.

Both The Weeknd and Kendrick grew up in less-than-ideal settings. Abel was born in Scarborough, Ontario, Canada, an area with one of the highest crime rates in Greater Toronto, while Kendrick grew up in Compton, California, one of the deadliest cities in the world.
Lyrics:

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I ran out of tears when I was eighteen
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me, then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga, then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never makin' money, ah
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pullin' up in Aventadors
Just know we been grindin' on them sidewalks

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They show me all the signs

I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off Dyke and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightnin', tightenin', strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Aw, Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)
Head, head, more head (Head)
Oh God, bless the dead (Yup)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

Release Date: March 30, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-wasted-times-lyrics
Song Description: Wasted Times sees The Weeknd putting his two high-profile relationships with Bella Hadid and Selena Gomez in perspective.

It can be inferred from lines referencing her past as an equestrian that the girl that The Weeknd is reminiscing about is Bella. Moreover, he and Bella recently reconnected.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Wasted times I spent with someone else
She wasn't even half of you
Reminiscin' how you felt
Reminiscin' how you felt
And even though you put my life through hell
I can't seem to forget 'bout you, 'bout you
I want you to myself

[Chorus]
And now I'm askin', who do you belong to now?
Who you give that love to now?
Who you pullin' up on?
Who you gettin' sprung for now?
And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot
Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot
'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings

[Verse 2]
Catchin' feelings
These girls only want you when you're winnin' (Winnin')
But you've been with me from the beginnin' (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
And I know right now that we're not talkin' (Not talkin')
I hope you know this dick is still an option
'Cause I'll beat it up (I'll beat it up, yeah)
I took my time to learn the way your body functions
You were equestrian, so ride it like a champion (Ride it, baby)

Title: Tell Your Friends
Release Date: August 24, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-tell-your-friends-lyrics
Song Description: Tell Your Friends debuted live on stage in Las Vegas, and was followed by the release of a music video just days before Beauty Behind the Madness was due to release. The video also featured visuals for the albums intro, Real Life.

The song has our Canadian crooner inviting listeners to take a real look at his lifestyle  Abel has nothing to hide. Self destruction, chasing fame, relationships with women and drugs are all major themes throughout the album. The track was produced by Kanye West, who approached Abel first.

Everyones a character on my album, and [Kanyes] production, voice, and input is a character, too. Theres so much detail in his sessions, and he definitely helped craft who Ive been, subconsciously, for the past few years. To actually be with him and talk to him and work with him, its just like coming to lifeKanye needed to be on this album, because I feel like Im going through what hes been going throughreinventing himself and pushing the boundaries. And he looks at himself as pop. He says, Im a pop artist. You cant put me in one category."

In addition to producing this track, Kanye also styled Abel for his GQ shoot where he sported the first Yeezy Collection with Adidas.

Also after much speculation of there being no OVOXO revival,  Drake, the 6 God himself, decided to drop a freestyle remix over top of this song.

This beat was originally slated for inclusion on Kanye Wests unreleased 2014 album So Help Me God. West later released an unfinished track with this beat called When I See It to SoundCloud.
Lyrics:

[Produced by Che Pope, Kanye West and The Weeknd; Co-produced by Illangelo; Additional production by Mike Dean]

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh, no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor wit' a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it

[Chorus: The Weeknd]

Title: Montreal
Release Date: December 21, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-montreal-lyrics
Song Description: With Illangelos thunderous bass, rattling snares, and The Weeknds wondrous falsetto, Montreal is the first original song from Echoes of Silence. The noticeable change in tone can be attributed to the change in recording location. In his first interview ever with Complex, Abel recalls recording Echoes of Silence:

Echoes of Silence was made in Montreal. I had a lot of darkness in that city.

Contrary to Abels previous music, Montreal tells the story of a girl who was too late in realizing that he was completely in love with her.

A sample from Laisse Tomber Les Filles, originally performed by France Gall, is interpolated by The Weeknd for the intro and outro of this song. This wouldnt be the last time he uses different languages in his music.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera
Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour-là
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour-là
Je ne pleurerai pas
Je ne pleurerai pas

[Verse 1]
I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased
Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
'Cause I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be

[Chorus]
And it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I say that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)

Happiness exists when you don't know a thing
So I hope you don't think this song is about you
And only I can know how close you came
But baby I'm a pro at letting go
I love it when they come and go

[Chorus]
But it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I say that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all

Title: The Morning
Release Date: January 3, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-the-morning-lyrics
Song Description: The morning has come for Abel and his love interest, and the high from the previous night sends Abels girl departing and Abel himself into a candid, reflective state about his musical progression as well as the females that emerge in his nightlife: prostitutes and strippers.

A favorite of many XO fans (including Taylor Swift), this song has appeared on both Capital Xtras and Red Bulls lists of best Weeknd songs.

This is the second of three tracks that would be produced (and ultimately secured) from producer Jeremy Rose. Abel would later feud for rights to the songs. The version that appears on House of Balloons and Trilogy is not the Rose-produced version. Roses demo, one of the three 2010 drops that first brought fans to the Weeknd, featured pitched-down rapping and a faster tempolikely recorded during The Weeknds Kin Kane days.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
"Listen, listen"

[Verse 1]
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

[Verse 2]
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (Zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw, ain't no nigga with her rollin'
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (The money is the motive)
All that money

Title: House of Balloons / Glass Table Girls
Release Date: March 21, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-house-of-balloons-glass-table-girls-lyrics
Song Description: In the first of many two part songs, Abel describes a drug induced party scene, most likely going on in his former house on 65 Spencer, which was one of the many influences for House of Balloons. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Abel shared the party experience that he and his crew had, (which additionally explains the title of the album and song) saying:

Wed throw these shitty parties and have girls over, and wed try to make it celebratory, so wed have balloons

The second part of the song, Glass Table Girls, hones in on the particular drug activity they had at those parties.

The track samples the 1980 song Happy House by Siouxsie and the Banshees.
Lyrics:

[Part I: House of Balloons]

But you belong to me, ooh, you belong to me

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah, I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

Title: In the Night
Release Date: August 28, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-in-the-night-lyrics
Song Description: Though upbeat in tempo, In the Night explores dark themes following a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, similar to the horror stories told on The Weeknds debut studio album, Kiss Land.  The New York Times describes In the Night as the albums most electric moment.

The song is reminiscent of Marilyn Monroes survival story  American actress and model was sexually abused as a child and often spoke out about it in the media. Interestingly, Marilyn Monroe was able to use her sexuality as a source of healing, becoming known as Americas Most Famous Sex Symbol.

In an interview with GQ, The Weeknd speaks about this inspiration:

Maxs studio used to be Marilyn Monroes old house and I came up with the concept for a song called In the Night in her bedroom. That was pretty amazing. Unfortunately I couldnt help but imagine Joe DiMaggios sperm everywhere on the floor.

The Weeknd also revealed further inspiration to the The New York Times, stating the song was made in homage to Michael Jackson. When first played for music publisher, Ron Perry, screamed with excitement:

Its Billie Jean! Its Billie [expletive] Jean!
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
All alone, she was livin'
In a world without an end or beginnin'
Baby girl was livin' life for the feelin'
But I don't mind, I don't mind, oh
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind, I don't mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know (Know)
That she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when (When)
You wake up, she's always gone, gone, gone, oh

[Chorus]
In the night, she hears him calling
In the night, she's dancin' to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand
In the night, when she comes crawlin'
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand

Lyrics:

[Part I]
[Verse 1]
When I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall
But when she put it in her mouth
She can't seem to reach my
Ballin' ain't an issue for me
I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week
Do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit, baby, I'm a little camera-shy
But exceptions can be made, baby, ‘cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here only takin' pictures
You gon' have to take your ass home

[Bridge]
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk

[Hook]
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out

You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free
You gotta pay with your body
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right
I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you to my West Coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, I'm tryna finish all this potion
Baby, take your time, tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
And if you're still up, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'
Said I'm two days strong
And never sleep until it's mornin', until the mornin'

[Part II]
[Verse 3]
I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida, 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep…
[Outro]

This ain't nothing to relate to

This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to

Release Date: August 18, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-the-zone-lyrics
Song Description: Before Abel can get involved with this girl, who isnt his Lonely Star, he has to get in [his] zone by leaning and smoking up.

This is the first collaboration between The Weeknd and Drake on one of Abels projects. Around the same time, Abel worked with Drake on Take Care, which included giving him several tracks from House of Balloons.

Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole

Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own

I'm Addy'd up, add it up, I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous (Oh!)
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dyin' (Feeling like I'm dyin')
Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher (Get me higher)
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private (Oh!)
My flight too private, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet

[Chorus]
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (Know I might like it)
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (Know I might like it)

Man, your girl so bad, let me get her (Get her, get her)
Your girl so bad, let me get her (Get her, get her)
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call till the fall, he can like it or not, nigga, back the fuck up
If you ain’t with me, motherfucker, you against me ('Gainst me)
If you ain’t complimentin' nigga, you offendin' ('Fending)
I've been out here last year wasting hella time (Hella time)
XO is the only time invested
Them Fall shows every year like a birthday (Birthday)
And I'ma do it every year in my birthplace (Birthplace)
And I ain’t been this gone since Thursday (Thursday)

Just sold out the O2 at my own pace

I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now that word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be soundin' like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow

All of them swallow, all of them swallow

She'll probably O.D. before I show her to momma
All these girls try to tell me she got no love
But all these girls never ever got her blowjob
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops, then I might get violent
No call is worth stopping
So, momma, please stop calling
And we can play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fucking prove
This feeling I would give to

No, no

[Post-Chorus]
I've been sober for a year, now it's time for me
To go back to my old ways, don't you cry for me
Thought I'd be a better man, but I lied to me and to you

I take half a Xan' and I still stay awake
All my demons wanna pull me to my grave
I choose Vegas if they offer Heaven's gate
I tried to love, but you know I'd never stay

But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me
I want you to follow right behind me
I want you to hold me while I'm smilin'
While I'm dyin'
And if you know me
When I go missing, you know where to find me
Driving down the boulevard is blindin'
Always blinded by the desert lights and
I'm alive when

I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
No, no
Girl, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
No, no

Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love

Release Date: March 30, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-try-me-lyrics

But I'm ready to go all the way if you let me
Don't you tempt me
You're lookin' grown since the last time I looked at you

Title: Rolling Stone
Release Date: May 25, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-rolling-stone-lyrics
Song Description: A rolling stone refers to smoking weed while rolling on ecstasy. The title alludes to Bob Dylans Like A Rolling Stone, where the phrase means a man who never settles down, but rather restlessly moves through the world.

While this song essentially serenades the Lonely Star, it also covers a larger metaphor. Instead of settling on the sound and success Abels found early in his career, he acknowledges that he wants to grow as an artist, and hopes his fans will follow him through his journey. He details this in an open letter to fans he released in 2012.

The Trilogy cover was derived from the music video for this song.

The guitar melody for this track was influenced by Andre Nickatinas Ayo For Yayo.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now you're thinkin' 'bout it
Girl you're thinkin' 'bout it
What we got here
How we fuckin' got here
They recognized
They just recognize
I'm in a life without a home so this recognition's not enough
I don't care about nobody else
'Cause I've been on these streets for too long, too long, too long
Baby, I've been on this too long

[Verse 2]
'Cause getting faded too long
Got me on this rolling stone
So I take another hit
Kill another serotonin
With a hand full of beans
And a chest full of weed
Got me singing 'bout a bitch
While I'm blowing out my steam
Yeah, I know I got my issues
Why you think I fuckin' flow?
And I'ma keep on smoking 'til I can't hit another note

Before they all love me
Until you won't love me, oh
Because they'll all love me, ooh

Title: Shameless
Release Date: August 28, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-shameless-lyrics
Song Description: Shameless presents a friends-with-benefits arrangement gone bad. Abel continues in the sexual relationship, even though he realizes the emotional damage it is doing to his partner.  Instead of being apologetic, he blames the girl for not being honest with herself. Abel is choosing to fulfill his own needs without shame.

The beat was produced by both The Weeknd and Wheezy. Acoustic guitar creates a dark laid-back groove that magnifies the callous disregard of the lyrics.

Title: Privilege
Release Date: March 30, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-privilege-lyrics
Song Description: Privilege is the outro track of My Dear Melancholy, where Abel seemingly addresses his public past relationship with Selena Gomez.

The chorus references the ultimatum that Morpheus gives Neo in The Matrix, where the red pill is facing reality and the blue pill is living in blissful ignorance. Abel flips this into a line about re-embracing his well-documented past with pills in addition to drinking alcohol to cope with the end of his relationship.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Enjoy your privileged life
'Cause I'm not gonna hold you through the night
We said our last goodbyes
So, let's just try to end it with a smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna hear that you are suffering
You are suffering no more
'Cause I held you down when you were suffering
You were suffering

[Chorus]
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away

[Bridge]
And I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okay
They said our love is just a game, I don't care what they say
But I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old ways
And I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh

Title: Twenty Eight
Release Date: November 13, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-twenty-eight-lyrics
Song Description: The title Twenty Eight (28) is approximately the amount of grams that makes up an ounce. This is infamously known in the illegal drug trade. The title creates more emphasis as to how The Weeknds music has a certain drug inducing effect on his fans.

Twenty Eight also refers to the fact its his twenty eighth official, professional song. (27 from his first three mixtapes, then Twenty Eight being the first of his bonus tracks).

In addition, the song serves as an extended metaphor for Abel breaking into the mainstream realm and his feelings about that. In Abels letter to his fans and in the track Rolling Stone, he expresses more concerns over this happening.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
This house is not a home to you
But you decide to go ahead and lay down, lay down
There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference
’Cause I see you’re here to stay
Should’ve known to pick my fate (Oh no)

[Chorus]
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)

[Verse 2]
Hey there, lonely girl
Did you have to tell your friends
About  the way I got you screaming my name?
Did you have to tell the world?
Now your girls all wanna fuck
Girl you could’ve been the one
Gotta change my number twice a month
When you could have simply kept it on the down low

But who keeps calling on your phone?

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I used to pray when I was sixteen
If I didn't make it, then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
Not to mislead, turn my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin'
Couldn't even breathe and
For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving

[Chorus]
Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

[Verse 2]
She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex, give her Philip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis à la mode, nigga

I've been mixin', I've been sippin'
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water
I want you, now now
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
Don't take my number, don't want your number
I'll call you back if that head right baby
I won't love you, I can't love you
Unless that pussy got some super powers
I want you, now now
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now

[Chorus]
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love

Wanna fuck a skinny model right before her runway show
She the one in the back, nose running from the blow
And we did it on the floor, that's why she walkin' kind of funny
Should've never put us on, bitch I'm only 24
And everybody salty, niggas stop your bitchin'
Everybody makin' money, we don't need to kick it
I'm chillin' with my niggas, everybody got a crib
Did an album just to do it, droppin' albums like a pill
Percocets, Adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed
Faded for a week, I don't sleep, fuck my enemies
Try to stay sane is like a full-time hobby
Everything I do, fake niggas always copy
All I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
And if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand
Dick made out of magic, my tongue got superpowers
I woke up in the mornin', models passed out in the shower

[Chorus]
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night930Embed

Title: Initiation
Release Date: October 8, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-initiation-lyrics
Song Description: In a girls quest for his love and acceptance, The Weeknd describes the dark, drug-induced lifestyle that she has to comply with. Getting down with him means getting down with the whole XO crew.

There are two main themes potentially covered in this track, all dependent on the interpretation of my boys:


Boys may refer to the XO crew, meaning Abels girl needs to gain their approval or treat them right, including possibly having a train ran on her. This is reinforced by the official audios theme on Abels Youtube channel having a picture of him with two anonymous persons.
The other possibility is my boys refers to Abels massive drug collection; she needs to engage in his drugs before she can be accepted.



Throughout the song, The Weeknds voice is chopped-and-screwed so as to make it sound like hes leaning, or sped up to make it sound like hes on coke.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Oh, yeah, got you drinking out them white cups, sodas
All this shit so foreign to you, thick smoke, choking
Baby, get familiar with the order
Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low
My eyes red but my brim low, that XO
She climbing, straight to the top, forgetting why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate slow, put that rum down, you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when you’re finished, we’ll head to where I’m living
The party won’t finish, it’s a fucking celebration, oh yeah
For my niggas out tonight
And they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work, you don't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work, you don't gotta check the sky
We'll be going all night, 'til light

[Chorus]
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys

[Verse 2]
And you've been going hard, baby
Now you rolling with some big boys, baby
Got a lot you wanna show off, baby
Close that door before you take your fucking clothes off, baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and I'm experiencing fall
And all I wanna do is leave 'cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, tryna concentrate to breathe
'Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, heavy gum chewing
Go on if you thirsty, baby, if you thirsty
Grab a cup of that XO, baby, I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl, I've been fiending
For another round, don't you blame it on me
When you're grinding up your teeth and it's fucking hard to sleep

And if you get too high

[Verse 3]
Baby, come over here and
Ride it out, ride it out
Work that back 'til I tire out
Roll that weed, bring that fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Bed so wet when I eat you out
Girl's friends scream that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep 'em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking reefer now
Bet a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out
Baby, baby
[Chorus]
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and ride it out

Release Date: March 21, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-loft-music-lyrics
Song Description: Abel takes a woman to his loft in the city to have some fun in this uptempo track.

The track samples Gila from Beach Houses 2008 album Devotion. This is the second time Abels sampled a Beach House track, the first time being on The Party & the After Party.

This is the third and final track that would be produced (and ultimately secured) from producer Jeremy Rose. Abel would later feud for rights to the songs.

Unless you like to tease, baby
When in reality you don't know how to please, baby

Wet dream fry your brain all day, all day

Baby, it's okay

Seem to have 20 different pills in 'em
They tell us that they love us
Even though they want a next man
And the next man's bitch want the third man

Title: Prisoner
Release Date: August 28, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-prisoner-lyrics
Song Description: Prisoner debuted during The Weeknds show in U.K. and was dubbed Mood Music 2 (like The Hills, which was dubbed Mood Music when it debuted during SXSW 2015).

That first performance did not feature Lana Del Reys falsetto vocals. When the track listing for BBTM came out and people realized Lana would be putting her twist on it, Prisoner quickly became one of the records most anticipated tracks. Lana is the only woman featured on an otherwise completely male album (Maty Noyes does appear uncredited on the final track, Angel).

On this morbid-pop-meets-lusty-R&B track, the addict (Abel) and the tortured lover (Lana), respectively croon about their painsAbel comes to grips with falling in love with fame, while Lana contemplates her relationship with Hollywood.

Me and Lana have been friends for a long time. Ive inspired her, shes inspired me. I feel like weve always been talking to each other through our music. She is the girl in my music, and I am the guy in her musicShe was definitely the first feature that I wanted to bring on this album.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
You bring good to my lonely life, honestly (Honestly)
It's hard for me to look into your eyes
When I say (I say) that I would be nothing without your love (Your love)
I feel the rush and it's amazing

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place (Up in this place), yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all (Want it all)
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way (Out of its way)
'Cause I know, all I know (Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah), all I know

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey]
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh (Ahh)

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey & The Weeknd]
I think I've been in Hollywood for too long (For too long)
'Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch ('Out the touch)
I feel the rush and it's amazing, hmm

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey & The Weeknd]
Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place (Ahh)
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all (Want it all)
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way (Out of its way)

Title: True Colors
Release Date: November 25, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-true-colors-lyrics
Song Description: Following Secrets, which explored a deceptive love interest, True Colors is about learning who this female really is, not who she wants Abel to think she is. The monogamous themes explored throughout the project also continue to be expressed through this track. Abel uses the imagery of colors, or the lack thereof, as an extended metaphor throughout this track.

Title: High for This
Release Date: March 21, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-high-for-this-lyrics
Song Description: The eerie opening track on The Weeknds debut project takes us into an interaction between Abel and a girl being introduced to the XO nightlife. This song also serves as a notice for listeners to prepare to dive into the life of an innovative, edgy artist.

The atmosphere depicted in this track is both dark and mysterious, leading to The Weeknd assuming a dominant position. However, this should not portray a non-consensual situation, as The Weeknd has explained:

The tone is dark, the environment is the dark. But theres not force in it. They want to have a good time. Everybody wants to be there. Whether they regret their choices after is whatever. But everybody is in consent.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You don't know what's in store
But you know what you're here for
Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me (Ooh)
Hold tight for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone, we don't need attention

[Chorus]
Open your hand, take a glass
Don't be scared, I'm right here
Even though, you don't roll
Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this

[Verse 2]
Take it off, you want it off
'Cause I know what you're feeling
It's okay, girl, I feel it too
Let it be, baby breathe
I swear I'm right here
We'll be good, I promise, we'll be so good, yeah

Title: Stargirl Interlude
Release Date: November 25, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-stargirl-interlude-lyrics
Song Description: Infectious and erotic, slow and washed in drenching synths, Stargirl Interlude is the eighth track from The Weeknds third studio album Starboy. The interlude features previous collaborator Lana Del Rey who co-wrote the song.

The title of the track is a reference to the success of Abel as a Starboy, who happens to need a superwoman to complete him. However, the lyrics are mysterious in nature and Del Rey starts off low and ends high, The Weeknd closing off the 2-minute interlude.

During an interview on Beats 1 Radio, The Weeknd talked about his relationship with Lana and the songs they have written together:

I was making my music and it felt like Lana Del Reys lyrics and my lyrics were talking to each other sometimes. Shes one of my closest friends in the industry.

The day Starboy dropped, Del Rey took to Instagram to post a video of herself singing and dancing along to the song.
Lyrics:

[Verse: Lana Del Rey]
I had a vision
A vision of my nails in the kitchen
Scratchin' counter tops, I was screamin'
My back arched like a cat
My position couldn't stop, you were hittin'
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it (I love it), starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy

Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you shoulda seen the other guy

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well, baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles, that's why

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
In my dark time, I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark time, baby, this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time
In my dark time

Title: What You Need
Release Date: January 2, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-what-you-need-lyrics
Song Description: This slow, seductive ballad draws on a metaphor equating The Weeknd to the collective group of drugs he ingests and provides to his lovers. The female being serenaded here is victim to both a physical dependency on drugs and an emotional dependency for connection with Abel.

The original version of What You Need released on House of Balloons sampled Aaliyahs Rock the Boat. However, it was the only sample not cleared upon Trilogys release and was removed from the track.

The first of three tracks produced from Jeremy Rose, Abel would later feud against him for rights to the songs.

In select live performances involving this track, The Weeknd performed a version merging this song with Kiss Land opener Professional.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Aaliyah]
Baby, now hold me close
Baby, now hold me close
Baby, now hold me close
Baby, now hold me close
Baby, now hold me close
Baby, now hold me close

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I just want to take you there
He don't gotta know where
Does he touch you here like this, this, this, this?
Let me take the friction from your lips (Ooh woah)

In reference to his thoughts about his pending fame around the Trilogy era:

At the time, I thought Id be a punk star  grow my hair out, acne on my face, super-fucking-skinny. I was looking at artists like Iggy Pop and the Ramones, or Afropunk. But you evolve and realize your potential. And then its like, Fuck yeah. Lets go.

Title: The Hills (Eminem Remix)
Release Date: October 11, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-the-hills-eminem-remix-lyrics
Song Description: After Abels Wicked Games (off his debut mixtape, House of Balloons) was incorporated onto the Southpaw soundtrack, Abel returns the favour by letting the rap legend remix his monstrous hitThe Hills.

The unexpected collaboration between Slim Shady and the The Weeknd dropped alongside an additional remix to The Hills with Nicki Minaj.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Said you want a little company
And I love it, 'cause the thrill's cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still, if he knew I was here, he'd wanna kill me
(Kill me)
But it's time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn't always, will be
Your pill refill and I'll still be your addiction
You can touch a prescription, but don't fill me
I let you see my dark side
But like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly
We hit the flight deck and got sprung (Pew!)
Like an ejector seat from an F-15
But tonight, we don't need those pills
Just the effects of each other, but we gon' film
'Cause I will want your ex to see (Get it?)
That...

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
You might also like[Verse 2: Eminem]
And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And I'll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don't you know (Don't you know)
Remember when I told you (Told you)
I would never let down my guard?
And I hope you (Hope you)
Feel like dirt when I hold you (Hold you)
'Cause is it really over?
But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill-seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free, and still creep
But these hills see from their POV, we can touch
But the only way you'll film me is with a camera, feel me?
You're nothin' but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I'm a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep textin' me
But at night, if you seek those thrills, what I expect to be?
'Cause if you cheat on him
Just means I will be the next to be your ex
So no complexities, just sex
And don't lecture me, just accept that...
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Title: Real Life
Release Date: August 28, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-real-life-lyrics
Song Description: The Weeknd begins his 2015 album, Beauty Behind the Madness, with advice from his own mother on how his life was going to destroy him over time.

In this intro, we find Abel opening up about mistakes and claiming them as such, rather than in the storytelling aspect he has utilized during his career.

The songs pre-chorus is reminiscent of the bridge on Michael Jacksons Billie Jean,

People always told me be careful of what you do  And dont go around breaking young girls' hearts  And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth

Abel also mentions his relationship with his mother on the grandiose Echoes of Silence track The Fall.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Tell 'em this boy wasn't meant for lovin', uh
Tell 'em this heart doesn't stay to one
I'll be the same, never changed for nothin', uh
It's all I know, never learned much more

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama called me destructive, oh, yeah
Said it'd ruin me one day, yeah
'Cause every woman that loved me, oh, yeah
I seemed to push them away

[Chorus]
That's real life, oh, oh-oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh, oh-oh
That real life, real life, real life, real life (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I know you don't really understand it, uh
I'm not allowed to regret my choice, mm
I heard that love is a risk worth taking, uh
I wouldn't know, never been that boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama called me destructive, oh, yeah
Said it'd ruin me one day, yeah

Title: Echoes of Silence
Release Date: December 21, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-echoes-of-silence-lyrics
Song Description: A very melancholic yet powerful conclusion to the tape, The Weeknd presents the audience with a piercing question: is the girl the victim of this narrative, or is he?

When Trilogy was released, Till Dawn (Here Comes the Sun) replaced this track as the final Echoes of Silence song.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Talk to me, baby
Tell me what you're feeling
You say you don't need to go
Don't you pretend you didn't know
How all of this would end up?
Girl, I saw it in your eyes
And, baby, I can read your mind
And expectations were not in sight
You knew that talking dirty to me on the phone
Would get me here
'Cause we both wanted to do this
But I could tell that you were scared
'Cause you thought there was more to us
But you knew how this would end
It's gonna end how you expected
Girl, you're such a masochist
And I ask why
And you reply
I like the thrill
Nothing's gonna make me feel this real
So, baby, don't go home
I don't wanna spend tonight alone
Baby, please
Would you end your night with me?
Don't you leave me all behind
Don't you leave my little life
Don't you leave my little lie

Song Description: Scared To Live is a song by The Weeknd which first premiered on Saturday Night Live on March 8, 2020. The ballad details how a tragic breakup left his lover doubting love.

While the songs title was seemingly confirmed by XO CEO Wassim Sal Slaiby on his socials as Scared To Live Again, SNL confirmed the title as Scared To Live.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
When I saw the signs, I shoulda let you go (Yeah, yeah)
But I kept you beside me
And if I held you back, at least I held you close (Yeah)

Title: Valerie
Release Date: November 13, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-valerie-lyrics
Song Description: In this addition to the Thursday narrative, Abel sings about a girl, likely the Lonely Star, that he truly loves yet is cheating on.

This is the only song on Thursday, if not in the entire Trilogy, that seems to omit any significant references to drugs, alcohol, or indulging in sex. Thus, the audience may be safe in deriving the inference that this character singing, or the state Abel is in on this song, is different. He also personalizes this track by calling Valerie out by name.

While Valerie is aware that he is cheating, The Weeknd concludes that she will stay because she doesnt want to be alone. Ending this portion of the story with the upper hand, Abel stages a pivotal transition into the next project.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
There comes a time in a man's life
Where he must take responsibility
For the choices he has made
And there are certain things that he must do
Things that he must say

[Chorus]
Like I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd feel this kind of hesitation (To put)
My hand on another girl
I wish I didn't have to lie
I wish I could let you know

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true

[Bridge]
Valerie (Oh, Valerie)
I know you can see through me
(I know you can see through my lies)
Valerie (Oh, Valerie)
You just choose to never know
(No, you just don’t know what I do, what I do, oh, Valerie)
Valerie (Valerie, oh)
Why pretend to trust in me?
(I don't know why you try to trust in me baby, but I think I know)
Valerie (I know, Valerie)
You'd rather this than be alone

[Outro]
And I love you

And I need you

I only want you
And nobody gonna know...

Title: Secrets
Release Date: November 25, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-secrets-lyrics
Song Description: Secrets, initially inspired by Dolly Parton and Conway Twitty, finds Abel explaining that he can fully understand whats going on in the girls mind. A preview of the song appeared on the M A N I A visuals, released on the 23rd of November 2016, two days before the official release.

The track was initially meant as a country song, but later changed by Doc McKinney, Cirkut and Sir Dylan to a new-wave/soul styled version, marking one of The Weeknds new artificial styles.

The song has Abel singing lower notes than his famous falsetto, which he is used to. As the song continues, Abel slowly changes to a somewhat of a Transatlantic accent.

The track noticeably samples two well known New Wave songs. The entire chorus is an interpolation of The Romantics' Talking In Your Sleep, while the backing track also relies heavily on a sample of Tears For Fears' Pale Shelter.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Everybody here wants you
My love, my love
And I know that you want 'em too
My love, my love
I ask you what your heart desires
My love, my love
You tell me I'm the only one
My love, my love

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lies, your lies
Every time you close your eyes
[Chorus]
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

Title: Wanderlust
Release Date: March 31, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-wanderlust-lyrics
Song Description: Arguably the most Michael Jackson-esque song on the album, Wanderlust describes, aside from Abels own sexual desires, how misconstrued the idea of real love is today. Listen to the Pharrell remix of this song below:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV1AZwKduS8

This track samples Precious Little Diamond performed by Fox the Fox.

Since Abel refers to many modern music classics throughout this album (Fox the Fox, Portishead), the title is probably a reference to the classic Paul McCartney song.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Is it so hard to say the same thing?
And you're so weak to say the same thing
Burn a hole into your apprehensiveness
And let the wildfire shine
And repeat after me (like)
Good girls go to heaven
And bad girls go everywhere
And tonight I will love you
And tomorrow you won't care
[Bridge: Fox the Fox]

Title: The Birds Pt. 2
Release Date: August 18, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-the-birds-pt-2-lyrics
Song Description: After The Weeknd proclaims that the Thursday girl foolishly fell in love with a bird, one of the darkest, most eerie songs in Abels discography emerges.

A gun being loaded and fired, crying, and the calling of crows are all heard during this song. The Thursday girl appears to shoot something in response to Abels proclamation. What she targets is left in ambiguity, although it seems to be The Weeknd himself.

This song samples Martina Topley Birds song, Sandpaper Kisses, a song from the soundtrack of the video game Fahrenheit.
Lyrics:

[Crying/Gunshot]

[Intro]
Woah, with a nigga like me
Woah, with a nigga like me

[Verse 1]
She said "Please, mercy me, mercy me
Let me fall outta love, before you fuck her, before you fuck her"
She begged me, she gave me all her pills
Now my back hurts, she lost control

[Chorus]
Now she pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
Baby got her pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
She said it won't be long before she falls out of love
It won't be long before she falls out of love

[Post-Chorus: Martina Topley-Bird & The Weeknd]
Sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss
Don't know what this is, but it all leads to this
You're gonna leave her
You have deceived her
You're just a bird
Just a bird

But you never let me miss you
But you never let me miss you

And don't you fall for a nigga like me, I begged, I begged

[Chorus]
Now you're pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
Now you're pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
She said it won't be long before she falls out of love
It won't be long, before she falls out of love

[Post-Chorus: Martina Topley-Bird & The Weeknd]
Sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss (Oh, my love)
Don't know what this is, but it all leads to this
You're gonna leave her (If she only knew)
You have deceived her
You're just a bird

Title: Adaptation
Release Date: September 10, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-adaptation-lyrics
Song Description: Abel released a snippet from his acclaimed debut album Kiss Land on the 30th of August via YouTube with a very slurred video of him singing in the studio. It was also revealed the song features a sample from The Polices Bring On the Night.



The name of the snippet is Roman Polanski. This isnt the first time he used a filmmakers name in this way, however. He released a snippet of the song Kiss Land under the name John Carpenter. Both Roman Polanski and John Carpenter are movie directors, a connection that made more sense following Abels Complex interview. The entire album was inspired by filmmakers like John Carpenter who are great at making horror movies; the elements of horror from these films is what Abel desired to give Kiss Land.

Song lyrics below:
Lyrics:

[Intro]
When the sun comes up, you're searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us
[Sample]
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
As I bid yesterday goodbye

[Verse 1]
I lay my head on a thousand beds
It's been a test to see how far a man
Can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
I could've stayed

[Chorus]
But I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway
You might also like[Verse 2]
Adapted to these models
Who's adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay up ‘til tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in Love and War
She's pure

[Bridge]
So pure, like the love that's so uncut and raw
And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered

[Chorus]
Because I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway
[Bridge 2]
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
[Sample]
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye

Title: Professional
Release Date: September 10, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-professional-lyrics
Song Description: The intro to the opener for Kiss Land depicts the life of the entertainer   the professional  not necessarily a stripper. He also talks about the consumer/entertainer relationship, his own naivety, and the addiction of fame beyond the money.

The following verses detail the Weeknds professional relationship with a stripper, prostitute, etc. However, this relationship is not limited to the club.
Lyrics:

[Part I]

[Verse]
It's ideal, oh
You need someone to tell you how to feel
And you think your happiness is real
There's so much more the world has to reveal
But you choose to be concealed
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town?
I don't think you even know it
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town?
You made enough to quit a couple years ago
But it consumes you
It's everywhere you go
And just the thought alone got you trippin'
Got you losing your mind
And I don't blame you
It's everything you know
But I own this time, this ain't new
Now I decide when we're through
[Part II]
[Chorus]
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
We're professional

What does it mean, oh
When your heart's already numb?
You're professional
Won't treat it like it's personal
No, 'cause it's just love
It always makes its way back around
It's dispensable
To fall is unacceptable
'Cause everything you've been through made you stronger
And every day, you learn about yourself
And nothing really played out how it's s'posed to
Depending on somebody else's wealth
But now you know the value of a dollar
And girl, I make enough of it to spend
I love the way you put yourself together
I love the way you make that body bend
For me again, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
[Verse 2]
All of those nights you were up barely holding your own
Girl, you've got it made
Had you blaming yourself for when life did you wrong
Now, you've got it made
Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song
Girl, you've got it made
'Cause your freedom was here in this cage all along
Oooh, how'd you drain all the soul from your eyes?
How'd you teach, teach yourself how to smile
In a world where your dreams can't be real, no?
Every touch that you sell is a lie
[Chorus]
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
We're professional
We're professional120Embed

Release Date: August 20, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-live-for-lyrics
Song Description: On Live For, The Weeknd and Drake detail their party-oriented lifestyles with a somewhat defensive tone. This dualistic attitude is similar to the undertones present in prior collaboration Crew Love from Drakes 2011 album Take Care.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Getting sober for a day got me feeling too low (Oh)
They tryna make me slow down
Tryna tell me how to live, I'm about to lose control (Lose control, oh)

How long do you think it's gon' take for y'all to fall?
That's a serious question, 'cause I seriously question all of y'all
Been touring the world, man, I've done spent racks in all the malls
And they know my story, flaws and all
I still got plaques hanging wall to wall, dawg
She just offered a strip tease, but she don't look like Demi Moore
Hips all on 45, waist all on 24
And it's all love in the city, still scream, "XO!" when that Henny pour
But I'm that boy, not just any boy, what the fuck you think that I'm in it for?
Roll up in that thing, got hoes like Prince, but they know, I'm king
Chubbs might hold that thing, if he get caught, he'll be home by spring
Things I shouldn't share, I mean, for the sake of my career
I'm not tryna stunt, I'm just tellin' you the truth, I swear
This the shit that I live for with the people I'd die for

Title: Ordinary Life
Release Date: November 25, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-ordinary-life-lyrics
Song Description: Abel begins to express concern or regret about the drug-fueled, party-orientated life he is living on Ordinary Life. He acknowledges that he cannot, and does not, want to change the things he has done nor the way he is living.

The track features prominent religious imagery, contrasting with the life of excess and sin Abel is enjoying because of his fame.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Heaven in her mouth, got a hell of a tongue
I can feel her teeth when I drive on a bump
Fingers lettin' go of the wheel when I cum
Whe-wheel when I cum, whe-wheel when I cum
David Carradine, I'ma die when I cum (Die when I cum)
She just givin' head, she don't know what I done
Like I'm James Dean, I'ma die when I'm young (Die when I'm)
Die when I'm young (Die when I'm), die when I'm young

[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven knows that I've been told
Paid for the life that I chose
If I could, I'd trade it all
Trade it for a halo
Yeah, she said that she'll pray for me
I said it's too late for me
'Cause I think it's safe to say

[Chorus]
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life

Lyrics:

[Intro]
The wind in the sky
Please gather the clouds
And close the way of the wind
I need to make the beautiful dancer
Like a muse, so I can keep looking at her
Too bad if you forget about me
I have to live with it
We swear by God we will be together forever
Now I'm worried God will take your soul
Because you broke your promise
Like the fire which guards light up to search things
Burns up in the night
And fades into the daylight
Just as my love and thoughts of you
Burn in the night and fade into the sun

[Verse 1]
I know you want your money, girl
'Cause you do this every day, okay
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your gift of nonchalance
But nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch, well

When nobody ever could

[Chorus]
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world
You belong to the world

[Verse 2]
And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue, yeah
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment 'til my time is done, yeah
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile
In so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, oh baby
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a fool (I'm not a fool)
I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)
I'm not a fool, (Oh no) I'm just lifeless too (I'm just lifeless too)

Title: Pretty
Release Date: October 10, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-pretty-lyrics
Song Description: This consists as the ninth track of The Weeknds debut album, Kiss Land, which focuses on how Abel is cheated on by his partner and finds a new love. Also as confirmed on the David Letterman Show, The Weeknds Pretty is deeply influenced from, Phil Collins In the Air Tonight.

Published on September 20, 2013, the official video brings the songs story to life. The Weeknd departs from his flight, drives to purchase some flowers, and ultimately brings out his dark side by shooting his girlfriend and her lover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxilwT1sKSo

The video received a ton of backlash, specifically about its violent, graphic content of the sex scene and murder. As well as the criticism surrounding the glorification of guns, people have characterized instances of the video, and the artist himself, as misogynistic. In realty, the purpose was to create a revenge narrative disguised as a love story.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Somebody told me it was pointless for me to come back
Into your arms
Said you fucked another man
Finally, I knew this day would come
Whoa, oh-oh
'Cause I see fear in your eyes
You've been living out your life
As long as you know that when I land, you're mine
It's been exactly 365 since I've seen your face
I've been livin' on the road
And you've been livin' all alone at home
Girl, I hope, he made you satisfied (kimochi)
Well, baby, I won't cry
As long as you know that when I land, you're mine

[Chorus]
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there

[Verse 2]
There are certain things that I've come to understand
Expectations can kill a simple man, simple woman, woah
I try to master the art of that far away love
But only so much can keep a woman warm
Now it's times like this that I say to myself
We've been livin' in a cold, cold world, cold world
But at least I have you to rely
Even if for a short time
As long as you know that when I land, you're mine

Oh, when I make it there

(Breakdown)

[Chorus]
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there

Quand une putain de colombe blanche chante sa chanson

Embobiné dans ma toile, je les dévoile à nouveau
10 ans mon ami, que rien d'autre ne compte
Elle n'était qu'une gamine à ce moment
Souffrant d'un cœur brisé, une douleur très profonde

Title: As You Are
Release Date: August 28, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-as-you-are-lyrics
Song Description: As You Are is a song from The Weeknds second studio album, Beauty Behind the Madness. It is about being in a relationship that is clearly destined to fail. Both partners recognize their impending doom, but their young love causes them to be optimistic and blinds them from accepting their fate. Thus, they are allowing themselves to be hurt in the long run.

Abel is no stranger to this topic, writing songs such as The Knowing, Kiss Land, and Wicked Games with much of the same thesis.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]

There ain't nothin' wrong, you can pick and choose
Just don't call tomorrow askin' "What did I do?"

Do you feel like you did before?
Do you see the world getting small?
How does it feel, are you free?
As for me, I've been getting grown
As for me, I've been getting old
As for me, I’ve been flying around the world
I’ve been killing these shows
But I'm always getting high
Cause my confidence low
And I'm always in a rush
Ain't no time to fuck slow
And even if I try
It's not something I would know
But I'm sure I'll make you cum
Do it three times in a row
And I'm sure you would have left
Put that pussy in control
Got that pussy in control
I got it in control
Control, control, control

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
All she cares about is money
And the city where she's from
Her intention is the paper
She don't need no fucking love

Trying to pass me all these cups
Well, babygirl, I'm zoning
Somebody should've told her

Fuck it, I popped one
Oh girl, I'm on one
Fuck it, I popped one

Title: Losers
Release Date: August 28, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-losers-lyrics
Song Description: Losers serves as the second track of The Weeknds Beauty Behind the Madness as a duet between him and British singer Labrinth.

Abel dropped out of highschool at 17, along with his friend Lamar Taylor to pursue music. Even though The Weeknd and Labrinth use the same lyrics in their verses (Labrinth isnt a high school dropout)  they represent The Weeknd & Lamar making the bold decision to leave and chase their dreams. Throughout the song, they take turns reflecting on their wisdom as they reminisce about their ambitions and careers.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Only losers go to school
I taught myself how to move
I'm not the type to count on you, uh
'Cause stupid's next to "I love you"
No?

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
[So what can you show me
That my heart don't know already? ('Dy)
We make our own sense
And you're qualified to me
What can you show me
That my heart don't know already? ('Dy)
We make our own sense

[Post-Chorus: The Weeknd, Labrinth]
And you're qualified to (Oh, oh)
And you're qualified to (Oh, oh, oh)
And you're qualified to

[Verse 2: Labrinth]

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
And now that we're all grown up
Who do we owe it to?
And now that we've gone this far
Who do we owe it all to?
We did it all alone
Now we're coming for the throne
We did it all alone
Now we're coming for the throne
And now that we all came up
Do we lose? Do we lose?
[Chorus: The Weeknd]]
So what can you show me

Title: Out of Time
Release Date: January 7, 2022, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-out-of-time-lyrics
Song Description: The Weeknd flips a City Pop classic, sampling the 1983 song Midnight Pretenders by Japanese artist Tomoko Aran, and goes introspective on Out of Time. The track features a distressed Abel, as he realizes the mistakes he made in his relationship and croons for a second chance on the sleek, sensual sounding cut.

As some fans noticed on Reddit, Out of Time has also a very similar song structure to the artists 2016 hit song I Feel It Coming, so much that the two tracks can be almost entirely overlapped with each other.

After teasing stills of the music video on Twitter, the video was released on April 6, 2022, featuring actors Jim Carrey and Hoyeon.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
The last few months, I've been workin' on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby
I look back now and I realize

[Pre-Chorus]
And I remember when I held you
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind

[Chorus]
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)

[Verse 2]
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Give me one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like I shoulda loved you all the time

And I remember when I held you (Held you, baby)
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay (Never again, baby)

You made up your mind (Uh)

[Chorus]
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time (No)
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time (Hey)
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)

[Outro: The Weeknd & Tomoko Aran]
Ooh, singin', out of time
Said I had you to myself, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Uh)
Out of time (Pretend—)
Out of time (Pretend—)

[Spoken Outro: Jim Carrey]
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever
Here's thirty minutes of easy listening to some slow tracks

Title: The Fall
Release Date: December 21, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-the-fall-lyrics
Song Description: Almost a spiritual successor to the 7th track on House of Balloons, Coming Down, The Fall  sees Abel discussing a lack of fear for the worst case scenario, since hes already been through the worst.

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Abel specifically cites the hook of this song in discussing his mindset on coming up:

I have this lyric that goes, Im not scared of the fall/Ive felt the ground before. And in this industry, Im not really scared of failing, because I already know what it means to be on the ground.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You been picking my voice to dance to
You say my money no good in here
Even though I didn't ask you
And it's the most you've worked
Even though I probably don't deserve this girl
But you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
Baby, it's OK
I got show money, baby
I wanna show you how I blow money, baby
I wanna show you how I throw money, baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
Cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted
Got some trappers in my car
What kind of caps I got the brownest of them all
Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all, before we pop 'em all

[Hook]
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good

I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I've felt the ground before
I've felt the ground before
I've felt the ground before
I've felt the ground before
Cuz I ain't scared of the fall

Mama, I understand why you're mad
And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live
And what I do
But I've been good since Thursday
Yes I've been good since Thursday

So you can watch my love vanish
In a girl with no talent
But to make mula vanish
Call her friend for my friend
And friends name's Lexus
I let my niggas test it
Her morals worth a cent
And best believe I already spent it
My blunt full of B.C
My cup full of Texas
Flown on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you ain't gotta ask "Who's next? Who's next?"

[Hook]
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I've felt the ground before
I've felt the ground before

Title: Outside
Release Date: December 21, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-outside-lyrics
Song Description: In Outside, Abel describes a drug-filled sexual encounter with a woman, who had recently broken up with her boyfriend. Enticing her with every syllable within his words, The Weeknd paints a picture of what sex is like with him. He not only describes his sexual encounter, but creates a metaphor for his listeners. Once you start listening to his music, you are automatically trapped.



On the production, Illangelo proves that any sample can be turned into a literal work of art. With remnants of Cults Go Outside used in the background, the perfect dream-like atmosphere is set. The Weeknd can do nothing but add his own brilliance to the song.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'll let you show me his moves
Let you do what he taught you
Let you reminisce how you used to do
Girl, I’m open to anything that'll get you into that zone
And understand that we’re all alone
So you can slowly take off your clothes
Baby girl, you know what's in store
And baby I will stay up all night
I've been goin' hard since last night
And I'ma go harder tonight
Wish you could see you through my eyes
Ooh, I'm telling you this ain't the same
And I know he's still in your brain
I'm 'bout to burn that shit into flames
Once I'm in you, baby

[Chorus]
Forget what you know
Make yourself at home
'Cause baby when I'm finished with ya
You won't wanna go outside

[Verse 2]
And I'ma work you like a pro, baby
Why, and you gon' take it like one
Yeah, you gon' take it like one
And I'ma give it like you asked for it
Why, 'cause you been talkin' 'bout it
I know you talkin' 'bout it
Ooh, baby, when I'm done with you, why
You ain't saying nothing
Yeah, you ain't saying nothing
Ooh, baby, when I'm done with you, why
You ain't saying nothing
Yeah, you ain't saying nothing
You gon' make me show off
All the pain that you feel you can tell
That we ain't making no love
But I'll pretend, oh girl, I'll pretend
If you pretend then, girl, I'll pretend
Let's make it seem like we're all we need in the end

Release Date: September 10, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-tears-in-the-rain-lyrics
Song Description: Final song on the standard edition of The Weeknds debut studio album, Kiss Land.

The Weeknd has mentioned that this album was heavily influenced by the movie Blade Runner, with this songs title actually coming from a scene in the movie:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTCV5BJiOhY
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain, hmm)

[Verse 1]
When it's said and done
I already felt love
And I let it end up
End up dying by itself
And when it's said and done
You were better off
You deserve real love
And I deserve to be by myself
'Cause I've gone too far
And I started too young
To give up
And even if I changed
It would be too late
I exposed my ways
Now every girl I touch

Embrace all that comes (Embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (Alone you've become)
They all feel the same

[Verse 2]
I should've let you leave
But I let you watch me slip away
I could've set you free
But I'm selfish
I watched you stay, oh, yeah

[Bridge]
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me

[Chorus]
They all feel the same (Ooh)
Adjust to the fame (Adjust to the fame, baby)
'Cause no one will love you like her (No one could love me)
It's pointless (No one's gonna love me)
Like tears in the rain (No one can love no more)
So now that she's gone (Oh, now that she's gone, baby)
Embrace all that comes (Oh, embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (I'm not gonna show the world, oh, how alone I've become, oh)
They all feel the same (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
Adjust to the fame (Ohh, adjust to the fame, I ain't tryin' to be alone, baby)
'Cause no one will love you like her (No one's gonna love you no more)
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
So now that she's gone (Ooh, baby, no one's gonna love me no more)

Title: D.D.
Release Date: December 21, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-dd-lyrics
Song Description: The opener to Echoes of Silence is The Weeknds rendition of Michael Jacksons classic, Dirty Diana, but with an even darker vibe.

Like the original song, Abel experiences the struggles of dealing with groupie love, especially when hes supposed to already have something going with a girl from the previous projects in the Trilogy.

The Weeknd spoke with L.A. Times about how Dirty Diana influenced his artistry:

Dirty Diana is my favorite song of all time, it is literally my No. 1. It takes all these genres and it puts it into one song  rock, experimental, hip-hop, R&B. Its why I wanted to write these dope songs.

In select live performances involving this track, The Weeknd performed a version merging this song with Beauty Behind the Madness single In the Night.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no, oh no

[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay so take your head off of me
I know your every move, so won't you please let me be?
I've been here times before but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time you won't seduce me...
She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby, do what you please
I am the stuff that you want, I am the thing that you need."
She looked me deep in the eyes, she touchin' me so to start...
She say, "There's no turnin' back," she trapped me in her heart!

[Hook]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no...!
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
(Oh no...) (Oh no...) (Oh no...)

[Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtains come down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far
I'll be your everything if you make me a star."

[Hook]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no...
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, let me be!
(Oh no...) (Oh no...) (Oh no...)

[Verse 3]
She said, "I have to go home ‘cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleepin' alone, why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright."
Diana walked up to me, she said, "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone sayin', "Baby I'm alright."
I said, "Unlock the door cause I forgot the key!"
She said, "He's not coming back because he's sleeping with me!"

[Hook]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no (Dirty Di-)

Title: Is There Someone Else?
Release Date: January 7, 2022, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-is-there-someone-else-lyrics
Song Description: Is There Someone Else? is the tenth track on The Weeknds fifth studio album, Dawn FM. This song was highly anticipated, for it was first seen as a snippet on his Instagram on January 3, 2022.

In this track, The Weeknd asks his lover if there is someone else she is involved with other than him. Although he hints that he has not been loyal in his past relationships, he claims that he changed and begs her to be with him forever.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I know that you're hiding something from me
That's been close to your heart
And I felt it creepin' up every day
Baby, right from the start
I know that look you give when we're fighting (Fighting)
We're fighting (Fighting)
'Cause I used to be the one who was lying (Lying)
Oh, lying (Lying)

[Chorus]
Oh, is there someone else or not?
'Cause I wanna keep you close
I don't wanna lose my spot
'Cause I need to know
If you're hurting him, or you're hurting me
If I ain't with you, I don't wanna be
Is there someone else or not?
Ooh, or not?

[Verse 2]
I don't deservе someone loyal to me
Don't you think I see?
And I don't want to bе a prisoner to who I used to be
I swear I changed my ways for the better, the better
'Cause I wanna be with you forever, forever

Ooh, or not?

Title: Nothing Without You
Release Date: November 25, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-nothing-without-you-lyrics
Song Description: Nothing Without You differs from other Starboy songssuch as Rockin' and Party Monsterin that Abel admits to loving this girl, and wanting to stay together with her. Abel credits his lover for making him who he is today, whether that be his fame, his character or even his music.

The appearance of Nothing Without You on Starboy is well timed; just over a week before the release rumours began to circulate about Bella Hadid and Abel splitting up.

On the April 4th, 2014 Abel teased the song in a tweet:

https://twitter.com/theweeknd/status/451931213142691840
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I realized I belong to you
I feel the darkness when away from you, hey yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stop your lovin', walk out on me
Don't stop for nothin', you're what I bleed
I learned to love you, the way you need
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same

[Chorus]
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin')
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin') Yeah
I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(Nothin', nothin', nothin')

[Verse 2]
Pick up your phone, I got a question, oh
If I die tonight, would you regret it? Woah-woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stop your lovin', it's all I have
'Cause I can't function, no, I won't last
I swear I'll love you just like the past
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same

The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you

[Outro]
When I feel the love, girl, I hesitate
It's what I'm guilty of, oh yeah
I can't get enough, I'm insane
Without your touch, touch, touch
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'

Title: Till Dawn (Here Comes The Sun)
Release Date: November 13, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-till-dawn-here-comes-the-sun-lyrics
Song Description: Continuing the ambiguity of the previous song, Abel concludes the Trilogy on a rather triumphant note for both himself and Valerie. While both parties feel as though they are leaving the relationship as the independent instead of the dependent, both also leave a window open for the other to run back to them. This is as close to an emotional attachment as we hear throughout the Trilogy, because its almost as if neither wants the other to find somebody to love.

Ending the Trilogy on the break of dawn is also an interesting paradox in itself; the dramatic events of this project were immersed in the night and can finally close as a new, peaceful morning ensues. In an interview with Beats 1, Abel said that such darkness is good to have because when the light comes it feels that much better.

This song also continues an underlying theme of Abels imminent rise to the mainstream, as he notes that he already knows what to prepare for from his fans.

The third teaser for Trilogy includes this song as audio, showcasing what could be Valerie trying to outrun the lights of a chasing car, or the Sun. The image painted here draws another allusion to David Lynchs Lost Highway.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I tell myself that I'll take you for the last time
I'll be over you eventually
Time after time, you seem to brush me off
I understand what we have become
You wash your neck when you leave, now I know your routine
I was in love with your mystery
Now I'll just take what I can get from you
I'm not embarrassed to be what you want me to be

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide
I don't pretend to have any shame
I got a box you can put all your lies in
Until the end of days
You know that I will be a call away
The call you'll make when you're all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done

[Chorus]
Well, here comes the sun
And you're in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you'll stay through the night
You might also like[Verse 2]
You just wanna fill the void now
I can tell that you've been yelling at him all night long
And I can hear it in your voice now
He got you smoking extra packs a day
Don't you worry 'bout me talking
I know why you've been coming
I'll be quiet, this ain't nothing to me
Just wrap your legs around my waist
I won't stop until you ask me
Don't you worry 'bout us messing up my sheets

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide
I don't pretend to have any shame
I got a box you can put all your lies in
Until the end of days, ooh
You know that I will be a call away
The call you'll make when you're all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done

[Chorus]
Well, here comes the sun
And you're in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you'll stay through the night
Well, here comes the sun
And you're in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you'll stay through the night (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Bridge]
You're gonna hate him then you'll want me
Then you'll miss him (Girl), then you'll hate me
Girl, I know you so well (Girl, I know you so well)
Girl, I know your routine (Yes, I know your routine)
You're gonna hate him (Hate him), then you'll want me (Want me)
Then you'll miss him (Baby), then you'll hate me
Girl, I know you so well (Girl, I know you so well)
Girl, I know your routine (Ooh, woah)

Well, here comes the sun (Baby)
And you're in my arms (Oh yeah)
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance (Oh)
That you'll stay through the night (Yeah)
Well, here comes the sun (Ooh)
And you're in my arms (Oh)
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance

Release Date: January 7, 2022, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-less-than-zero-lyrics
Song Description: Less Than Zero is the fifteenth track from The Weeknds fifth studio album, following the success of his previous album, After Hours.

On the disco-pop track, Abel sings about the way a girl that he used to be romantically involved with perceives him now, as less than zero.

As the cinephile Abel is, the title is likely a nod to the 1987s Less Than Zero, starred by Robert Downey Jr. who plays Clay, a regretful 18-year-old freshman that returns to Los Angeles for a compressing and horrorful winter break.

This considerably serves as the outro of the album, as the next track, Phantom Regret by Jim is a spoken-word interlude by comedian and movie star Jim Carrey, who narrated the album and does not contain any of Weeknds vocals.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Remember I was your hero, yeah
I'd wear your heart like a symbol
I couldn't save you from my darkest truth of all
I know
I'll always be less than zero
Oh, yeah
You tried your best with me, I know
I couldn't face you with my darkest truth of all
Oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't shake this feeling that crawls in my bed
I try to hide it, but I know you know me
I try to fight it, but I'd rather be free
Oh

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah
Can we meet in the middle?
Oh yeah
'Cause you were just like me before
Now you'd rather leavе me
Than to watch me die in your arms, oh

Lyrics:

You love it when I always squeeze
It's 5 AM, I'm high again
And you can see that I'm in pain (Ooh, ooh)
I've fallen into emptiness
I want you 'cause we're both insane
I'm staring into the abyss
I'm lookin' at myself again
I'm dozing off to R.E.M.
I'm trying not to lose my faith

[Chorus]
And I love it when you watch me sleep
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me

In this game called life, we are not free

Title: Until I Bleed Out
Release Date: March 20, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-until-i-bleed-out-lyrics
Song Description: Until I Bleed Out describes the end of Abels journey throughout After Hours, with the records ending signifying that Abels body has run out of blood. He has given every last ounce of effort and emotion he can to the ventures he has undergone over the course of the records track listing, leaving him unable to keep pushing further for his relationship that he constantly talks about on the record.

The song title may relate to the albums concept and journey through Las Vegas, where all of the visual references released in the rollout of After Hours (excluding the cover arts of the first two singles) feature Abel bloody and injured.

The track was first previewed in a snippet on March 18, 2020 posted to his social media accounts that was revealed to be the track by music-identifying app Shazam.

A music video for the track was released on April 7, 2020.

In the video, Abel is seen at a party surrounded by balloons and confetti. This alludes to the House of Balloons, Abels first mixtape. Now, however, the balloons are colored, representing the glamour of Abels life as an incredibly successful artist. Yet even after achieving super-stardom, Abel finds himself in a familiar setting, the house of balloons. This can be seen as a full circle moment for Abel, where the closing track of his latest album After Hours brings him back to the place where it all began. Now, he has a decision to make  does he fall back to his old ways, or does he finally break free of his addictions?

The last scene of the video shows Abel escaping the party and watching in horror as another paralyzed version of Abel (one who chooses to stick to his old ways) is getting torn apart by people (Abels addictions) on a spinning platform in the center of the room. This escape from the house of balloons is Abels attempt to pave a new path in his life rather than going through the motions all over again and getting trapped in the vortex of hedonism.

Abel stumbles out of the party into the desert surrounding the Las Vegas Strip, then falls to the ground out of sheer exhaustion from trying to break away from the life he has known for far too long. In the isolation of the desert, he bleeds out, while the other Abel, paralyzed in the house of balloons, torn apart by his own addictions, meets the same fate.

Abels escape from the house of balloons wasnt enough. As he lies in the middle of the desert, bleeding out, Abel Tesfaye is Alone Again.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I can't move, I'm so paralyzed
I'm so paralyzed
I can't explain why I'm terrified
I'm so terrified

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I don't wanna touch the sky no more
I just wanna feel the ground when I'm coming down
It's been way too long
And I don't even wanna get high no more
I just want it out of my life
Out of my life, out

[Chorus]
I wanna cut you outta my dreams
'Til I'm bleeding out
'Til I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my mind
'Til I'm bleeding out
'Til I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my dreams
Woah, I'm bleeding out
Girl, I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my mind
'Cause I'm bleeding out
Oh, I'm bleeding

Title: Here We Go... Again
Release Date: January 7, 2022, URL: https://genius.com/The-weeknd-here-we-go-again-lyrics
Song Description: In Here We Go Again, Tyler, The Creator and The Weeknd pair up for the first time ever on a song, as they portray a story of caution in regards to the dark side of love and how its consuming beauty makes it impossible to avoid.

Notably, The Weekend did express a desire to work with Tyler in an August 2021 GQ interview. As the collaboration was likely well on its way at the time, it is possible he was trying to hint at it in the interview.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Strike a pose with my kinfolk
Front page of the billboards
Suit and tie and cigar smokes
Macallan shots 'til it burn throats
We still celebratin' Super Bowl
Catalog lookin' legendary
Ring froze like it's February
XO, that's a mercenary
A quarter bill on an off-year
Used to sing on lofts
But now we cruisin' on a yacht, we clear, yeah
Said you wanted your boyfriend jealous with a couple pics
And you didn't expect to fall for me once you got this dick
The city dark, city dangerous
Your girlfriend's tryna pair you with somebody more famous
But instead you ended up with someone so basic, faceless
Someone to take your pictures and frame it
And my new girl, she a movie star
My new girl, she a movie star
I loved her right, make her scream like Neve Campbell
But when I make her laugh, swear it cures my depressin' thoughts
'Cause baby girl, she a movie star
Baby girl, she a movie star
I told myself that I'd never fall
But here we go again

But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Although this love is strong to me
Some things can change, go wrong with me
We don't know how it's gonna be
Forever is too long to me
We don't need the government involved because we like to touch
We don't need no damn religion tellin' us that we in love
But if we did crush down the road, spendin' lawyer fees up
Pen and pad gon' save my ass if these feelings freeze up
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ooh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all

Hey
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, hey

Why would you wanna bring somethin' between us?
There's nothin' between us, oh, ayy, ayy
Why would you wanna use a life to keep us?
To keep us together, oh woah, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Better when we're both apart (Oh)
Better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other
No good for each other
Better when we're both apart (My baby)
Better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other

[Chorus]
A lonely night
Baby girl, I loved you on a lonely night, oh
It was the only time
And if I led you on, then I apologize
