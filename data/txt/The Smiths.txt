Artist: The Smiths
Artist Description: On August 31, 1978, while attending a Patti Smith concert, a fourteen-year-old Johnny Marr was introduced to nineteen-year-old Morrissey. Almost four years later, in May 1982, Marr would appear at Morrissey’s doorstep with his friend Steve Pomfret and offer a position in a new band he wished to form. The two spent the next few hours discussing their love for certain bands and the next day Morrissey confirmed that he was interested in forming a group with Marr.

They went on to write a handful of songs together—“Don’t Blow Your Horn,” “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,” and “Suffer Little Children,” respectively. Morrissey composed lyrics while Marr provided guitar instrumentation and Stephen Pomfret provided bass. Several months later, Marr and Morrissey had a name for their band: The Smiths. According to Morrissey in a 1984 interview, he had come up with the name as a shoutout to the ordinary people of the world. The group would continue to rehearse until Pomfret reportedly left out of frustration. Pomfret was quickly replaced with bassist Dale Hibbert, and because of his deeper connections with the music industry, The Smiths were able to record their first set of demos with drummer Simon Wolstencroft. Wolstencroft expressed his disinterest in continuing to play with the group and, after several auditions, Mike Joyce was hired.

In October 1982, The Smiths played their first official live show at The Ritz in Manchester. After the gig, Marr and Morrissey expressed their disappointment with Hibbert’s playing and he was forced out of the band, later to be replaced with Morrissey’s classmate, Andy Rourke.

After being rejected by several labels, Morrissey and Marr went to London to deliver a demo cassette to Geoff Travis, the founder of the independent label Rough Trade Records. Travis agreed to release one of the songs—“Hand in Glove”—and it was subsequently issued as a single later in the year. While the band played their second official live show at the University of London Union, broadcaster John Walters was in the audience—from the John Peel BBC Sessions. The group was invited to play and the band’s radio exposure was enough for them to be signed to Rough Trade. Several recordings from the Peel Sessions would later be issued on their 1984 compilation, Hatful of Hollow.

On February 20, 1984, The Smiths released their self-titled debut album. The project was both a critical and commercial success, but was met with controversy over some seemingly disturbing or distasteful lyrics, as the final song was a haunting tribute to the victims of the Moors Murders which took place twenty years prior to its release.

Less than a year later, The Smiths released Meat Is Murder; an album that was more politically charged than their previous effort. Just like their first album, Meat Is Murder was met with controversy due to Morrissey’s interviews that occurred during its promotional period. Despite the controversy, the band would continue to tour around the United Kingdom and the United States, eventually recording what is considered to be their masterpiece, June 1986’s The Queen Is Dead. The instrumentation proved to be more diverse, as Marr would implement string-like sounds on certain tracks—namely “There Is a Light That Never Goes Out.” In the US, The Queen Is Dead peaked at #70 and remained on the charts for 37 weeks.

After the album’s release, the band hired Craig Gannon as a secondary guitarist. Gannon would accompany the group on several singles, such as “Ask,” “Panic,” and “Half a Person.” It was also around this time that the Smiths became upset with treatment at Rough Trades and their partnership dissolved, leading the band to sign exclusively to EMI. The Smiths’ final studio album, Strangeways, Here We Come, was released on September 28, 1987, and by then the band had already broken up due to exhaustion and tension between members. Strangeways, Here We Come was met with commercial and critical success, charting in both the United States and the United Kingdom.

Each member of The Smiths went on to have their own successful solo career. Morrissey’s albums, in particular, have sold millions of copies, and Johnny Marr would form several bands and work with other artists—namely Modest Mouse on their March 2007 album, We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank, where he provided guitar instrumentation. Rourke went on to join several other groups—some alongside Joyce—and became a radio host. The Smiths have notably influenced other rock bands such as The Stone Roses, Oasis, and more.

Title: There Is a Light That Never Goes Out
Release Date: June 16, 1986, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out-lyrics
Song Description: There Is a Light That Never Goes Out is a sacred Smiths classic by now, one that makes fans across the globe join hands and mope together. To some it is a depressive anthem, to others a hopeful testament of love; perhaps its a theme song for teenage angst. The truth is that this song is essentially an artistic horoscope, giving each listener their own personal connection to the same soundbite.

The song was the second single off of The Smiths' 1986 album The Queen Is Dead (subsequently re-released as a single six years after the album was released). The fan favourite has stood out for its ideal balance of Morrisseys irreplaceable voice and lyricism and the ingenious guitar ability of Johnny Marr.

The song became The Smiths' second song to top BBC Radio One DJ John Peels Festive Fifty poll in his 1986 edition. As a single, the song reached number 25 on the UK Singles Chart.

The song has been referenced in multiple works of art, such as the novel Trainspotting, the movie (500) Days of Summer and the TV series Orange is the New Black. Multiple artists have also covered it, including superfan Noel Gallagher and Miley Cyrus.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see lights
Driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more

[Chorus]
And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

[Verse 2]
Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought "Oh God, my chance has come at last"
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask
Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car, I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one
La-dee-dum, oh, I haven't got one
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Oh, there is a light and it never goes out

Title: This Charming Man
Release Date: October 31, 1983, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-this-charming-man-lyrics
Song Description: This Charming Man is The Smiths' second single ever, depicting the story of a poor boy coming in contact with an upper class man and feeling unwelcome due to his lack of material wealth. The ambiguity of the characters' sexuality leaves the song very open to debate and speculation about the true meaning, pointing towards a homosexual relationship between the two characters.

The song was included as a bonus track on the cassette version of the bands debut album and subsequently on all American versions, including streaming.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexity
When the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"

[Chorus]
Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

[Verse 2]
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear

Title: I Know It’s Over
Release Date: June 16, 1986, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-i-know-its-over-lyrics
Song Description: I Know Its Over is a ballad for the desperate and lonely. It uses basic allusions to the idea of loneliness producing despair, but the attention to the speakers ego, and how it leads to his demise, creates an original take on heartbreak through the mind of Morrissey.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Oh, Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said

[Chorus]
I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over

[Verse 2]
Oh, Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me, the knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though she needs you more than she loves you

[Chorus]
And I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over and over and over and over, over and over
I know it's over, and it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said

Why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know, 'cause tonight is just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they're in each other's arms"

[Bridge]
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
Over, over, over, over
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate

Love is natural and real
But not for you, my love

But not for such as you and I

Title: Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now
Release Date: May 21, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-heaven-knows-im-miserable-now-lyrics
Song Description: This is a typical Morrissey song about a person who is upset or depressed, and doesnt want to waste any more time on thoughtless people. It was released as a single backed with Suffer Little Children and is one of The Smiths' best-known songs.

The title is a nod to the Sandie Shaw song Heaven Knows Im Missing Him Now.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

[Chorus]
In my life, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care
If I live or die?

[Verse 2]
Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

[Chorus]
In my life, oh, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care
If I live or I die?

[Verse 3]

Title: Bigmouth Strikes Again
Release Date: May 22, 1986, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-bigmouth-strikes-again-lyrics
Song Description: Bigmouth Strikes Again was the lead single from The Queen Is Dead,  reaching #26 in the UK singles chart.

One of Mozs most distinguishable features is his Bigmouth blabbering in the media interviews outside of the music. Such comments are still amassing controversy in his solo career to this day
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Sweetness, sweetness
I was only joking when I said
I'd like to smash every tooth in your head
Oh-oh, sweetness, sweetness
I was only joking when I said
By rights you should be bludgeoned in your bed

Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt (Ah)

Title: How Soon Is Now?
Release Date: January 28, 1985, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-how-soon-is-now-lyrics
Song Description: Sire Records chief Seymour Stein called it the Stairway to Heaven of the Eighties, while co-writer Johnny Marr described it as possibly our most enduring record. Its most peoples favourite, I think. Despite its prominent place in The Smiths' repertoire, however, it is not generally considered to be representative of the bands style.

Although a club favourite, How Soon Is Now? did not chart as well as writers Morrissey and Marr had expected. Most commentators put this down to the fact that the song had been out on vinyl in a number of forms before being released as a single in its own right. The original track runs for nearly seven minutes; however, the 7" single edit cut the length down to under four minutes. The complete version is generally used on compilations. The song has been widely praised for the artistry of its lyrics.

The heavily-reverbed riff that propels the song is a wonderfully repurposed version of Bo Diddleys Who Do You Love.
Lyrics:

[Intro]

[Verse]
I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular

[Chorus]
You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

Title: This Night Has Opened My Eyes
Release Date: November 12, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-this-night-has-opened-my-eyes-lyrics
Song Description: This Night Has Opened My Eyes is inspired by and retells the events of the play A Taste of Honey by Shelagh Delaney, as Morrissey told interviewers at NME in the 7th June 1986 issue:

At least 50 per cent of my reason for writing can be blamed on Shelagh Delaney who wrote A Taste Of Honey. And This Night Has Opened My Eyes is a Taste Of Honey song  putting the entire play to words.

The song is featured on two of the Smiths' compilation albums: Hatful of Hollow and Louder Than Bombs.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
In a river the color of lead
Immerse the baby's head
Wrap her up in The News Of The World
Dump her on a doorstep, girl
This night has opened my eyes
And I will never sleep again

[Verse 2]
You kicked and cried like a bullied child
A grown man of twenty-five
Oh, he said he'd cure your ills
But he didn't and he never will
Oh, save your life
Because you've only got one

[Chorus]
The dream has gone
But the baby is real
Oh, you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or she could have been a fool
Oh, you did a bad thing
And I'm not happy and I'm not sad

Title: The Queen is Dead
Release Date: June 16, 1986, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-the-queen-is-dead-lyrics
Song Description: The Queen is Dead parodies media fascination with the royal family over bombastic guitar bursts and an aggressive bass line. Officially listed on physical tracklist as The Queen Is Dead / Take Me Back To Dear Old Blighty (Medley).

In a 2015 Reddit AMA interview, Noel Gallagher has named this track as one of his favourite Smiths songs.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
"Oh, take me back to dear old Blighty
Put me on the train for London Town
Take me anywhere, drop me anywhere
In Liverpool, Leeds or Birmingham, but I don't care
I should like to see—"

[Drum Solo]

[Verse 1]
(I don't bless them)
Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between archers
Her very lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry, but it sounds like a wonderful thing
I say, Charles, don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your mother's bridal veil?
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
And so I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the eighteenth pale descendent
Of some old queen or other
Oh, has the world changed or have I changed?
Oh, has the world changed or have I changed?
Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to God, I swear I never even knew what drugs were
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

And talk about precious things
But when you are tied to your mother's apron
No one talks about castration

[Verse 4]
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(These are the things that kill me)
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair, oh-oh-oh

All their lies about makeup and long hair are still there

[Verse 5]
Past the pub that saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the pub that wrecks your body
And the church, all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb

Life is very long when you're lonely

Title: Cemetry Gates
Release Date: June 16, 1986, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-cemetry-gates-lyrics
Song Description: Right after one of the bleakest songs in Smiths' history, we get this jangly, up-beat contradiction of a song that takes a frolicing tone through the cemetery.

This song recounts a few of Morrisseys memories of visiting the enormous Southern Cemetery in Manchester with one of his best friends: Linder Sterling.

Morrissey stated in a video regarding his youth that these long walks provided the mental outlet he so desired to escape everything and find inspiration.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

[Verse 1]
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives
Where are they now?
With-a loves and hates and passions just like mine
They were born, and then they lived
And then they died
Seems so unfair, I want to cry

[Verse 2]
You say, "'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn"
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times, maybe less, maybe more

[Verse 3]
If you must write prose and poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take on loan
'Cause there's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs when you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall

You say, "'Ere long done do does did"
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text from whence was ripped

[Chorus]
A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetery gates
Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side, but you lose
'Cause whale blubber Wilde is on m-mine (Sugar)

Title: Asleep

Song Description: Asleep tells of the narrators desire to die. In his pain and sorrow, he wishes to be comforted as he drifts peacefully into death.

The song was originally released as the b-side for the single The Boy With The Thorn In His Side, and was later released in the compilation albums The World Wont Listen and Louder Than Bombs.

The song is also known for being the first track on the fictional mixtape One Winter created by Charlie, the protagonist and main character of the coming-of-age novel The Perks of Being A Wallflower.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Sing me to sleep, sing me to sleep
I'm tired and I, I want to go to bed
Sing me to sleep, sing me to sleep
And then leave me alone
Don't try to wake me in the morning
'Cause I will be gone

[Chorus]
Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I will feel so glad to go

[Verse 2]
Sing me to sleep, sing me to sleep
I don't want to wake up on my own anymore
Sing to me, sing to me
I don't want to wake up on my own anymore

[Chorus]
Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I really want to go

Song Description: For those unwilling to accept this is about breasts  or at least sexual shapes, at the 1986 Queen Is Dead tour Artists Against Apartheid concert, the only time The Smiths performed this song live, Morrissey added another verse at the end:

On the shop floor

From the ice age to the dole age
There is but one concern
I have just discovered

Title: Panic
Release Date: July 21, 1986, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-panic-lyrics
Song Description: This song was written by Morrissey and Johnny Marr and is the first song to be recorded with the new member at the time, Craig Gannon. The song is influenced by the T.Rex song Metal Guru musically, with Marr using similar guitar chords.

The repetition of Hang the DJ and the lyric, Burn down the disco intrigued listeners, making this song extremely popular. However, although the song has received negative reviews from critics, one of them, Nick Kent, calls the song a commission for rock terrorism.

NME placed Panic at number 21 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever in 2007.

Some believe this song is the inspiration for the name of the pop-rock band Panic! At the Disco, however, this is not true.

Panic also served as inspiration for a 2017 episode of Black Mirror, which drew its title from the chorus of the song  Hang the DJ.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again?
The Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself

[Verse 2]
Hopes may rise on the Grasmere
But, honey pie, you're not safe here
So you run down to the safety of the town
But there's panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself

Burn down the disco
Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music that they constantly play
It says nothing to me about my life
Hang the blessed DJ

Provincial towns you jog 'round

Title: Frankly, Mr. Shankly
Release Date: June 16, 1986, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-frankly-mr-shankly-lyrics
Song Description: Frankly, Mr. Shankly is a lark, an ambitious gofers resignation set to a light melody reminiscent of the Kinks. While referencing a real-life disagreement, this also calls back to a consistent theme throughout the album: resentment and emptiness caused by  fulfillment of desire and success. It corrodes his soul because it pays his way, not in spite of it.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way, and it corrodes my soul
I want to leave, you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, I'm a sickening wreck
I've got the twenty-first century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history, Mr. Shankly

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Fame, fame, fatal fame
It can play hideous tricks on the brain
But still I'd rather be famous than righteous or holy
Any day, any day, any day
But sometimes I'd feel more fulfilled
Making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to live and I want to love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of

[Verse 3]
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way, and it corrodes my soul
Oh, I didn't realise that you wrote poetry
I didn't realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry, Mr. Shankly
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, since you ask
You are a flatulent pain in the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
Still, I must speak frankly, Mr. Shankly
Oh, give us your money!You might also like13Embed

Title: Reel Around the Fountain
Release Date: February 20, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-reel-around-the-fountain-lyrics
Song Description: From The Smiths' eponymous first album. Reel Around the Fountain met with controversy, with some tabloid newspapers alleging the songs were suggestive of paedophilia, a claim strongly denied by the group.
Lyrics:

Release Date: February 20, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-pretty-girls-make-graves-lyrics
Song Description: Pretty Girls Make Graves is about Morrisseys view on sex expressed through an encounter with a lustful girl.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Morrissey]
Upon the sand, upon the bay
"There is a quick and easy way" you say
Before you illustrate
I'd rather state
I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am

[Chorus: Morrissey]
And sorrow's native son
He will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls make graves

[Verse 2: Morrissey]
End of the pier, end of the bay
You tug my arm, and say
"Give in to lust, give up to lust
Oh, heaven knows we'll soon be dust"
Oh, I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am

[Chorus: Morrissey & Annalisa Jablonka]

But nature played this trick on me
She wants it now

A smile lights up her stupid face, and well, it would

Title: Still Ill
Release Date: February 20, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-still-ill-lyrics
Song Description: Still Ill is a 1984 track by The Smiths, composed by lead singer Morrissey and guitarist Marr. The track premiered on the eponymous debut album The Smiths.

The song is primarily a lament about the passage of time (both in the context of individuals and of greater society) and a longing for a past that will never return.

As with many Smiths songs, some interpret the song as being being a reference to closet homosexuality.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I decree today that life
Is simply taking and not giving
England is mine, it owes me a living
But ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
Oh, ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
No, we cannot cling to those dreams
Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno

[Chorus]
Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill? Oh-oh-oh
Oh, am I still ill? Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno
Ask me why and I'll die
Oh, ask me why and I'll die
And if you must go to work tomorrow
Well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
For there are brighter sides to life
And I should know because I've seen them
But not very often

Title: Back to the Old House
Release Date: November 12, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-back-to-the-old-house-lyrics
Song Description: The narrator in this song is speaking metaphorically of the longing for things to return as they once were. In this case, the narrator wishes hed told the person in verse 2 that he had feelings for them, so he wonders idly whether theyd moved away, perhaps fantasizing of an instance in which he professes his feelings for them, though the line But I never will, is recognizing the fact that you cannot go back to the past no matter how much youd like for things to be different.

PROPOSED SUGGESTION: Alongside the obvious indications that the song is about dealing with ones past, it is also worth mentioning that the song may have been slightly motivated by the destruction of Morrisseys childhood home in Queens Park, the old house he quite literally will never return to.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I would rather not go
Back to the old house
I would rather not go
Back to the old house
There's too many bad memories
Too many memories there

[Refrain]
Oh, the house
The house

[Verse 2]
When you cycled by
Here began all my dreams
The saddest thing I've ever seen
And you never knew
How much I really liked you
Because I never even told you
Oh, and I meant to
Are you still there
Or have you moved away?
Or have you moved away?

Oh, have you?

Song Description: In 2003, Morrissey named They Boy With The Thorn In His Side to be his favourite Smiths song.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A murderous desire
For love

[Verse 1]
How can they look into my eyes
And still they don't believe me?
How can they hear me say those words
Still they don't believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever, they ever believe me?
Oh, ohh

[Chorus]
The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A plundering desire
For l-l-love

[Verse 2]
How can they see the love in our eyes
And still they don't believe us?
And after all this time
They don't want to believe us
And if they don't believe us now
Will they ever believe us?

Where do you go? Who do you need to know?

Title: What Difference Does It Make?
Release Date: January 16, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-what-difference-does-it-make-lyrics
Song Description: What Difference Does It Make? is the Smiths' third single in the UK, released on the 16th of January, 1984. The song peaked at #12 on the UK Singles Chart, being relevant in the bands early success. The song would then make it onto the bands self titled debut album, as the 9th track.

The song is about dismissal from a friend after they find out a secret about you. Although not confirmed, fans like to speculate that the song is based on a true story about Morrissey confessing his feelings to another man, only to be subsequently rejected.

What Difference Does It Make? is not one of Morrisseys favorites among the Smiths' catalogue, unfortunately, voicing his opinion to Following the Mozziah, explaining that What Difference Does It Make is musically interesting but lyrically it is verySimon Le Bon [of Duran Duran]. I find the lyrics facile and mildly embarrassing. Otherwise its a majestic pop melody by Johnny and, ironically, had the lyrics indeed been penned by Simon Le Bon, I would probably cover it! As it is Id feel too ashamed..
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
All men have secrets and here is mine
So let it be known
For we have been through hell and high tide
I think I can rely on you
And yet you start to recoil
Heavy words are so lightly thrown
But still I'd leap in front
Of a flying bullet for you

[Chorus]
So, what difference does it make?
So, what difference does it make?
It makes none, but now you have gone
And you must be looking very old tonight

[Verse 2]
The devil will find work
For idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
Because you asked me to
But now you make me feel so ashamed
Because I've only got two hands
But I'm still fond of you
Oh-oh-oh

For idle hands to do
I stole, and then I lied
Just because you asked me to
But now you know the truth about me
You won't see me anymore
Well, I'm still fond of you

[Chorus]
But no more apologies
No more, no more apologies
Oh, I'm too tired, I'm so sick and tired
And I'm feeling very sick and ill today

Lyrics:

Song Description: This song is about adolescence and a crush that Morrissey used to have during his teen years but never said anything to, which he is addressing here.

This song shows everything that makes Morrissey who he is as a songwriter. It has his charm, his fantastic wordplay and his wittiness.

A hidden gem amongst The Smiths discography.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent six years on your trail
Six long years on your trail
Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent six years on your trail
Six full years of my life on your trail

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life

[Chorus]
Sixteen, clumsy and shy
I went to London and I
I booked myself in at the Y.W.C.A
I said "I like it here, can I stay?
I like it here, can I stay?
Do you have a vacancy for a back-scrubber?"

She was left behind and sour
And she wrote to me equally dour

I just liked you more"

Title: The Headmaster Ritual
Release Date: February 11, 1985, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-the-headmaster-ritual-lyrics
Song Description: In 2011, Pitchfork writer Douglas Wolk wrote that Its safe to say that nobody else, before or since, has opened a significant rock album by hammering the bejesus out of the capoed, open-tuned chord that begins The Headmaster Ritual.

Like the Pink Floyd song Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2 from six years prior, The Headmaster Ritual is a commentary on the widespread use of corporal punishment in the British education system. Unlike Roger Waters approach to the subject, Morriseys matter-of-fact description of British schoolteachers as militant sadists drew controversy in the UK. According to Tony Fletchers 2013 band biography A Light That Never Goes Out: The Enduring Saga of the Smiths, the Manchester Education Authority were so outraged by the song that they threatened to get the Smiths banned from performing in their native Manchester, whose schools are singled out in the opening line.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Belligerent ghouls run Manchester schools
Spineless swines, cemented minds

Sir leads the troops, jealous of youth
Same old suit since 1962

I don't want to stay
Give up education

You should know time's tide will smother you
And I will too
When you laugh about people
Who feel so very lonely
Their only desire is to die
Well, I'm afraid it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh

[Chorus]
But that joke isn't funny anymore
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
More than you'll ever know

Title: William, It Was Really Nothing
Release Date: August 20, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-william-it-was-really-nothing-lyrics
Song Description: This song is about a love triangle between 2 men and a woman. Many believe its addressed to William Mackenzie, lead singer of the Associates. In 1993 Mackenzie wrote the song Stephen, Youre Really Something in response.

Another interpretation is that it is inspired by the 1963 film Billy Liar, one of Morrisseys favourites, in which the titular protagonist struggles with the mountain of lies he tells to his two fiances, among others, to get through his miserable life working class life in a humdrum town.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
The rain falls hard on a humdrum town
This town has dragged you down
Oh, the rain falls hard on a humdrum town
This town has dragged you down, no, no
And everybody's got to live their life
And God knows I've got to live mine
God knows I've got to live mine

[Chorus]
William, William, it was really nothing
William, William, it was really nothing
It was your life

[Verse 2]
How can you stay with a fat girl who'll say, oh
"Would you like to marry me?
And if you like you can buy the ring"?
She doesn't care about anything
"Would you like to marry me?
And if you like you can buy the ring"
I don't dream about anyone except myself

[Chorus]
Woah, William, William, it was really nothing

Title: Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me
Release Date: December 7, 1987, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-last-night-i-dreamt-that-somebody-loved-me-lyrics
Song Description: Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me is a slow-paced string-driven ballad about loneliness that drips emotion.

The crux of the song comes with the end of a relationship, how their love felt so real and close and now they have nothing. Thus, the relationship becomes essentially a fleeting dream in their mind. The song also bears stark lyrical and sonic similarities to their heartbreaking ode I Know Its Over.

I know its over, and it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Coal miner strikers yell

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt
That somebody loved me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm
Last night I felt
Real arms around me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm

[Verse 2]
So tell me how long
Before the last one
And tell me how long
Before the right one

But it goes on

Release Date: February 11, 1985, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-well-i-wonder-lyrics
Song Description: Well I Wonders narrator is gone, with no hope of return. The song isnt so much a cry for help as a futile, bleak, almost pathetic fading into a darkness with no light at the end of the tunnel.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Well, I wonder, do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry (Why?)
Well, I wonder, do you see me when we pass?
I half-die (Why?)

[Chorus]
Please, keep me in mind
Please, keep me in mind

Gasping, dying, but somehow still alive

Title: Suffer Little Children
Release Date: February 20, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-suffer-little-children-lyrics
Song Description: Suffer Little Children is the final track on The Smithss self-titled debut album. It is about the Moors murders, but only mentions one of the two murderers involved, namely Myra Hindley. The song was extremely controversial upon its initial release, as some people  including relatives of the murdered children  considered it to be exploitative of the tragedy. Many stores, including Woolworths, pulled both the Heaven Knows Im Miserable Now single (Suffer Little Children is its B-side) and the LP from their shelves. Morrissey later would establish a friendship with Ann West, the mother of victim Lesley Ann Downey, and she stated she felt the bands motives for recording the song were honorable.

The title likely refers to the biblical quote, Suffer little children to come unto me, which was apparently chanted at Hindley in jail.
Lyrics:

Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave and I'll lay me down
Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave and I'll lay me down
Lesley Anne and your pretty white beads
Oh, John, you'll never be a man
And you'll never see your home again
Oh, Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
Tonight will be your very last night
A woman said, "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his sacred head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes
Hindley wakes and says
"Oh, wherever he has gone, I have gone"
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death

Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes

"Oh, whatever he has done, I have done"

Title: A Rush and a Push and the Land Is Ours
Release Date: September 22, 1987, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-a-rush-and-a-push-and-the-land-is-ours-lyrics
Song Description: A Rush and a Push and the Land is Ours opens the album with a dreamlike sequence followed by an otherworldly thumping beat.

A unique feature of the song is that it is one of the only Smiths' songs which solely uses keyboards rather than guitar, highlighting its throwback sound and somewhat haunting element.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Hello
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
Hung by his pretty white neck
Some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
But I missed my bed
So I soon came home

[Verse]
They said, "There's too much caffeine in your bloodstream
And a lack of real spice in your life"
I said, "Leave me alone because I'm alright, dad
Just surprised to still be on my own..."

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the strain of the pain again

[Chorus]
A rush and a push and the land that we stand on is ours
It has been before, so it shall be again
And people who are uglier than you and I
They take what they need and just leave

Title: Meat Is Murder
Release Date: February 11, 1985, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-meat-is-murder-lyrics
Song Description: Meat Is Murder, with its simulated bovine cries and buzz-saw guitars, took vegetarianism to a new height in popular media. At the time when this song was recorded, animal welfare werent as mainstream of an issue as they are now.

The consumption of meat, especially mass-produced factory-farmed meat, is inherently related to the suffering of animals, and the whole point of this song is to make us think about this unpleasant truth. Its not really the kind of song you just sit back and enjoy.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
*sawing machines and cow groans*

[Verse 1]
Heifer whines could be human cries
Closer comes the screaming knife
This beautiful creature must die
This beautiful creature must die
A death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the flesh you so fancifully fry
Is not succulent, tasty or kind
It's death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the calf that you carve with a smile
It is murder
And the turkey you festively slice
It is murder
Do you know how animals die?

[Verse 2]
Kitchen aromas aren't very homely
It's not comforting, cheery or kind
It's sizzling blood
And the unholy stench of murder
It's not natural, normal or kind
The flesh you so fancifully fry
The meat in your mouth
As you savour the flavour of murder
No, no, no, it is murder
No, no, no, it is murder
Oh, and who hears when animals cry?

Title: You’ve Got Everything Now
Release Date: February 20, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-youve-got-everything-now-lyrics
Song Description: Morrissey expresses his bitterness towards a person whom he implies is only faking his happiness, because Morrissey believes that having a casual life isnt enough.

Morrissey changed the lyrics of this song very often in live performances to: As merry as the days were long, Im right and youre wrong.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRIwSvQrbmg
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
Back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose

But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life

[Chorus]
No, I've never had a job
Because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
But I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
But I don't want a lover

Title: Never Had No One Ever
Release Date: June 16, 1986, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-never-had-no-one-ever-lyrics
Song Description: Never Had No One Ever is the Smiths at their bleakest  like listening to the birth of a depression. Morrissey writes about having the nagging feeling of being an outsider his whole childhood in Manchester, and the troubles that come which bled into young adulthood.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
When you walk without ease
On these streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
It lasted twenty years, seven months
And twenty-seven days, and I know

[Chorus]
I know that I never, ever, oh, weh, woah
Had no one ever

Now I'm outside your house, I'm alone
And I'm outside your house
I hate to intrude, oh, alone, I'm alone
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone

Title: Handsome Devil (John Peel Session 18/05/83)
Release Date: November 12, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-handsome-devil-john-peel-session-18-05-83-lyrics
Song Description: Handsome Devil appears on the November 1984 compilation album Hatful Of Hollow, having been recorded originally during the John Peel session at the BBC, May 31, 1983.

The lyrics caused quite a controversy, albeit of the manufactured kind, from conservative mediamost especially from MP Geoffrey Dickens. Dickens was a controversial figure whose crusade against child pornography went too far, making allegations about Satanic ritual abuse (indeed he was one of those responsible for the Satanic panic of the 1980s). Thus, it was no surprise that Dickens would also claim this song was about pedophilia, especially after the controversy of Reel Around The Fountain.

The September 3, 1983, issue of New Musical Express lead to Morrissey delivering the following in response: This piece makes me out to be a proud child-molester and I dont even like children. Handsome Devil is entirely directed towards adults.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
All the streets are crammed with things eager to be held
I know what hands are for, and I'd like to help myself
You ask me the time, but I sense something more
And I would like to give you what I think you're asking for

[Pre-Chorus]
You handsome devil
Oh, you handsome devil

[Chorus]
Let me get my hands
On your mammary glands
And let me get your head
On the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say

[Verse 2]
I crack the whip and you skip
But you deserve it, you deserve it, deserve it, deserve it
A boy in the bush is worth two in the hand
I think I can help you get through your exams

Title: Girlfriend in a Coma
Release Date: August 10, 1987, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-girlfriend-in-a-coma-lyrics
Song Description: An instance when Johnny Marrs music and Morrisseys lyrics' trademark incongruity (see Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others) works, with Marr adding a strangely cheery backing to a rather dark song, creating comically ironic contrast  the definition of juxtaposition.
Lyrics:

I know, it's serious

When I could have "murdered" her

Song Description: Stop Me If You Think Youve Heard This One Before was released as the fourth and last single off of Strangeways, Here We Come. It was also the last single to ever be released by the Smiths.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Stop me, oh-oho, stop me

Stop me, oh-oho, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
Only slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love

[Verse 1]
I was delayed, I was waylaid
An emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough to make
A shy, bald, Buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder
Who said I'd lied to her?
Oh, who said I'd lied because I never? I never!
Who said I'd lied because I never?

[Verse 2]
I was detained, I was restrained
And broke my spleen
And broke my knee
And then he really laced into me
Friday night in Out-patients
Who said I'd lied to her?
Oh, who said I'd lied? Because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied? Because I never
And so I drank one
It became four
And when I fell on the floor I drank more

Title: Barbarism Begins at Home
Release Date: April 10, 1985, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-barbarism-begins-at-home-lyrics
Song Description: The brilliantly titled Barbarism Begins at Home, during which Morrissey yelps as if in pain, is also about children being hit  a crack on the head is what you get for asking. Violence or the implied threat thereof is an integral component of Smiths songs, from In a river the color of lead/immerse the babys head in This Night Has Opened My Eyes to the angry mob that opens Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me.

The song shares a chord progression and underlying rhythm with the S.O.S. Bands 1980 funk/disco hit Take Your Time (Do It Right). Guitarist Johnny Marr and bassist Andy Rourke had played in a funk band named Freak Party prior to Marr and Morrissey starting the Smiths, and likely would have known Take Your Time very well (although it missed the Top 40 in the UK). It is not known whether the owners of the composition copyrights to Take Your Time (Do It Right) have ever filed an infringement claim against Marr and Morrissey for Barbarism.
Lyrics:

Title: I Don’t Owe You Anything
Release Date: February 20, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-i-dont-owe-you-anything-lyrics
Song Description: I Dont Owe You Anything tells the story of a person trying to charm someone over Johnny Marrs smooth groove.

As stated in the book Mozipedia  The Encyclopedia of Morrissey and The Smiths, in 2005, Morrissey said that this was one of the few songs hed written which now made him shudder and, to date, is the only Smiths song hes officially disowned. Likely because the lyrics contain a controversial attitude of being owed something by a lover.
Lyrics:

Title: Vicar in a Tutu
Release Date: June 16, 1986, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-vicar-in-a-tutu-lyrics
Song Description: This track is perhaps not the high watermark of the record or be deemed as The Smiths finest hour however its an enjoyable fun track where we get to see Morrisseys more light-hearted side somewhat more than on any other track on the record. It pokes fun at religionwhich Morrissey has always been antias well as celebrating individuality in the face of religious conformities.

Notably, the song also projects allyship with gender non-conformists, rejecting the othering and disapproval of cross-dressing individuals.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I was minding my business
Lifting some lead off
The roof of the Holy Name church
It was worthwhile living a laughable life
To set my eyes on the blistering sight

[Chorus]
Of a Vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way

[Verse 2]
A scanty bit of a thing
With a decorative ring
That wouldn't cover the head of a goose
As Rose collects the money in a canister
Who comes sliding down the bannister?

[Chorus]
A vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way

[Verse 3]
The monkish monsignor
With a head full of plaster
Said "My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
As Rose counts the money in the canister
As natural as rain
He dances again

Lyrics:

Please don't cry
For the ghost and the storm outside

Nor infiltrate your mind
My life down I shall lie
If the bogey man should try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
To tease, torment, and tantalize

Wavering shadows loom
A piano plays in an empty room
There'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
And when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
For you are all that matters
And I'll love you till the day I die
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
Ceiling shadows shimmy by
And when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
There's sadness in your beautiful eyes
Oh, your untouched, unsoiled, wondrous eyes
My life down I shall lie
Should restless spirits try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
I once had a child, and it saved my life
And I never even asked his name
I just looked into his wondrous eyes
And said, "Never, never, never again"

Just like a moth to a flame
So rattle my bones all over the stones
I'm only a beggar man whom nobody owns
Oh, see how words as old as sin
Fit me like a glove

Together we lie, together we pray
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine, mine
Climb up on my knee, sonny boy
Although you're only three, sonny boy

Title: Nowhere Fast
Release Date: February 11, 1985, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-nowhere-fast-lyrics
Song Description: Nowhere Fast shows Meat Is Murder from its funny side as Morrissey croons:

Id like to drop my trousers to the Queen

Its hard to hear the song without wondering if Morrissey is already, on only his second album, parodying himself.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means, of slender means
Each household appliance
Is like a new science in m-my town

[Chorus]
And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
And when a train goes by, it's such a sad sound
(La-ha, da-da, da-deem-da-da, duh-widdle-da-da-dum)
It's such a sad thing

[Verse 2]
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
Every sensible child will know what this means
The poor and the needy
Are selfish and greedy on her terms

[Chorus]
And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
And when a train goes by, it's such a sad sound
(La-ha, da-da, da-diddle-wa-da-da, duh-widdle-da-da-dum)
It's such a sad thing

And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life and I think about death
And neither one
Particularly appeals to me

In the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die, woah, woah10Embed

Title: Girl Afraid
Release Date: November 12, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-girl-afraid-lyrics
Song Description: On Girl Afraid Morrisey plays with the word girlfriend as girl afraid and boyfriend as boy afraid. The song deals with mistaken assumptions in the relationship of said girl and boy.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Girl afraid
Where do his intentions lay?
Or does he even have any?

[Refrain]
She says
"He never really looks at me
I give him every opportunity
In the room downstairs he sat and stared
In the room downstairs he sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again"

[Break]
("I'll never make that mistake again")
("I'll never make that mistake again")

[Verse 2]
Boy afraid
Prudence never pays
And everything she wants costs money

[Refrain]
"But she doesn't even like me
And I know because she said so
In the room downstairs she sat and stared
In the room downstairs she sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again, no"You might also like2Embed

Title: Rusholme Ruffians
Release Date: February 11, 1985, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-rusholme-ruffians-lyrics
Song Description: Rusholme Ruffians, with Johnny Marrs rockabilly riff, is about Manchester and makes the city (home of much of the history of British feminism, socialism, vegetarianism and the Guardian) sound exciting, a place where things happen. Who wouldnt want to be ruffian from Rusholme?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
The last night of the fair
By the big wheel generator
A boy is stabbed and his money is grabbed
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
She is famous, she is funny
An engagement ring doesn't mean a thing
To a mind consumed by brass money

[Chorus]
And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout

[Verse 2]
The last night of the fair
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait on her mother's side
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait on her mother's side

[Chorus]
And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone

And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout

[Verse 4]
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said, "How quickly would I die
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la)

With a fountain pen

Title: Rubber Ring
Release Date: 1985, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-rubber-ring-lyrics
Song Description: Well respected by Smiths fans and critics alike, Rubber Ring is a song about coming of age, and leaving the awkward, difficult period in life that is being a teenager.

Morrissey urges the listener to never forget those songs that kept you going through tough times, even though now you may have matured and their effect or your admiration for them may have lessened.

Coupled with a funky, minstrel-esque guitar piece by Marr and interludes of interviews claiming everybodys clever nowadays (a commentary on the ever growing number of pseudo-intellectuals), the surrounding sound effects really reaffirm Rubber Ring as a piece deeply entrenched and admired within the expansive and eclectic back catalogue of the Smiths.

The title is both a nod to a vinyl record (as it is round and made of rubber) and the life preserver rubber ring that is tossed into  water to save people from drowning. To many teenagers, songs by The Smiths are their Rubber Rings. This music helps them get through tough times in their life.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
A sad fact widely known
The most impassionate song to a lonely soul
Is so easily outgrown
But don't forget the songs that made you smile
And the songs that made you cry
When you lay in awe on the bedroom floor
And said, "Oh, oh, smother me mother"
Oh, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh na na na, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh la day, la da da dey di la da da dey di

[Verse 2]
The passing of time and all of its crimes
Is making me sad again
The passing of time and all of its sickening crimes
Is making me sad again
But don't forget the songs that made you cry
And the songs that saved your life
Yes, you're older now and you're a clever swine
But they were the only ones who ever stood by you

[Verse 3]
The passing of time leaves empty lives waiting to be filled
The passing of time leaves empty lives waiting to be filled
I'm here with the cause, I'm holding the torch
In the corner of your room (Can you hear me?)
And when you're dancing and laughing and finally living
Hear my voice in your head and think of me kindly
Oh, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh na na na, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh la day, la da da dey di, la da da dey di

Title: I Won’t Share You
Release Date: September 28, 1987, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-i-wont-share-you-lyrics
Song Description: On I Wont Share You Morrissey lets his inner egoist show, shamelessly breaking up with his lover whom he sees as burden. The lover can be interpreted as Smiths' guitarist Johnny Marr.

It is the final song on the final The Smiths LP.
Lyrics:

[Chorus 1]
I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive
And ambition
The zeal I feel
This is my time

Or is life sick and cruel, instead?"
"Yes!"

Title: Miserable Lie
Release Date: February 20, 1984, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-miserable-lie-lyrics
Song Description: Miserable Lie tells the story of a naive country boy corrupted by the lustful ways of a prostitute. A quintessential Smiths track.

It is especially notable for its odd song structure, which doesnt quite follow any standard conventions and kicks into a falsetto double-time halfway through.
Lyrics:

So, goodbye
Please stay with your own kind
And I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
It's not time, it's not time
So, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I know I need hardly say
How much I love your casual way
Oh, but please put your tongue away
A little higher and we're well away
The dark nights are drawing in
And your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
And love is just a miserable lie
You have destroyed my flower-like life
Not once, twice
You have corrupt my innocent mind
Not once, twice
I know the wind-swept mystical air
It means I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
It means I'd like to seize your underwear
What do we get for our trouble and pain?
Just a rented room in Whalley Range
What do we get for our trouble and pain?
Whalley Range
Into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her

Title: I Started Something I Couldn’t Finish
Release Date: September 22, 1987, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-i-started-something-i-couldnt-finish-lyrics
Song Description: Perhaps not the most obvious choice for a single, I Started Something I Couldnt Finish was the second of four singles from Strangeways, Here We Come.

It was released in October 1987, after The Smiths had officially disbanded. With its prominent saxophone and unrelenting drum beat, the song sees Morrissey and company swinging with an abandon that more than casually suggests a lack of focus.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
The lanes were silent
There was nothing, no one, nothing around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
With a hard-faced three-word gesture

[Chorus]
I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something and now I'm not too sure

[Verse 2]
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Oh, that's what tradition means
And I doused another venture
With a gesture that was absolutely vile

[Chorus]
I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me, typical me

My only weakness is— well, never mind, never mind, oh

Title: These Things Take Time
Release Date: June 26, 1983, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-these-things-take-time-lyrics
Song Description: These Things Take Time is another upbeat Smiths' song with an homoerotic sexual undertone. It was originally released as a B-side to the maxi single version of What Difference Does It Make?

In a 2015 Reddit AMA interview, Noel Gallagher has named this track as one of his favourite the Smiths songs.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wunderkind
You took me behind a disused railway line
And said, "I know a place where we can go
Where we are not known"
And then you gave me something that I won't forget too soon

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't believe that you'd ever care
And this is why you will never care

[Chorus]
But these things take time
And I know that I'm
The most inept that ever stepped

[Verse 2]
I'm spellbound, but a woman divides
And the hills are alive with celibate cries
But you know where you came from
You know where you're going
And you know where you belong
You said I was ill and you were not wrong

Title: What She Said
Release Date: February 11, 1985, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-what-she-said-lyrics
Song Description: What She Said is told from a female perspective  its rare for male songwriters to write about women with empathy rather than desire  and how it taps into a certain kind of teenage girls fantasies.

Accompanying is a tune where Morrissey beats a path to your head, but its Johnny Marrs melodies that carry the words to your heart.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
What she said
"How come someone hasn't noticed that I'm dead
And decided to bury me? God knows, I'm ready!"
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
What she said was sad
But then, all the rejection she's had
To pretend to be happy could only be idiocy
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
But what she said
Was not for the job or lover that she never had
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
No, no, no

What she read
All heady books she'd sit and prophesise
It took a tattooed boy from Birkenhead
To really really open her eyes

Title: Paint a Vulgar Picture
Release Date: September 28, 1987, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-paint-a-vulgar-picture-lyrics
Song Description: A dense song about Morrisseys feelings towards the music industry, exemplified by tragedy  the death of a star, failing, or otherwise.
The lyrics takes the viewpoint of two different narrators, some omniscient insider, and a fan of the deceased. Through them, it is analyzed how a persons legacy is a (cruelly) amorphous and malleable thing, and how music itself (an individuals whole life work!) can be a source of intimate emotional connection, or simple profit.

Ironically one of the major topics that Morrissey brings up, is repackaging old material and selling it off to make more money off the innocent fan. The Smiths became renowned for doing this after releasing five greatest hits albums and two boxsets after their split-up.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
At the record company meeting
On their hands, a dead star
And, oh, the plans they weave
And, oh, the sickening greed

[Verse 2]
At the record company party
On their hands, a dead star
The sycophantic slags all say
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue, re-package, re-package
Re-evaluate the songs
Double pack with a photograph
Extra track and a tacky badge

[Verse 3]
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them, please them"
Sadly, this was your life
But you could have said no if you'd wanted to
You could have said no if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them, please them"
Sadly, this was your life
But you could have said no if you'd wanted to
You could have walked away, couldn't you?

Who could never begin to know
Who could never really know

Best of, most of, satiate the need
Slip them into different sleeves
Buy both, and feel deceived
Climber, new entry, re-entry

"Please the Press in Belgium!"
This was your life
And when it fails to recoup? Well, maybe
You just haven't earned it yet, baby

[Verse 6]
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
You're just the same as I am
What makes most people feel happy
Leads us headlong into harm
So, in my bedroom in those "ugly new houses"
I danced my legs down to the knees
But me and my "true love"
We will never meet again
[Verse 7]
At the record company meeting
On their hands, at last, a dead star
But they can never taint you in my eyes
They can never touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you, my darling
They cannot touch you now
But me and my "true love"
Will never meet again, uh

Song Description: Morrissey is effective in Death of a Disco Dancer, which pinpoints Johnny Marrs importance to the band, as it builds from his scraping-fingernail fret work to a cacophony of guitars, keyboards and thunderous fury of the percussion.
Lyrics:

The death of a disco dancer
Well, it happens a lot 'round here
And if you think peace is a common goal
That goes to show how little you know

And some may say
When usually it's nothing
Surely you're happy
It should be this way?

[Verse 1]
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
And "May the lines sag, may the lines sag heavy and deep tonight"

[Chorus]
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Cause you're evil

Title: Sweet and Tender Hooligan
Release Date: 1987, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-sweet-and-tender-hooligan-lyrics
Song Description: Morrissey uses sarcasm and satire to ridicule the justice system in the way of how it forgives the young sweet and tender hooligans. In the song hes playing a role of a satirical defense to the person, who has committed all of the crimes and he mockingly tries to justify the murders.

The song was recorded for a BBC John Peel session in December 1986 and released in April 1987 as a b-side to Sheila Take a Bow, appearing on the US compilation Louder than Bombs later that year.

In 1995 Sweet and Tender Hooligan was released as a standalone single in the US to promote their Singles compilation. The cover features a still of boxer Cornelius Carr, taken from the music video for Morrisseys 1995 singles Boxers.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
And he said that he'd never, never do it again
And of course he won't
Oh, not until the next time
He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
And he swore that he'll never, never do it again
And of course he won't
Oh, not until the next time

[Verse 1]
Poor old man, he had an accident
With a three-bar fire
But that's okay
Because he wasn't very happy anyway
Poor woman
Strangled in her very own bed as she read
But that's okay, because she was old
And she would have died anyway

[Chorus]
Don't blame the sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never, never, never
Never, never do it again

Lyrics:

[Verse]
On the high-rise estate
What's at the back of your mind?
On a three day debate, on a high-rise estate
But what's at the back of your mind?
Two icy-cold hands conducting the way
It's the Eskimo blood in my veins
Amid concrete and clay and general decay
Nature must still find a way
So, ignore all the codes of the day
Let your juvenile impulses sway
This way and that way, and this way and that way
God, how sex implores you
To let yourself lose yourself

[Chorus]
Stretch out and wait, stretch out and wait
Let your puny body lie down, lie down
As we lie, you say
As we lie, you say
Stretch out and
Stretch out and wait, stretch out and wait
Let your puny body lie down, lie down

[Bridge]
As we lie, you say
"Will the world end in the night time?"
I really don't know
"Or will the world end in the day time?"
I really don't know
"And is there any point ever having children?"
Oh, I don't know
All I do know is we're here and it's now

So, stretch out and wait, stretch out and wait
There is no debate, no debate, no debate
How can you consciously contemplate
When there's no debate, no debate?

Title: Shakespeare’s Sister
Release Date: 1987, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-shakespeares-sister-lyrics
Song Description: Shakespeares Sister was released as a single in March 1985, and later appeared on the Louder Than Bombs compilation.

The title comes from Virginia Woolfs essay A Room of Ones Own, where she imagines a fictional sister of Shakespeare called Judith, who  despite being as intelligent as her brother  would have no chance of getting the same education or recognition:

It would have been impossible, completely and entirely, for any woman to have written the plays of Shakespeare in the age of Shakespeare.

The songs title in turn inspired the 90s pop rock duo Shakespears Sister.

The AV Club did a write-up of the song for a Hear This feature.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Young bones groan and the rocks below say
"Throw your skinny body down, son"
But I'm going to meet the one I love
So, please don't stand in my way
Because I'm going to meet the one I love
No, Mamma, let me go

[Verse 2]
Young bones groan and the rocks below say
"Throw your white body down"
But I'm going to meet the one I love
At last, at last, at last
I'm going to meet the one I love, la-de-da, la-de-da
No, Mamma, let me go

[Verse 3]
I thought that if you had an acoustic guitar
Then it meant that you were a protest singer
Oh, I can smile about it now but at the time, it was terrible
No, Mamma, let me go

Every day you must say
So how do I feel about my life
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes

How dearly I'd love to get carried away

And time is against me now

Oh, who and what to blame?
Oh, anything is hard to find

Song Description: You Just Havent Earned It Yet sees Morrissey telling the listener why they dont have the life they wanted. They simply just havent earned it yet. This is one of my favorite The Smiths songs due to Morrissey singing very rhythmically.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
If you're wondering why
All the love that you long for eludes you
And people are rude and cruel to you

You just haven't earned it yet, baby

When all I wanted from life was to be famous
I have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong

Title: London
Release Date: January 26, 1987, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-london-lyrics
Song Description: In this song Morrissey speaks out directly to a man who decided to catch a train to London to pursue a better life, continuously speaking to his own feelings and asking him if he is sure of the very important decision he is making.

It is one of the few lyrics where Morrissey doesnt speak in the first person.

London was released in 1987 as a B-Side to Shoplifters of the World Unite. It was also included in the bands second compilation album, Louder Than Bombs, released in 1987.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Smoke lingers 'round your fingers
Train, heave on to Euston

[Chorus]
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
Ohh

[Verse 2]
You've left your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But did you see the jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?

[Chorus]
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

[Verse 3]
You've left your girlfriend on the platform
With this really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows that "When he goes, he really goes"

[Chorus]
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?You might also like4Embed

[Chorus: Kirsty MacColl]
Golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh, my darling
Why did you change?

[Verse 1: Morrissey]
Boy in a million, idol, a big star
I didn't tell you how great you were
I didn't grovel and scream and rip
Your brand new jacket at the seams
You made a record, they liked your singing
All of a sudden the phone stops ringing
Ah, I never thought that you would let
The glory make you forget

[Chorus: Kirsty MacColl]
Golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh, my darling
Why did you change?

Who do you turn to when you're backstage?

Johnny Marr hated the song so much that it was one of the reasons he left the band. Marr recalled to Record Collector magazine in 1992:

Work Is A Four Letter Word I hated. That was the last straw, really. I didnt form a group to perform Cilla Black songs. That was it, really. I made a decision that I was going to get away on holiday. The only place I could think of was L.A. L.A. was the only place I knew where thered be sunshine, so off I went. I never saw Morrissey again.

And if a doublе-decker bus crashes into us
To diе by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

[Verse 2]
Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought "Oh God, my chance has come at last"
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see life
Driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home
Because I haven't got one, la-di-dum, oh, I haven't got one
Oh, oh

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexities
When the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"

[Chorus]
A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the rings"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about thеse things

[Verse 2]
I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruеsome that someone so handsome should care"

Lyrics:

What would you sell?
Loose glasses and suit
Heart and soul
Won't wear out

That's not enough!
I wonder what's inside
Fish fillet knife
Can cut
Right through my eye...

I'm looking for some words
To call my own
Worn-out phrases
And a hand-me-down

They'll knock me
Under where I stand
Sad on his back
In a corned beef pan

I'm Going under
You can feel them pulling me down
To the rust inside

This is the way
Franken-star is born

Others have worn
All held together by a management glue
Too much glue
Watch the stars turn blue
Turn blue
Turn blue
Turn blue

I'm going under
You can feel them pulling me down
To the halls of rust
Eeh...

I, I, I, I, I...

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wunderkind
You took me behind a disused railway line
And said, "I know a place where we can go
Where we are not known"

And the hills arе alive with celibate cries
But you know where you came from
You know where you're going

Very old friend
Came by today
As he was telling everyone in town
Of all the love that he'd just found

Talked and talked
And I heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
Prettiest green eyes anywhere

The last night of the fair
By the big wheel generator

An engagement ring doesn't mean a thing
To a mind consumed by brass and money, ah

Title: This Charming Man (London)
Release Date: October 31, 1983, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-this-charming-man-london-lyrics
Song Description: This Charming Man (London) was the initial studio recording of This Charming Man, recorded in Matrix Studios, London (in contrast with the final version, which was subsequently recorded in Strawberry Studios, Stockport). It was originally found only as an alternative A-side for the 12-inch version of the single, but was later featured within the 1992 single re-releases which compiled various versions of the song.

The track contains a sharp layer of reverb (most present on the famous Ah shout in the chorus) and vocal dominance; the guitar is tinnier and theres a surprisingly low mix on the bass. Much of the parts that made the final version of the track stand out are not quite as clear in this mix, so it becomes apparent why they might have been dissatisfied with this version.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car, this charming man

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Hello!

[Verse 1]
Farewell to these marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between archers
Her very Lowness with a head in a sling
I'm truly sorry, it sounds like a wonderful thing
I said "Charles, don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the daily mail
Dressed in your mother's bridal veil?"

[Verse 2]
And so, I checked all the registered historical facts
I was shocked and shamed to discover
I am the 18th pale descendant
Of some old queen or other
Oh, has the world changed, or have I changed?
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Some 9-year-old tough who peddles drugs, I swear to god
I never even knew what drugs were

[Verse 3]
So, I broke into the palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said "I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said "That's nothing, you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you're tied to your mother's apron
No one talks about ca—

Past the pub who breaks your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Past the pub who wrecks your body
And the church, all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
You can trust me, boys

[Outro]
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonelyEmbed

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking when I said

Lyrics:

[Intro]
(Oh)

[Verse 1]
I decree today that life
Is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
But ask me why and I'll spit in your eye, oh
Oh, ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
No, we cannot cling to those dreams

[Refrain]
Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I don't know

[Chorus]
Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh am I still ill?
Oh, no
Oh, no

Ask me why and I'll die
Oh ask me why and I'll die
And if you must go to work tomorrow
Well, if I were you I really wouldn't bother
For there are brighter sides to life
And I should know because I've seen them
Oh, but not often

[Chorus]
Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Oh, no, oh, no!
Oh, am I still ill?
Oh, no, oh, no!

I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar

You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?

So you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own
And you go home and you cry and you want to die
When you say "it's gonna happen now"
Wеll, when exactly do you mean?
See I'vе already waited too long
And all my hope is gone

You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved

Title: I Want a Boy for My Birthday
Release Date: January 1, 1982, URL: https://genius.com/The-smiths-i-want-a-boy-for-my-birthday-lyrics
Song Description: Recorded in Johnnys attic bedroom on a TEAC three track cassette recorder, in August 1982.
The Home demo was given to The Smiths then Bassist Dale Hibbert, so that he could familiarise himself with the track before The Smiths debut gig @ The Ritz, Manchester (October 4 1982).

The Smiths Cookies cover was discussed by journalist Simon Goddard in his 2013 book Songs That Saved Your Life (Revised Edition): The Art of The Smiths 1982-87. He wrote,
The earliest known surviving document in the recording history of The Smiths stems from those very first attic practice sessions with Morrissey, Marr, and Hibbert. It was for the latters benefit that the singer and guitarist taped a simple arrangement of I Want A Boy For My Birthday, a 1963 B-side by New York girl group The Cookies, on Marrs TEAC machine so that Hibbert could learn the melody in preparation for The Smiths first demo session. The cover was Morrisseys idea. Id never heard it before, says Marr, but I thought, Great, thisll really freak em out! I was really happy to encourage it.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said

[Chorus]
I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over

[Verse 2]
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me
The knife wants to cut me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though she needs you more than she loves you

[Chorus]
And I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over it's over it's over it's over
Over and over
I know it's over, and it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me and said

"If you're so funny
Then why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very entertaining
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very good-looking
Why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know, 'cause tonight, it's just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
Your triumphs and your charms
While they are in each other's arms"

[Chorus]
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
Over, over, over, over, over
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
Over, over
Love is natural and real
But not for you, my love
Not tonight, my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I
My love

Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head, ohh
Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head, ohh
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Morrissey]
Upon the sand, upon the bay
"There is a quick and easy way" you say
Before you illustrate
I'd rather state
I’m not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am

[Chorus: Morrissey]
And sorrow's native son
He will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls make graves

[Post-Chorus: Morrissey]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Morrissey]
End of the pier, end of the bay
You tug my arm, and say
"Give in to lust, give up to lust
Oh heaven knows we’ll soon be dust"
Oh, I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am

And sorrow's native son
He will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves

Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3: Morrissey]
I could have been wild and I could have been free
But nature played this trick on me
She wants it now
And she will not wait
But she's too rough
And I'm too delicate
Then, on the sand
Another man, he takes her hand
A smile lights up her stupid face
And well, it would
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith
[Post-Chorus: Morrissey]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

[Verse 1]
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives, where are they now?
With loves and hates and passions just like mine
They were born, and then they lived, and then they died
It seems so unfair, and I want to cry
You say: "'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn"
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times, maybe less, maybe more

[Verse 2]
If you must write prose and poems the words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take "on loan"
'Cause there's always someone, somewhere with a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs when you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall
You say: "'Long done do does did"
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text from whence was ripped
Some dizzy whore, 1804
You might also like[Chorus]
A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side, but you lose
'Cause whale blubber Wilde is on mine
Sugar!Embed
