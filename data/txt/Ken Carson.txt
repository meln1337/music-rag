Artist: Ken Carson, Alternate Names: Boy Barbie, Lil (N)ine, X Man, Teen X, Kenyatta Lee Frazier, Kenyatta Frazier, Kenyatta Frazier Jr.
Artist Description: Kenyatta Lee Frazier Jr. (born April 11, 2000), professionally known as Ken Carson (previously stylized as Ken Car$on), is an American recording artist and record producer from Atlanta, Georgia.

In an interview with Our Generation Music, Ken Carson explained on how he got the stage name, stating:

Ken Carson came from the name, Ken, the Barbie doll. Ken Carson, Barbie boyfriend. He just got a hard lifestyle. I just wanna live like him. He living life. I'ma live better than him.

Ken met the record producer (and his uncle) TM88 in 2015 and signed to 808 Mafia as a rapper. He would then begin to release music on SoundCloud as early as 2016. After gaining attention in the underground rap scene, in 2019, he signed to Opium: the label founded by Playboi Carti.

After signing to Opium, Ken would go on to release his first two EPs in 2020: Boy Barbie and Teen X. The latter featured Ken Carson’s breakout single, “Yale.”

Ken began 2021 by releasing the first Lost Files compilation on SoundCloud and releasing his third EP, Teen X : Relapsed, a deluxe version of Teen X, which featured the standout song “High as Sh!T.”

After catching early success online, Ken released his debut studio album, Project X, on July 23, 2021. Project X became a major success, as songs such as “Rock N Roll” and “Change” started to gain attention through social media. Thanks to this, Ken Carson landed a deal with Interscope Records in 2022.

Kicking off 2022 after signing to Interscope, Ken released the third installment of Lost Files through SoundCloud, with features ranging from Lil Tecca and labelmate Destroy Lonely. Ken’s sophomore album, X, was then released on July 8, 2022. Like with Project X, X also became a major success, with songs such as “MDMA,” “Murda Musik,” and “Freestyle 2” would gain internet sensation. The deluxe version of the album, XTENDED, would then be released on October 31, 2022.

Entering into 2023, Ken would initially release the fourth installment of Lost Files (originally titled lost ?) on SoundCloud, hosted by Ian Connor’s Born From Pain Sickö, only to be taken down a couple days later after hinting it’s disapproval of its release. On Valentine’s Day, Ken would later release “i need u,” to which it gained attention through social media after a snippet of the song was posted where it gained notoriety for its fast-paced audio.

Throughout March and June 2023, Ken would post a wide variety of snippets of unreleased songs, as well as producing for other artists, most notably for Lil Uzi Vert, in which he landed a production placement on Uzi’s third studio album, Pink Tape.

Ken’s third studio album, A Great Chaos, was originally supposed to be released on July 17, 2023, containing features from Destroy Lonely, as well as collaborating with Lil Uzi Vert following his production placement on “x2” on Pink Tape, however due to label issues the album was delayed. After much anticipated waiting, A Great Chaos would be announced for pre-save; confirming the October 13 release and would reveal the cover art, although the album would be leaked four days before its release.

After a half a year hiatus, in April 2024, Ken would return with the highly anticipated single, “Overseas,” and prepare for the anticipated release of More Chaos. Surprisingly though, he would rather release a deluxe version of A Great Chaos nearly three months later on July 5.

Title: Green Room
Release Date: October 13, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Ken-carson-green-room-lyrics
Song Description: Green Room is the introduction of Ken Carsons third studio album, A Great Chaos. Its title derives from the room, close to the stage, where artists are located prior to performing a set. For Ken, this may symbolize his sudden rise to fame, as he became one of the most prominent new-wave rappers over the span of two years.

On this track, Ken reflects on his journey in music, setting the stage for the rest of his rage-centered A Great Chaos. This opposes his previous album, X, which wrapped up with introspection similar to Green Room on The End.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
(Wake up, F1LTHY)
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh

[Chorus]
And this shit don't make no sense
How I went from broke to rich?
How the fuck you want me now, back then act like you ain't notice me? (Notice me, notice me)

Now my pockets filled with cash
Bitch I walk around with them blues, yeah
Lil' bitch, I walk around with them blues now
Yeah

[Verse]
You know how I rock, cut off stacks, keep kush in my pocket
They treat my swag just like a door the way these niggas knock it
Bitch, I'm in that mode like Naruto, I'm a nine-tailed fox
I don't want that ho if she ain't bringin' nothin' to the table but her box
I been gettin' tired of fuckin'
And I'm tired of being tired, shit, fuck it
Everyday I ball out, I make sure I get a bucket
How the fuck you don't know my middle name but you claim that you love me?
You don't love me (Love me, love me)
I know you don't love me
If a bitch try me, it's gon' get real ugly
If she wanna leave, I'll let her leave 'cause she already fucked me, huh
I'm such an asshole
Money over everything, these niggas gon' fold before my cash fold
Every time I post on Instagram, I make her mad, oh
Every time I pop out, you know I'm with a new bad ho, woah
And you can't relate 'cause what I been doin' lately feels so unreal
And I get depressed when I notice nobody feel how I feel (How I feel, how I feel, how I feel)
Yeah, I was wit' the Look Killa tryna catch a kill
I remember way, way back in the day, we couldn't even afford no meal
What I spent on purple drank, I could've paid his bills off for a year
I was Uberin' everywhere, now it's two-twenty on my dash when I steer
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
Half of these niggas ain't never seen shit, and these bitches ain't seen shit neither
When she workout, she rockin' a track suit, it's Balenciaga Adidas
And they say love can never ever be forever, so I'm takin' advantage of the moment
Bitch, I'm at the top, ain't got no opps, ain't got no opponents
When you at the top, ain't nobody there, it get real, real lonely
Everybody say this ho ain't goin', huh, wait 'til I walk up on you
And this shit don't make no sense, I'm rich, I was dead broke on the corner

It ain't nothin' for me to shop at—, I used to go for some Cognac
Where the fuck my flip phone at? This my throwaway
Fuck the police, fuck the judge, fuck the DEA

She wanna record, we 'bouta make a movie
She don't know what she'll do if she lose me
What would you do if you go broke? I'd be back rich in two weeks
What would you do for some promo? What would you do for some clout?
I'm in New York, more than Sheck Wes, lil' bitch, you know the scouts1Embed

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
She like, "Ain't you Ken Carson? Ain’t you Teen X?"
"Can you call your partner up for me and ask where them beans at?"
I told that bitch I love her, but I really did not mean that
My jeans, they Undercover and I'm rockin' a Blackmeans jacket
And my shoes, they undiscovered, bet you cannot find where these at
He wanna swag like me, yeah
He wanna be like Teen X
He wanna be like Teen Bean
Now he pourin’ up lean, and he rollin' up weed
Bought a Teen X hoodiе and a Teen X tee
Give a fuck 'bout that shit, you will never bе me
I go get some money and fuck on a freak
Her boyfriend coming home, so I gotta retreat
But I still got the top, so it's mission complete
I just fuck on that bitch, then I block and delete her
Might want her for the night, but I do not need her
I'm countin' up Franklins, ain't talkin' Aretha
I’m pourin’ up drank, and I'm rollin’ some weed up
I feel like a boss, I'm kickin' my feet up
If you don't wanna shoot, then you can get beat up
Got my gun and my shooter, my hands work too
I’m in the moshpit, punching out your crew
It ain't nowhere to go, he don't know what to do
I'm tweetin' on Twitter, I'm going up, ooh
I'm all on Instagram, I'm going up too
She love my aesthetic, she say that I'm cool

[Verse 2]
I don't move how you want me to move
I don't do what you want me to do
I do what I want, I do what I please
I don't do this for you, bitch, I do it for me
What I do for you, you wouldn't do it for me
I look out for you, like an owl in a tree
I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
I feel like the greatest, Muhammad Ali
I'm first and you last, like A and Z
Anything that I do, they pay me a fee
I'm countin' up blue, I'm countin' up green
Everywhere I go, they like, "Ain't this Teen Bean?"
Bitch, I'm Ken Carson, Ecstasy Teen
Your bitch a fan, yeah, she a fiend
We at my hotel, I'm breakin' her spleen
I'm breaking the rules, give a fuck what you think

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I'm breaking the rules

You can have all these riches, we still wouldn't be the same

Even if I go to the studio, I'ma still pull up on your main at three A.M
I pop out at night, bitch, I'm a real V-A-M-P
I'm a vampire, yeah
The only time I change is when I turn into a bat
That boy changed, we thought he was real, he turned to a rat
Hop out the cat, oh yeah, hop out the hell, oh yeah, Hellcat

Say he want some clean, but I sold him dust
For a bean, that bitch'll fuck both of us

Song Description: Similar to Nightcore, Ken raps about his affection to a woman and his willingness to go to extreme measures for her. As the song progresses, it introduces themes of love and materialism, juxtaposed with aggression through the verse.

Darker, more enigmatic imagery is introduced on the bridge, which alludes to internal conflict or a curse,  ultimately conveying convoluted emotions that reflect the artists inner conflicts and the fuzziness of the distinctions between love, materialism, and aggression.

I fuck on these hoes with the same energy I rock these shows with
And I ain't never gotta reload because I'm always overloaded
Lil' boy, you so broke, you better sell your soul 'cause you ain't ever sold shit
I'm always catchin' plays, ayy, ayy, just like a goalie
Chrome Hearts on my wrist, ayy, this a Rollie
VV-VV, bust down, this bitch frozen
Like a wide receiver, I had your ho wide open
Hell nah, I don’t need her, I just want her for the moment
If you ain’t ready to die 'bout me right now, leave me alone then
I be locked out, huh, and I be zoned in
I mean I be locked in and zoned out
I meant to text you back, huh, but I forgot
If I wanted to see her face, I would have flew her out
I’m havin' birds in the trap, I feel like Travis Scott
Yeah, the way lil' shawty movin', huh, I can’t believe my eyes
She ain't got no waist but she got perky titties and some thighs
I don't know if I want her or her right now, I can't decide
They said if you lyin' then you flyin', bitch, I'm fly
Yeah, lil' bitch, I'm fly, yeah, look up in the sky, yeah
It's not a plane, it's not a bird
It's X-Man, bitch, fuck what you heard

If niggas try me and my gang, yeah, yeah, we ready to purge
The way lil' shawty movin', yeah, yeah, I need her
The way lil' shawty movin', huh, she got me lost for words
And I don't know what's worse, my addictions or my random thoughts about her
She asked me why my cross upside down, I told her I'm cursed (Err)

They wanna put a lil' price on they coochie
But, nah, I ain't cool with what these niggas cool with

I just wanna get in her mouth, yeah, just like some dentures
I pass all my hoes to my bros, I ain't stingy
I switch up my hoes, like my clothes, this shit endless
I took her to the block, huh, you took that bitch to Fendi
You put her in Balenci' Crocs, I bought that bitch some Air Force 1s
I ain't gotta buy a bitch shit, 'cause I know they goin'
Tennis chains on
Watch, the ring goin'
I got that shit on
You can smell me from a mile away, I smell like weed and cologne
He mad his bitch got Ken Carson on her ring tone
She say that "Freestyle 2," huh, is her theme song
I fuck on that bitch and get outta there, huh, I had my jeans on
If you do your bitch wrong, I'ma give her a shoulder to lean on
I ain't goin' back-and-forth, huh, this not ping-pong
My hoes don't call me Ken Carson, they call me King Kong
Before I ever put a bitch, I'ma put my team on
Every day I'm in a different city, yeah, I'm switchin' timezone
And I don't ever got my mind, what yo' mind on?
Every day I get fresh, I got new designs on
Bitch, I'll never stress 'cause I smoke too much weed, yeah
I pour too much lean, yeah, I popped too many beans, yeah
I was cuttin' the corner, this bitch on two wheels, this a SRT, huh
Send the payment, if you wanna get a feature
Designer on my jacket, huh, and my feet, yeah
And I stay with a baddie, this is what I feed her
I hit a home run, with every ho, like Derek Jeter
My neck and wrist on froze, like I took it out the freezer
I made lil shawty cum and now she shakin' like a seizure
I get straight to it, I don't do no teasin'
I pleasure lil shawty, I do all the pleasin'
When it come to me and my shawty, we get way too freaky
And when I'm by myself, I get way too geeked, yeah
Every day I'm trying to get higher than the day before, I'm too fucked upYou might also like1Embed

I'ma let that shit hit with no silencer, I'ma let that boy know how the K sound

[Post-Chorus: Ken Carson]
You a bitch, you a dick rider, yeah, these niggas don't just be gay now
Fuck your bitch, then I'm out of there, I'm back on the block sellin' big pounds

You already knew what it was

Now she wanna fuck, 'cause I'm up
Now she wanna fuck, 'cause I'm lit

She fallin' for me, and you fallin' for her
I fuck on these bitches, I can't fall in love, yeah
I fuck on these bitches, I can't fall in love
I don't fuck with these niggas, I give 'em a mug
They askin' me, "Why?" I gave 'em a shrug
He claimin' he gang, but that boy a dub
Talk down on my name, we sendin' 'em slugs
I rock Helmut Lang, I'm swaggin' it up
I fucked on your main, she don't give a fuck about it
These niggas just talk, they ain't 'bout it
They be slippin', they ain't really slidin'
They just in the car, they ain't really riding
I swear, everything I do exotic
I swear, everything I do, these niggas know 'bout it
I go to the bank, I make a deposit
He broke and he stank, yeah, he ain't nobody
I can't remember shit, I was off molly
I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I can't feel my body
These bitches be ho'ing, these bitches be sloppy
For me, yeah, she goin', she empty your pockets
You bought her Chanel and I bought her some Takis
You bought her a bag, I bought her some chips
Either way it go, your bitch gettin' flipped
You still in here, she let me fuck off the rip
FN Five-seveN came with a grip
If it's a problem, shoot him in his lip
Raf Simons shirt, check out my drip
Your bitch a flirt, fuck her, then dip
I don't want her, I want a zip
Shoutout my plug, he get a tip
These niggas be scrubs, these niggas ain't built
They ain't nothin' like us, these niggas ain't real
If it go down, we know you gon' spill
I'm pourin' up lean, I'm crackin' the seal
I'm rollin' up weed, you know I got pills
You ain't high as me, lil' boy, need to chill
I get so high, I cannot feel
I want me a B, I want me some Ms
I'm talkin' 'bout them bills, I'm talkin' 'bout them mills
You procrastinate, and I go for the kill
Anything I want, I get it, for real
I work in this shit like a nine-to-five
I ain't goin' broke as long as I'm alive
Bitch, I'ma be chasin' the racks 'til I die
Fuck it, I'm flippin' these packs 'til I die
Fuck it, I'm breakin' her back 'til I die
Fuck it, I'm countin' these racks 'til I die
Let it stack 'til I die, let that shit multiply
