Artist: The Cure
Artist Description: The Cure (formed in 1976) are an English rock band, originally comprised of primary songwriter Robert Smith, drummer Lol Tolhurst, and bassist Michael Dempsey—later replaced by Simon Gallup. Before recording 1989’s Disintegration, Robert Smith became worried that his band would never record a masterpiece since he was approaching 30-years-of-age.

The Cure’s career to that point had been defined by a defiance against people’s expectations for them. Formed as a punk band, their label pushed them toward pop for their first album. Smith alienated half his bandmates by writing more somber music following a spell playing for Siouxsie And The Banshees. After reaching new heights with 1982’s Pornography, they nearly broke up before switching back to a more pop-oriented style. While gentle hints from the label played a role, so did Smith’s distaste for being pigeon-holed as “gothic.”

This was followed by a period of positive and eclectic sounds, peaking with 1987’s Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. The double album was a huge success, charting in America. The Cure were continually seen as a pop band, and Smith was more fed up than ever. He wrote songs that were true to his vision for The Cure, intent on making a masterpiece while he was still 29. With Disintegration, he certainly succeeded.

The group would continue to find success with subsequent releases, including their Greatest Hits compilation, their eponymous 2004 comeback record, and 2008’s 4:13 Dream.

In 2019, they were inducted into the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame.

Songs:

Title: Lovesong
Release Date: May 2, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-lovesong-lyrics
Song Description: Frontman Robert Smith wrote Lovesong as a wedding present for his bride-to-be Mary Poole in 1988.



Lovesong was the second UK and third US single from Disintegration, The Cures eighth studio album, and is the bands highest charting single in the United States, reaching #2 in late 1989.

Despite the songs enormous success, Smith has mixed feelings about the track. He expresses satisfaction in finally feeling comfortable enough to write a straightforward love song and feels the song keeps Disintegration from having only one mood  presumably gloom. However, he called it the weakest song on the album and expressed disappointment that it was the bands breakthrough single in the US.

Notable cover versions:


Rock band 311 covered the song for the film 50 First Dates

Singer-songwriter Adele covered it on her sophomore album 21

Rock band Anberlin covered it on their 2003 debut album Blueprints for the Black Market.

Title: Just Like Heaven
Release Date: October 5, 1987, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-just-like-heaven-lyrics
Song Description: Just Like Heaven was the third single from Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me It was inspired by a trip Robert Smith took with his then-girlfriend (future wife) Mary Poole to Beachy Head at East Sussex. Smith told Blender in 2003:

The song is about hyperventilating  kissing and fainting to the floor. Mary dances with me in the video because she was the girl, so it had to be her. The idea is that one night like that is worth 1,000 hours of drudgery.

Just Like Heaven was The Cures first top 40 hit in the US. It also reached the top 40 in France, New Zealand and the UK. In the summer of 1992, Smith called it the best pop song the Cure has ever done.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
"Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream," she said
"The one that makes me laugh," she said
Threw her arms around my neck
"Show me how you do it, and I promise you
I promise that I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you"

[Verse 2]
Spinning on that dizzy edge
Kissed her face and kissed her head
Dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow
"Why are you so far away?" she said
"Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?"

[Pre-Chorus]
You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water

[Chorus]
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name

And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

[Outro]
You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, just like heaven54Embed

Title: Friday I’m in Love
Release Date: May 11, 1992, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-friday-im-in-love-lyrics
Song Description: The second single from the bands ninth studio album, it became one of the bands most successful songs, reaching the top 40 in seven countries.  It is the Cures second highest-charting song in Ireland (#4), the UK (#6), New Zealand (#7) and the US (#18). It also topped the Modern Rock Chart in the US for four weeks.


I mean, Friday, Im In Love is not a work of genius, it was almost a calculated song. Its a really good chord progression, I couldnt believe no-one else had used it and I asked so many people at the time  I was getting drug paranoia anyway  I must have stolen this from somewhere, I cant possibly have come up with this. I asked everyone I knew, everyone.
- Robert Smith

Friday Im in Love is a dumb pop song, but its quite excellent actually, because its so absurd. Its so out of character  very optimistic and really out there in happy land. Its nice to get that counterbalance. People think were supposed to be leaders of some sort of gloom movement. I could sit and write gloomy songs all day long, but I just dont see the point.  Robert Smith, Spin Magazine, June 1992
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday, I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday, you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Chorus]
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

[Verse 2]
I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday, heart attack
Thursday, never looking back
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Instrumental]

You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
It's Friday, I'm in love

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I would say I'm sorry
If I thought that it would change your mind
But I know that this time
I have said too much, been too unkind

[Chorus]
I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

[Verse 2]
I would break down at your feet
And beg forgiveness, plead with you
But I know that it's too late
And now there's nothing I can do

Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry

Title: Pictures of You
Release Date: May 2, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-pictures-of-you-lyrics
Song Description: Pictures of You is the fourth and final single released from Disintegration. It reached the top 30 in the UK and Germany, and was a minor hit in the US and The Netherlands.

Smith has given different stories about what inspired the song. One is that it was written after a fire at Smiths house and he found pictures of his wife, Mary Poole in the wreckage  so the song was written in response to his nostalgia. Another story is that he once threw away all of his personal photos and home movies.

Yet another tale, found in the liner notes for the bands compilation album Galore, Smith wrote that the song was loosely based on an essay by Myra Poleo entitled The Dark Power of Ritual Pictures  after reading it I destroyed all my old personal photographs, and almost all of my home cine and video collection  I think I was trying to wipe away my past within days I was suffering great regret; I still am!

However, the name Myra Poleo is an anagram of his wifes maiden name Mary Poole, and no such poem has been found to exist. It must also be taken into consideration that Smith confessed to Smash News in 1985 that he lies to interviewers because I bore myself if I dont make things up.

The photo on the cover of the songs single is the same one used as the cover of Charlotte Sometimes, just not heavily distorted. Smith believes it was taken in Scotland in 1981 while on holiday.

The lyrics continue the atmospheric imagery of Plainsong, tying in the theme of  rain. Its music video shows the band in the snow dressed in winter clothing as it is revealed they are actually in the tropics surrounded by palm trees, a concept also found in their 1987 b-side Snow In Summer. Keyboardist Roger O'Donnell called the experience miserable and freezing.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel

[Verse 2]
Remembering you standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close
How I always held close in your fear

[Verse 3]
Remembering you running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go

[Verse 4]
Remembering you fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white, so delicate, lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark

Remembering you, how you used to be
Slow drowned, you were angels, so much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes, but I never see anything

If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

[Verse 6]
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
And always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

[Outro]
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
All my pictures of you24Embed

Title: Lullaby
Release Date: May 2, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-lullaby-lyrics
Song Description: Lullaby was the first single from Disintegration overseas. It was originally going to be the first US single as well, but as Smith explained, We were on a film soundtrack (Lost Angels) with Fascination Street, so we put that out in America instead.

It is the bands highest charting single in their home country  their only to reach the top 5 in the UK  and reached the top 30 in eight more countries overseas. In the US, it peaked at #74.

Tim Pope, the songs music video director and frequent collaborator with The Cure, interprets the song as an allegory for Robert Smiths drug-laden past. The video won the Best Video award at the 1990 BRIT Awards.

The song was inspired by an uncle who told songwriter Robert Smith scary stories at bedtime about a spiderman who ate children.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I spy with the corner of my little eye
Something beginning with "S"

[Verse 1]
On candy-stripe legs the spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realise with fright
That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

[Verse 2]
Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

[Bridge]
And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering, furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the spiderman is always hungry

Title: Disintegration
Release Date: May 2, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-disintegration-lyrics
Song Description: Disintegration is the title track to its companion album for good reason  it was the launching point for the entire project, which drew inspiration from Robert Smiths bleak outlook on life as he turned 29 years old in the spring of 1988.

Overwhelmed with dark thoughts, brought on by a combination of depression and heavy LSD use, Smith wrote Disintegration, as Rolling Stone writer Andy Greene calls it, as essentially an acknowledgment that his drug addiction may end his life combined with obvious references to infidelity with a younger lover that leads to the protagonists abandonment of his family.

Disintegration is a fan favorite. It was voted the #4 best Cure song in a 2016 Rolling Stone readers' poll.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

[Verse 2]
I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

[Chorus]
But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be
You might also like[Verse 3]
So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over

[Bridge]
And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again

[Chorus]
But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
Screaming it over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
And stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
And songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the end always is
How the end always is
[Outro]
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
Always is

I've waited hours for this, I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought this day would end
I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me

[Verse 2]
Just try to see in the dark, just try to make it work
To feel the fear before you're here
I make the shapes come much too close
I pull my eyes out, hold my breath and wait until I shake

[Chorus]
But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
Oh, if only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

See into the dark

Calling my name
The sound is deep
In the dark
I hear her voice
And start to run
Into the trees

Release Date: April 21, 1992, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-a-letter-to-elise-lyrics
Song Description: The third single from their 1992 album Wish, this rarely performed track was a direct reference to Kafkas Letters to Felice, which Robert Smith drew inspiration from when recording.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Oh, Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same the way we act out
Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

[Verse 2]
Oh, Elise it doesn't matter what you do
I know I'll never really get inside of you
To make your eyes catch fire the way they should
The way the blue could pull me in
If they only would, if they only would
At least I'd lose this sense of sensing
Something else that hides away
From me and you, there're worlds to part
With aching looks and breaking hearts
And all the prayers your hands can make
Oh, I just take as much as you can throw
And then throw it all away
Oh, I'll throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky, like throwing arms round yesterday

[Bridge]
I stood and stared wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back the way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away the way you do
Elise, believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke and make-believe ran out

Title: Plainsong
Release Date: May 2, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-plainsong-lyrics
Song Description: The opener to The Cures magnum-opus Disintegration is as grandiose as the album itself. Its lush, orchestral melodies introduce the album for over two and half minutes before Smith eventually adds vocals.

Plainsong is the name given for Gregorian chants and other Catholic liturgies. The track has an enchanting, almost trance-like meter, similar to that of a religious chant.

The song outlines a somber, introspective conversation happening between two people, sung in Smiths less-often used soft delivery. It has no verse/chorus structure, but rather a back and forth, with the lines spoken in the first person repeated.

The recurrent sound of chimes and flowing basslines set the scene of a cold wind or quiet storm, establishing a bleak mood that carries forward throughout the album.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
“I think it's dark, and it looks like rain,” you said
“And the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world,” you said
“And it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead”
And then you smiled for a second

[Verse 2]
“I think I'm old, and I'm feeling pain,” you said
“And it's all running out like it's the end of the world,” you said
“It's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead”
And then you smiled for a second

[Bridge]
Sometimes you make me feel
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
“It's just the way I smile,” you said

Release Date: October 18, 1983, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-the-lovecats-lyrics
Song Description: Despite its fun, frolicking feel, Robert Smith told Humo Magazine The Lovecats was written about a suicide pact between two lovers. However, he has also said it was close to being a perfect pop song and was inspired by the Disney film Aristocats.

It became the bands first UK top 10 hit, peaking at #7 in late 1983. It remains their 2nd biggest hit to date there behind 1989s Lullaby.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
We move like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer than this
The way we walk, the way we talk
The way we stalk, the way we kiss

[Verse 2]
We slip through the streets while everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker and wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night
Let's go and throw all the songs we know

[Chorus]
Into the sea, you and me
All these years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the love cats
We missed you hissed the love cats

[Bridge]
We're so wonderfully, wonderfully
Wonderfully, wonderfully pretty
Oh, you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to tea, huh
We should have each other with cream
Then curl up in the fire and sleep for awhile
It's the grooviest thing, it's the perfect dream

Hand in hand is the only way to land
And always the right way round
Not broken in pieces, like hated little meeces
How could we miss someone as dumb as this?

Song Description: Fascination Street was written by songwriter Robert Smith about one particular band adventure to Bourbon Street, New Orleans in 1985.

It was the first US single from the album Disintegration and the bands first song to hit #1 on the newly-created Billboard Modern Rock chart. The song also performed admirably on the Pop Chart as well, peaking at #46. MTV had its music video in heavy rotation that July. It was not released as a single in the UK.

Fascination Street was also featured on the soundtrack to the 1989 indie film Lost Angels.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Oh, it's opening time down on Fascination Street
So let's cut the conversation and get out for a bit
Because I feel it all fading and paling, and I'm begging
To drag you down with me to kick the last nail in

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I like you in that like I like you to scream
But if you open your mouth, then I can't be responsible
For quite what goes in or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair, just pull on your pout

[Verse 3]
And let's move to the beat like we know that it's over
If you slip going under, slip over my shoulder
So just pull on your face, just pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street

[Verse 4]
So pull on your hair, pull on your pout
Cut the conversation, just open your mouth
Pull on your face, pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street

Title: One Hundred Years
Release Date: May 4, 1982, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-one-hundred-years-lyrics
Song Description: The first track off of 1982s Pornography, The Cure open up their gothic piece de resistance with an innovative wildly flanging guitar, and African polyrhythmics. Smiths opening words: It doesnt matter if we all die are a sampling of the bleak existentialism and in many cases pessimism that will dot the album. The song is about the drollness of post industrial life and at some points a parallel to the book 1984 by George Orwell in allusions to police patrolling streets under the night and shooting rebels down.

While Smith has never come out and said that the song (or its title) were inspired by The Hundred Years War, it should be noted that The Hundred Years War was a long-running bloody conflict between England and France about which family line should have the French throne. It is possible that the songs metaphors of personal suffering are being compared to the Hundred Years War (or simply its title).

One Hundred Years showed up on the 10" single and double 7" gatefold single of The Hanging Garden (often labeled as A Single). However, a UK promotional 7" was released that put One Hundred Years on the A-side and The Hanging Garden as its B-side.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It doesn't matter if we all die
Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Going home time, a story on the radio

[Verse 2]
Something small falls out of your mouth and we laugh
A prayer for something better
A prayer for something better
Please love me
Meet my mother, but the fear takes hold
Creeping up the stairs in the dark
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow

[Verse 3]
Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
Fighting for freedom on the television
Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs
Have we got everything?
She struggles to get away
The pain and the creeping feeling, a little black haired girl
Waiting for Saturday, the death of her father pushing her
Pushing her white face into the mirror
Aching inside me and turn me 'round
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days

Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room
The soldiers close in under a yellow moon
All shadows and deliverance under a black flag
A hundred years of blood, crimson
The ribbon tightens round my throat
I open my mouth and my head bursts open
A sound like a tiger thrashing in the water
Thrashing in the water
Over and over, we die one after the other
Over and over, we die one after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other

Title: Alone
Release Date: September 26, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-alone-lyrics
Song Description: Alone is the first single and opening track of Songs Of A Lost World. It was inspired by the Ernest Dowson poem Dregs.

Post-punk.com describes the song as:

Enveloped in a brooding, slow-burning atmosphere, Alone conjures a sense of introspection, carried by mournful keys, a crawling tempo, and the bands signature melancholic guitar tones.

The Independent shared:

Alone marries warping nu-shoegaze clatter to crackling antique strings.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
This is the end of every song that we sing
The fire burned out to ash and the stars grown dim with tears
Cold and afraid, the ghosts of all that we've been
We toast with bitter dregs, to our emptiness

[Verse 2]
And the birds falling out of our skies
And the words falling out of our minds
And here is to love, to all the love
Falling out of our lives
Hopes and dreams are gone
The end of every song

[Chorus]
And it all stops
We were always sure that we would never changе
And it all stops
We were always surе that we would stay the same
But it all stops
And we close our eyes to sleep
To dream a boy and girl
Who dream the world is nothing but a dream

Title: Endsong
Release Date: November 1, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-endsong-lyrics
Song Description: Endsong, the closing track of The Cures 14th studio album, was inspired by a starlit night that reminded Robert Smith of a similar evening in 1969, stargazing in the back garden with his father when Apollo 11 landed on the moon.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
And I'm outside in the dark staring at the blood red moon
Remembering the hopes and dreams I had and all I had to do
And wondering what became of that boy and the world he called his own
I'm outside in the dark wondering how I got so old

[Chorus]
It's all gone, it's all gone
Nothing left of all I loved
It all feels wrong
It's all gone, it's all gone, it's all gone
No hopes, no dreams, no world
No, I don't belong
I don't belong here anymore

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
It's all gone, it's all gone
I will lose myself in time
It won't be long
It's all gone, it's all gone, it's all gone

Title: And Nothing Is Forever
Release Date: November 1, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-and-nothing-is-forever-lyrics
Song Description: And Nothing Is Forever was the third song from Songs of a Lost World to be performed live on the Cures 2022 tour (after Alone and Endsong), first played on October 10th in Stockholm.

Thematically, the Independent revealed And Nothing Is Forever is:

a song about a promise Smith made to be with someone on their deathbed
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Promise you'll be with me in the end
Say we’ll be together and that you won't forget
However far away (However far away)
You will remember me in time
Promise you'll be with me in the end
Say we’ll be together and with no regret
However far away (However far away)
You will remember me tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And slide down close beside me
In the silence of a heartbeat
And wrap your arms around me
In a murmured lullaby
As the memory of the first time
In the stillness of a teardrop
As you hold me for the last time
In the dying of the life

[Chorus]
I know, I know
That my world has grown old
And nothing is forever
I know, I know
That my world has grown old
But it really doesn't matter
If you say we'll be together
If you promise you'll be with me in the end

Title: Killing an Arab
Release Date: December 21, 1978, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-killing-an-arab-lyrics
Song Description: Killing An Arab was the first single released by The Cure. It was inspired by the pivotal moment in the 1942 novel The Stranger by Albert Camus where the protagonist shoots his friends mistress' brother, a man identified in the book only as the Arab. It is the apathy of the main character that is the focus of this song.

The song has been controversial since 1979, when a college asked the band not to perform it as it sounded racist.

In 1986, its inclusion on the bands singles collection Standing On A Beach was protested by the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. A compromise was reached when the band agreed to label each unit with a sticker announcing the following:

The song Killing an Arab has absolutely no racist overtones whatsoever. It is a song which decries the existence of all prejudice and consequent violence. The Cure condemn its use in furthering anti-Arab feeling.

In 1987, Smith shared his opinion of the controversy in a fanzine:

i felt the whole issue absurd and unnecessary and i am relieved that it has been concluded (and forgotten?) imaginatively and intelligently and with mutual satisfaction.(almost)

In 1991, this song (along with Rock The Casbah by The Clash) unofficially became war-rallying cries for the US invasion of Iraq, much to the bands dislike.

In 2016, Lol Tolhurst was asked if he thought releasing Killing An Arab as the bands first single was a bold move. He responded:

I didnt think it was so bold back when we wrote it. It was about alienation and existentialism  things more relevant to us then. Obviously events of the last two decades have changed the perception of the songs meaning. Totally erroneously I might add, as it has nothing to do with racism or killing at all.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Standing on the beach with a gun in my hand
Staring at the sky, staring at the sand
Staring down the barrel at the Arab on the ground
I can see his open mouth, but I hear no sound

[Chorus]
I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an Arab

[Verse 2]
I can turn and walk away or I can fire the gun
Staring at the sky, staring at the sun
Whichever I chose, it amounts to the same
Absolutely nothing

[Chorus]
I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an Arab

[Verse 3]
I feel the steel butt jump, smooth in my hand
Staring at the sea, staring at the sand
Staring at myself reflected in the eyes
Of the dead man on the beach

Title: Pornography
Release Date: May 4, 1982, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-pornography-lyrics
Song Description: The Cures landmark gothic rock album, Pornography, closes with perhaps the groups most harrowing and difficult track to date. It opens with a cacophony of voices whose words are near-impossible to make out, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere that mirrors Robert Smiths drug-induced schizophrenia. Lol Tolhursts pounding toms gradually fade in, followed by a menacing organ and bass sound. Smiths vocals and dissonant guitar bursts then add fuel to the fire of this hellish concoction.

The lyrical content is akin to that of the albums opening track, One Hundred Years, a series of images which dont really connect or flow in any way, painting a picture of violent and chaotic destruction. The precise meaning of the lyrics is frequently debated amongst Cure fans, as most of Pornography was written streams of consciousness while Smith was high or drunk, making the words extremely difficult to interpret.
Lyrics:

[Sample 1: Robin Whitting - reversed]
Well, in just a moment, we finally put BBC 2 to bed, but, a reminder that there's a treat in store for opera lovers starting tomorrow evening with a sparkling performance from the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden of one of the world's best-loved Romantic operas: Pavarotti [?] Puccini at five-past-eight tomorrow. Well now there's the last look at the clock this eve, and the time's just winding its way round to eight minutes to one. If you're still up and about and want a bit more entertainment, a reminder that our colleagues over at BBC Radio are still on the airwaves. On Radio 2 in eight minutes Sheila Tracey - that's Radio 2's "Tiger Tim" - takes over with the Truckers' Hour, and then at 2 o'clock You and the Night and the Music with Tim Gudgin through 'til five. But for now, on behalf of everyone here on BBC 2, this is Robin Whitting-

[Sample 2]
Yeah, a green sedan. No, the licence plates were covered with mud. They took tyres and gas. (Tell him they took all the cash.) They robbed the cash register too. I got word that the police had them bottled up... but they slipped through again. (I wonder if the baby is born yet.) Poor Joan. They're being blamed for every crime committed in the country

[Sample 3: Germaine Greer and Graham Chapman]
[Incomprehensible]

[Verse 1]
A hand in my mouth, a life spills into the flowers
We all look so perfect as we all fall down
In an electric glare, the old man cracks with age
She found his last picture in the ashes of the fire

[Verse 2]
An image of the queen echoes round the sweating bed
Sour yellow sounds inside my head
In books and films and in life and in heaven
The sound of slaughter as your body turns

[Refrain]
But it's too late
But it's too late

[Verse 3]
One more day like today and I'll kill you
A desire for flesh and real blood
And I'll watch you drown in the shower
Pushing my life through your open eyes

Title: Let’s Go to Bed
Release Date: November 15, 1982, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-lets-go-to-bed-lyrics
Song Description: After releasing three consecutively more gloomy albums, each supported by stressful tours and an ever-increasing use of drugs, The Cure had self-destructed. Primary songwriter Robert Smith left London for his childhood home to recover.

He emerged with the intention of alienating what was left of his fanbase of intense, menacing, psychotic goths by reinventing himself as a pop star. After his record company told him he couldnt write a hit, he returned with Lets Go To Bed  a contrived song he considered a hideous piece of commercial pap that was bad on purpose.

But Smiths plan to show his record company that writing a hit would finish the band off backfired:

I thought it was stupid. Its rubbish, its a joke  everything I hated about music at that time. It was junk. Lol (Tolhurst) and I recorded it, Fiction (Records) put it out, and suddenly were getting 15 plays a day on American radio. Sods law, isnt it?

Lets Go To Bed reached #44 in the UK, #17 in New Zealand and began the dichotomy of The Cures sound as both underground goth and alternative pop.

Over time, Smith warmed up to the song saying in 1986 that he had begun enjoying performing it live.

Title: The Same Deep Water as You
Release Date: May 2, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-the-same-deep-water-as-you-lyrics
Song Description: The Same Deep Water As You is one of a few select songs that songwriter Robert Smith considers very special and personal to him.

It is the longest song on Disintegration, but despite being over nine minutes long and never having been released as a single, it was still voted the #7 best Cure song in a 2016 Rolling Stone readers' poll, beating out 28 of the bands 32 UK Top 75 hits.

Rolling Stone staff writer Andy Greene describes it as a nine-minute song about an intense love affair that seems hopelessly doomed. NME writer Barbara Ellen shared that The Same Deep Water is about somebody admitting that he is not up to her depth of emotion and loyalty.

It is also noteworthy that this track falls after Prayers for Rain. The sound of thunder opens the song, so the narrator gets what he asked for. The storm that ensues is so great that the narrator drowns.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Kiss me goodbye, pushing out before I sleep
Can't you see I try?
Swimming the same deep water as you is hard
"The shallow drowned lose less than we," you breathe
The strangest twist upon your lips
"And we shall be together
We shall be together"

[Verse 2]
"Kiss me goodbye, bow your head, and join with me"
And face pushed deep, reflections meet
The strangest twist upon your lips
And disappear, the ripples clear
And laughing, break against your feet
And laughing, break the mirror sweet
"So we shall be together
So we shall be together"

[Verse 3]
"Kiss me goodbye," pushing out before I sleep
It's lower now, and slower now
The strangest twist upon your lips
But I don't see, and I don't feel
But tightly hold up silently
My hands, before my fading eyes
And in my eyes your smile
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go

Title: M
Release Date: April 22, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-m-lyrics
Song Description: M was one of the earliest songs written for Seventeen Seconds. It was written before the previous album Three Imaginary Boys was released.

The letter M as the songs title is an abbreviation of Mary, the first name of Mary Poole, who was Robert Smiths girlfriend at the time; the two later married.

As Smith mentioned in a Q&A in the Cure News #6 fanzine from 1989, M was a nickname he used for her:


do you and Mary have nick-names for each other? if so, what are they?

i call her m. she calls me anything she wants; it changes depending on what time it is
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Hello image

You'll fall in love with somebody else tonight

You reveal all the secrets to remember the end
And escape someday

Title: Burn
Release Date: March 29, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-burn-lyrics
Song Description: James O'Barr, creator of the comic book The Crow, is a big fan of The Cure. In fact, he dedicated a full page in his book to reprinting the lyrics of their song The Hanging Garden.  When the 1994 film based on the comic was in production, O'Barr asked The Cure for the use of The Hanging Garden. Robert Smith was, in turn, a fan of The Crow and instead wrote Burn for the film.

Burn was written and recorded while the band had only two members  Smith & drummer Boris Williams, and it was completed in only two days:

 I had the idea, and we just recorded it, me and him, in the studio.

In 2020, Stabbing Westward covered the song .
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
"Don't look, don't look," the shadows breathe
Whispering me away from you
"Don't wake at night to watch her sleep
You know that you will always lose
This trembling, adored
Tousled, birdmad girl"

[Chorus 1]
But every night I burn, every night I call your name
Every night I burn, every night I fall again

[Verse 2]
"Oh, don't talk of love," the shadows purr
Murmuring me away from you
"Don't talk of worlds that never were
The end is all that's ever true
There's nothing you can ever say
Nothing you can ever do"

[Chorus 2]
Still every night I burn, every night I scream your name
Every night I burn, every night the dream's the same

Title: A Night Like This
Release Date: August 26, 1985, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-a-night-like-this-lyrics
Song Description: A Night Like This was the third and final single from The Head On The Door, but its origins reach all the way back to 1976 when the band performed it at their second gig while still named Malice. The original song soon morphed into what became Plastic Passion, however years later, A Night Like This was revived and updated for this album.

Unlike the previous two singles which each charted in at least six countries, this one did not chart. It was included on the CD releases of the 1986 singles collection Staring At The Sea, but not on the vinyl & cassette editions, which were titled Standing On A Beach.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Say goodbye on a night like this
If it's the last thing we ever do
You never looked as lost as this
Sometimes it doesn't even look like you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It goes dark, it goes darker still
Please stay
But I watch you like I'm made of stone
As you walk away

[Chorus 1]
I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night
A witch hunt for another girl
For always and ever is always for you

Say it every time you move
The way that you look at me now

Song Description: In a fanzine, Robert Smith shared that The Figurehead was inspired by a grotesque skull sculpture I discovered in the disused asylum we used in the Charlotte Sometimes video. I took it home to talk to  to confess to  and this song is about guilt.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Sharp and open, leave me alone
And sleeping less every night
As the days become heavier and weighted
Waiting in the cold light
A noise, a scream tears my clothes as the figurines tighten
With spiders inside them
And dust on the lips of a vision of hell
I laughed in the mirror for the first time in a year

[Verse 2]
A hundred other words blind me with your purity
Like an old painted doll in the throes of dance
I think about tomorrow, please let me sleep
As I slip down the window, freshly squashed fly
You mean nothing
You mean nothing

[Verse 3]
I can lose myself in Chinese art and American girls
All the time, lose me in the dark, please do it right
Run into the night, I will lose myself tomorrow
Crimson pain, my heart explodes
My memory in a fire, and someone will listen

Song Description: In 2014, Billboard described Disintegrations last track Untitled as so depressing that Smith couldnt even give it a name. NME shared in 1989, Smiths lyrical agony of indecision is remorseless on the track.

Roger O'Donnell shared on his website that bassist Simon Gallup wrote the songs music.
Lyrics:

Hopelessly adrift in the eyes of the ghost again
Down on my knees and my hands in the air again
Pushing my face in the memory of you again
But I never know if it's real
Never know how I wanted to feel
Never quite said what I wanted to say to you
Never quite managed the words to explain to you
Never quite knew how to make them believable
And now the time has gone
Another time undone

[Verse 2]
Never quite said what I wanted to say to you
Never quite managed the words to explain to you
Never quite knew how to make them believable

Song Description: Last Dance was written about the experience of encountering a person you havent seen for a long time that you once had strong feelings for, but no longer do.

It was one of two songs not included on the original vinyl pressings of Disintegration, due to time limitations of the medium, and therefore listed as a bonus track on the cassette and CD releases.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending our last dance together
Expectantly, too punctual, but prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But older than me now, more constant, more real
And the fur and the mouth and the innocence turned
To hair and contentment that hangs in abasement
A woman now standing where once there was only a girl

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
Walking through walls in the heart of December
The blindness, the happiness, falling down laughing
But I really believed that this time was forever
But Christmas falls late now, flatter and colder
And never as bright as when we used to fall
All this in an instant before I can kiss you
A woman now standing where once there was only a girl

[Bridge]
(Your name like ice into my heart)

[Verse 3]
I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending our last dance together
Reluctantly, cautiously, but prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But Christmas falls late now, flatter and colder
And never as bright as when we used to fall
And even if we drink, I don't think we will kiss
In the way that we did when the woman was only a girlYou might also like12Embed

Title: Siamese Twins
Release Date: May 4, 1982, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-siamese-twins-lyrics
Song Description: After stating that The Hanging Garden was written about the purity and hate of animals fucking, he added And I think "Siamese Twins is about the hate and purity of people fucking too"

Some fans believe the song is a metaphorical description of a quite psychologically traumatic first sexual intercourse, losing virginity to a prostitute, as seen through the prism of narrators twisted, morbid, traumatized imagination in a style somewhat resembling stream of consciousness, involving a series of striking images, torn out of time just like our memories are. He painfully recalls every single detail of the past night over and over, exaggerating it to the point where narrative becomes nightmarish and disturbing. The name of the song is a metaphor for a heterosexual intercourse, where a man and a woman become intertwined as if they were a single creature, just as Siamese Twins are, and, in case of the narrator, start hating each other, just as the aforementioned Siamese Twins might.

Siamese Twins is one of the instrumentally lighter tracks on the album, with a sonic emptiness akin to what is heard on Seventeen Seconds and Faith, but Smiths tortured vocals and Lol Tolhursts pounding drum cycle help sustain its dramatic intensity.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I chose an eternity of this
Like falling angels, the world disappeared
Laughing into the fire, is it always like this?
Flesh and blood and the first kiss
The first colours, the first kiss

[Verse 2]
We writhed under a red light
Voodoo smile, Siamese twins
Girl at the window looks at me for an hour
Then everything falls apart
Broken inside me, it falls apart

[Chorus]
The walls and the ceiling move in time
Push a blade into my hands, slowly up the stairs
And into the room, is it always like this?

[Verse 3]
Dancing in my pocket
Worms eat my skin
She glows and grows with arms outstretched
Her legs around me, in the morning I cried

[Verse 4]
Leave me to die, you won't remember my voice
I walked away and grew old
You never talk, we never smile
I scream "you're nothing
I don't need you any more, you're nothing"
It fades and spins
It fades and spins

Sing out loud, we all die

Fox in Socks
The Cat in the Hat
The cover art and MV evoke the Space Shuttle Columbia final flight:







Why cant I (Sally Ride) be U ( Christa McAuliffe) lips.

But The Cure built an escape clause:

You're so wonderful, too good to be true

Everything you do is simply delicate
Everything you do is quite angelicate

Title: Cold
Release Date: May 14, 1982, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-cold-lyrics
Song Description: Introduced by an ominous cello line (played by Robert Smith himself), crashing, plodding drums soon pull Cold into a synth-laden abyss of sound. The track is slow and formidable, with lyrics dealing with the effect of drugs in Pornographys uniquely ambiguous manner.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Scarred, your back was turned, curled like an embryo
Take another face, you will be kissed again
I was cold as l mouthed the words and crawled across the mirror
And wait, await the next breath

[Refrain]
Your name like ice into my heart

[Verse 2]
A shallow grave, a monument to the ruined age
Ice in my eyes and eyes like ice don't move
Screaming at the moon, another past time

[Refrain]
Your name like ice into my heart

[Verse 3]
Everything as cold as life (Can no one save you?)
Everything as cold as silence (And you will never say a word)

Title: From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea
Release Date: April 21, 1992, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-from-the-edge-of-the-deep-green-sea-lyrics
Song Description: In 1992, a Rolling Stone reviewer described From The Edge Of The Deep Green Sea as:

about a troubled couple who debate loyalty and betrayal as the man observes that the womans head seems on fire
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Every time we do this, I fall for her
Wave after wave after wave, it's all for her
"I know this can't be wrong", I say
And I'll lie to keep her happy as long as I know that you know
That today I belong right here with you
Right here with you

[Verse 2]
And so we watch the sun come up from the edge of the deep green sea
And she listens like her head's on fire like she wants to believe in me
So I try, put your hands in the sky
Surrender, remember
We'll be here forever and we'll never say goodbye

[Verse 3]
I've never been so colourfully see through head before
(I've never been) I've never been so wonderfully me you want some more
And all I want is to keep it like this, you and me alone, a secret kiss
And don't go home, don't go away, don't let this end, please stay
Not just for today

[Verse 4]
"Never, never, never, never
Never, never, never, never, never let me go", she says
"Hold me like this for a hundred thousand million days"
But suddenly she slows and looks down at my breaking face
"Why do you cry? What did I say?"
"But it's just rain", I smile brushing my tears away

I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears, too many times
Too many years I've cried over you
Over you
Over you

[Bridge]
How much more can we use it up?
Drink it dry? Take this drug?
Looking for something forever gone
But something we will always want

[Verse 5]
"Why, why, why are you letting me go?" she says
"I feel you pulling back, I feel you changing shape"
And just as I'm breaking free, she hangs herself in front of me
Slips her dress like a flag to the floor
And hands in the sky, surrenders it all

[Chorus]
I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears, too many times
Too many years I've cried for you
It's always the same, wake up in the rain
Head in pain, hung in shame
A different name, same old game, love in vain
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
And miles away from home again9Embed

Title: Prayers for Rain
Release Date: May 2, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-prayers-for-rain-lyrics
Song Description: AllMusic reviewer Ned Raggett calls Prayers For Rain the heart of Disintegration, an evocative, wounding portrayal of emotional desolation.

Water serves as a metaphor for the feeling of hope and enthusiasm toward life. Hence, prayers for rain are a wish for renewed hope, likened to the way a man lost in a desert begs for rain as he dies of thirst.

Prayers For Rain begins side two on the original vinyl and cassette releases of Disintegration and marks the approximate halfway point of the album in any format.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You shatter me, your grip on me
A hold on me so dull it kills
You stifle me, infectious sense
Of hopelessness and prayers for rain

[Verse 2]
I suffocate, I breathe in dirt
And nowhere shines but desolate and drab
The hours all spent on killing time again
All waiting for the rain

[Chorus]
You fracture me, your hands on me
A touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me, entangle me
In hopelessness and prayers for rain

[Verse 3]
I deteriorate, I live in dirt
And nowhere glows but drearily and tired
The hours all spent on killing time again
All waiting for the rain

[Chorus]
You fracture me, your hands on me
A touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me, entangle me
In hopelessness and prayers for rain

Title: Homesick
Release Date: May 2, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-homesick-lyrics
Song Description: Homesick is the last song that founding member Laurence Lol Tolhurst contributed to while still a member of The Cure.

Technically, all of the songs on the album are credited to all six band members. But in reality, Homesick is the only track of which founding member Laurence Lol Tolhurst was actually involved in the writing process. He was no longer in the band by the time they were preparing to tour in support of Disintegration.

Even still, keyboardist Roger O'Donnell, who was recruited to fill the void Tolhursts alcoholism had created, would later claim whenever band leader Robert Smith was made aware of Tolhursts involvement, he threatened to take it off of the album. O'Donnell and bassist Simon Gallup didnt want Tolhurst to feel left out of the songwriting, so they reworked it. The songs original working title was The Tale of the Lonely Badge.

It was originally one of two bonus tracks included on the CD and cassette releases of Disintegration, but not included on the original vinyl edition due to the time constraints of the medium. However, the 2010 double LP vinyl reissue does include both previously omitted tracks.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey
Just one more and I'll walk away
All the everything you win turns to nothing today
And I forget how to move when my mouth is this dry
And my eyes are bursting hearts in a blood-stained sky
Oh it was sweet, it was wild
And, oh, how we
I trembled, stuck in honey, honey
Cling to me
So just one more, just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me to never go home
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do, do, do
Do-do-do, do-do, do

[Verse 2]
Ah, just one more and I'll walk away
All the everything you win turns to nothing today
So just one more, just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me to never go home
To never go home
Do-do, do, do, do, do, do

Release Date: October 9, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-a-fragile-thing-lyrics
Song Description: A Fragile Thing is the second single released in advance of The Cures fourteenth album Songs of a Lost World.

It was first performed live  on November 4, 2022 in Italy. The official studio recording dropped on October 9, 2024. A 7" vinyl single featuring two remixes of the song followed in November.

Stereogum described the track as a lush and expansive rocker.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
"Every time you kiss me, I could cry," she said
"Don't tell me how you miss me, I could die tonight of a broken heart
This loneliness has changed me, we have been too far apart
And it's too late now for me to just forget
I never thought I'd need to feel regret for all I never was
But all this time alone has left me hurt and sad and lost
Yeah, every time you kiss me, I could cry
Don't tell me how you miss me, I could die tonight of a broken heart
This loneliness has changed me, we have been too far apart"

[Chorus]
"And there's nothing you can do to change it back," she said
"Nothing you can do but sing, 'This love is a fragile thing'
Nothing you can do now but pretend again"
"Nothing you can do to change it back," she said
"Nothing you can do but sing, 'This love is a fragile thing'
'This love is my everything'
But nothing you can do to change the end"

[Post-Chorus]
No, nothing you can do (Nothing you can do, nothing you can do)

[Verse 2]
"Every time you leave me is a lie," she said
"You make-believe you need me, but you try too hard and it feels so wrong
You promise me forever and you say it won't be long
But it's too late now for me to just forget
I never thought I'd need to feel regret for all I never was
But all this time alone has left me hurt and sad and lost
Yeah, every time you leave me is a lie
You make-believe you need me, but you try too hard and it feels so wrong
You promise me forever and you say it won't be long"

Title: I Can Never Say Goodbye
Release Date: November 1, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-i-can-never-say-goodbye-lyrics
Song Description: In October 2022, The Cure debuted I Can Never Say Goodbye live in concert. It was written about the death of his brother Richard:

I wrote this song a lot of different ways, until I hit on a very simple narrative of what actually happened on the night he died.

On October 1, 2024, the band released a limited edition 12" doube A-sided vinyl single featuring a live version of this song and And Nothing Is Forever, recorded in France in 2022. A month later, the studio version appeared on Songs Of A Lost World.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Thunder rolling in to drown
November moon in cold black rain
This lightning splits the sky apart
And whispering his name
He has to wake up
Love slipping away
Hear the bells beyond the sea
It's almost too late
Shadows growing closer now
And there is nowhere left to hide
And I can't wake this dreamless sleep
However hard I try
I'm down on my knees
And empty inside

[Chorus]
Something wicked this way comes
From out the cruel and treacherous night
Something wicked this way comes
To steal away my brother's lifе
Something wicked this way comes
I can nеver say goodbye

Title: Jumping Someone Else’s Train
Release Date: November 2, 1979, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-jumping-someone-elses-train-lyrics
Song Description: Jumping Someone Elses Train was originally a standalone single, the third released by The Cure. It was not included on the bands debut album Three Imaginary Boys, but was included on the North American version of the album Boys Dont Cry a year later.

Smith wrote the lyrics about the late 1970s mod revival fad that was happening at the time. It was the last song recorded with original bassist Michael Dempsey before his exit.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Don't say what you mean, you might spoil your face
If you walk in the crowd, you won't leave any trace
It's always the same
You're jumping someone else's train

[Verse 2]
It won't take you long to learn the new smile
You'll have to adapt or you'll be out of style
It's always the same
You're jumping someone else's train

[Chorus]
If you pick up on it quick
You can say you were there
Again and again and again
You're jumping someone else's train

[Bridge]
It's the latest wave that you've been craving for
The old ideal was getting such a bore
Now you're back in line
Going not quite as far but in half the time
Everyone's happy, they're finally all the same

Song Description: 10:15 Saturday Night was first released in 1978 as the B-side to The Cures debut single, Killing an Arab. The song was included as the opening song on their debut album Three Imaginary Boys.

Smith wrote it early on, when the band was still known as Easy Cure, at his kitchen table one night his evening had fallen apart and he was feeling sorry for himself.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
10:15 on a Saturday night
And the tap drips under the strip light
And I'm sitting in the kitchen sink
And the tap drips

Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip

Title: How Beautiful You Are
Release Date: May 5, 1987, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-how-beautiful-you-are-lyrics
Song Description: How Beautiful You Are was not released as a single, but a remix exclusively for radio stations appeared on a 1987 sampler. It was remixed by Bob Clearmountain, who also remixed Just Like Heaven for its single release. That remix of How Beautiful You Are was eventually included on the 2004 rarities collection Join The Dots.

The lyrics of the song were inspired by the poem The Eyes of the Poor by French poet Charles Baudelaire.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You want to know why I hate you? Well, I'll try and explain
You remember that day in Paris when we wandered through the rain
And promised to each other that we'd always think the same
And dreamed that dream to be two souls as one
And stopped just as the sun set and waited for the night
Outside a glittering building of glittering glass and burning light

[Verse 2]
And in the road before us stood a weary, greyish man
Who held a child upon his back, a small boy by the hand
The three of them were dressed in rags and thinner than air
And all six eyes stared fixedly on you

[Chorus 1]
The father's eyes said, "Beautiful, how beautiful you are!"
The boy's eyes said "How beautiful, she shimmers like a star!"
The child's eyes uttered nothing but a mute and utter joy
And filled my heart with shame for us at the way we are
At the way we are

[Verse 3]
I turned to look at you, to read my thoughts upon your face
And gazed so deep into your eyes, so beautiful and strange
Until you spoke and showed me understanding is a dream
"I hate these people staring, make them go away from me!"

Title: A Strange Day
Release Date: May 4, 1982, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-a-strange-day-lyrics
Song Description: A Strange Day, a song about, according to Robert Smith, how I would feel if it would only be the end of the world, is backed by the same driving force that appeared on A Short Term Effect, only this time its slightly slower. The drums and prominent bassline are also reminiscent of the bands 1981 single, Charlotte Sometimes.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Give me your eyes that I might see
The blind man kissing my hands
The sun is humming, my head turns to dust
As he plays on his knees
(As he plays on his knees)

[Chorus]
And the sand and the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

[Verse 2]
And I laugh as I drift in the wind
Blind dancing on a beach of stone
Cherish the faces as they wait for the end
Sudden hush across the water
And we're here again

[Chorus]
And the sand and the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

Title: The Hanging Garden
Release Date: May 4, 1982, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-the-hanging-garden-lyrics
Song Description: The Hanging Garden was the sole commercial single release from The Cures album Pornography. Two releases of it were under the title A Single. It reached #34 in the UK, becoming their second-highest charting single there at the time  until the following year when The Walk broke the top 20.

Cure frontman Robert Smith said in a fanzine, The Hanging Garden is something like about the purity and hate of animals fucking. While its not very specific, thats all thats really known about the songs meaning. However, the title may be a reference to The Hanging Gardens in Mumbai, India, which is well known for its view of the Arabian Sea and its hedges, which are carved in the shapes of animals.



The lyrics to The Hanging Garden appeared in the original comic book The Crow. The group was asked if the song could be used in the 1994 film based on the comic, but Smith reportedly liked it so much he opted to write a new song for the soundtrack instead  Burn.
Lyrics:

Creatures kissing in the rain
Shapeless in the dark again
In the hanging garden, please don't speak
In the hanging garden, no one sleeps

Title: Faith
Release Date: April 14, 1981, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-faith-lyrics
Song Description: Smith told a fanzine in 1989 that the inspiration behind the title track to Faith is:

self explanatory, as optimistic as I could get, it does, or should, offer a note of HOPE.

In 2016, a Rolling Stone readers poll placed Faith as the #6 best Cure song of all time, above many better-known hits like Fascination Street and Boys Dont Cry. In the article, the writer shares that the song radiates with sorrow.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Catch me if I fall, I'm losing hold
I can't just carry on this way
And every time I turn away
I lose another blind game
The idea of perfection holds me

[Verse 2]
Suddenly, I see you change
Everything at once the same
But the mountain never moves
Rape me like a child, christened in blood
Painted like an unknown saint
There's nothing left but hope

[Verse 3]
Your voice is dead and old and always empty
Trust in me through closing years
Perfect moments wait
If only we could stay

[Verse 4]
Please say the right words
We cry like the stone white clown and stand
Lost forever in a happy crowd
No one lifts their hands, no one lifts their eyes
Justified with empty words
The party just gets better and better

That swims in a world of a magic show
It makes me bite my fingers through

Title: Fire in Cairo
Release Date: May 11, 1979, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-fire-in-cairo-lyrics
Song Description: This song describes a sexual daydream.

The hook and the name for the song allude to the Cairo Fire as a means of explaining how heated (sexy) the daydream was. The Cairo fire (or Black Saturday) was a series of anti-British riots on January 26, 1952 in downtown Cairo. Some 750 buildings were burned down.
Lyrics:

Slowly fading blue, the eastern hollows
Catch the dying sun, the night-time follows
Silence and black mirror pool

Song Description: The song is based off of a book of the same name, Charlotte Sometimes is one of Robert Smiths favourite books.
Robert Smith also says that it is the best single ever made by The Cure.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
All the faces, all the voices blur
Change to one face, change to one voice
Prepare yourself for bed
The light seems bright and glares on white walls
All the sounds of Charlotte Sometimes
Into the night with Charlotte Sometimes

[Verse 2]
Night after night, she lay alone in bed
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
Her eyes so open to the dark, the streets all looked so strange
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
They seemed so far away, but Charlotte did not cry
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)

[Pre-Chorus]
The people seemed so close to playing expressionless games
The people seemed so close, so many other names

[Chorus 1]
Sometimes I'm dreaming, where all the other people dance
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
Sometimes I'm dreaming, Charlotte Sometimes
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
Sometimes I'm dreaming
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
Expressionless the trance, sometimes I'm dreaming

So many different names
Sometimes I'm dreaming, the sounds all stay the same
Sometimes I'm dreaming
She hopes to open shadowed eyes on a different world
Come to me scared princess, Charlotte sometimes

[Verse 3]
On that bleak track, see the sun has gone again
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
The tears were pouring down her face
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
She was crying and crying for a girl
Who died so many years before
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)

[Chorus 2]
Sometimes I dream where all the other people dance
Sometimes I dream
Charlotte sometimes
Sometimes I dream, the sounds all stay the same
Sometimes I'm dreaming
There are so many different names
Sometimes I dream, sometimes I dream

[Outro]
Charlotte Sometimes, crying for herself (Charlotte Sometimes)
(Charlotte Sometimes)
Charlotte Sometimes dreams a wall around herself
(Charlotte Sometimes, Charlotte Sometimes)
But it's always with love, with so much love (Charlotte Sometimes)
It looks like everything else (Charlotte Sometimes)
Of Charlotte Sometimes, so far away (Charlotte Sometimes)
Glass sealed and pretty, Charlotte Sometimes

Title: Play for Today
Release Date: April 22, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-play-for-today-lyrics
Song Description: Play For Today was the second single from Seventeen Seconds. It was one of the earliest songs written for the album, completed before the previous album Three Imaginary Boys was released.

It was included on the CD release of the bands first singles collection Staring At The Sea, but not included on the cassette edition Standing On A Beach.

When Lol Tolhurst was asked which song got the best crowd reaction live, he responded:

Cure fans always sing along to the keyboard line of Play For Today, which is pretty wonderful to experience!
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It's not a case of doing what's right
It's just the way I feel that matters
Tell me I'm wrong, I don't really care
It's not a case of share and share alike
I take what I require
I don't understand, you say it's not fair

[Chorus]
You expect me to act like a lover
Consider my moves and deserve the reward
To hold you in my arms and wait, and wait
And wait for something to happen

[Verse 2]
It's not a case of telling the truth
Some lines just fit the situation
You call me a liar, you would anyway
It's not a case of aiming to please
You know you're always crying
It's just your part in the play for todayYou might also like9Embed

Title: A Short Term Effect
Release Date: May 4, 1982, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-a-short-term-effect-lyrics
Song Description: The second track on the Cures gothic milestone, Pornography, is centrally about the short term effect of drug-taking, something the band had been doing a lot of during the production of the album (and its predecessor, Faith), although, on another level, it deals with the same themes of the shortness and futility of life that are touched on on a number of Pornographys other tracks.

Sound-wise, it continues in the same vein as One Hundred Years, sustaining the already-intense atmosphere with a quick, driving drum pattern and screaming, backwards guitar noises. The major triad that opens the track also strikes an unsettling dissonance with the dark, whirring backing.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Movement, no movement, just a falling bird
Cold as it hits the bleeding ground
He lived and died, catch sight, cover me with earth
Draped in black, static white sound

[Chorus]
A day without substance, a change of thought
An atmosphere that rots with time
Colours that flicker in water, a short term effect

[Verse 2]
Scream as she tries to push him over
Helpless and sick
With teeth of madness, jump, jump, dance and sing
Sideways across the desert, a charcoal face bites my hand
Time is sweet, derange and disengage everything

[Chorus]
A day without substance, a change of thought
The atmosphere rots with time
Colours that flicker in water, a short term effect
A short term effect

[Outro]
An echo and a stranger's hand, a short term effect

Title: All Cats Are Grey
Release Date: April 14, 1981, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-all-cats-are-grey-lyrics
Song Description: The early demos being written for the bands third album Faith were upbeat, but one night Robert Smith wrote All Cats Are Grey (and The Funeral Party) and that really set the tone for the album, which ended up very somber.

In 1989, Smith explained the song is about being trapped in caves (and about growing old). This supports the claim from fans the song was inspired by Gormenghast novels where one of the characters lives in seclusion in caves. Lol Tolhurst shared in 2016 that All Cats Are Grey was written about his mothers death.

All cats are grey in the dark is a proverb that goes back as far the 16th century and professes that physical appearance is meaningless.

Founding member Lol Tolhursts mother Daphne, who was also the inspiration behind the content, told him she used to use the phrase all cats are grey.

Lyrics:

[Verse]
I never thought that I would find myself
In bed amongst the stones
The columns are all men begging to crush me
No shapes sail on the dark deep lakes
And no flags wave me home

In the caves, the texture coats my skin

This is stranger than I thought
Six different ways inside my heart
And every one I'll keep tonight
Six different ways go deep inside

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll tell them anything at all
I know I'll give them more and more

I know I'll give the world and more
They think I'm on my hands and head

Not one of you is the same"

Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I think too much of all that's gone
Of how it was before my thoughts
Obsessed with choices made for sure
In ignorance of history
And consequence as more and more
I misremember hopelessly

[Pre-Chorus]
The way love turned out every time
Was never quite enough

[Chorus]
I lose all my life like this
Reflecting time and memories
And all for fear of what I'll find
If I just stop and empty out my mind
Of all the ghosts and all the dreams
All I hold to in belief
That all I ever am
Is somehow never quite all I am now

The way love turns out every time
Will never be enough

[Chorus]
I waste all my world like this
Intending time and memories

If I just stop and empty out my mind
Of all the ghosts and all the dreams
All I hold to in belief

Title: Catch
Release Date: May 5, 1987, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-catch-lyrics
Song Description: Catch is the second single and second track from the Cures 1987 double album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. It is an immediate sign of the eclectic nature of the album, with its poppy, lightweight sound contrasting significantly with the epic, noisy opener.

It was not released as a single in the US, but reached #27 in the UK, and was a minor hit in Germany and The Netherlands.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Yes, I know who you remind me of
A girl I think I used to know
Yes, I'd see her when the day got colder
On those days when it felt like snow

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You know I even think that she stared like you
She used to just stand there and stare
And roll her eyes right up to heaven
And make like I just wasn't there

[Chorus]
And she used to fall down a lot
That girl was always falling again and again
And I used to sometimes try to catch her
But I never even caught her name

[Verse 2]
And sometimes we would spend the night
Just rolling about on a floor
And I remember even though it felt soft at the time
I always used to wake up sore

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You know I even think that she smiled like you
She used to just stand there and smile
And her eyes would go all sorts of far away
And stay like that for quite a while

Title: Open
Release Date: April 21, 1992, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-open-lyrics
Song Description: The opening track of Wish, appropriately titled Open, first saw release when a remix of the track was the b-side on select releases of the albums first single High.

In 1992, Rolling Stone described the track as:

a portrayal of one mans reflexive drinking done with a steady sway of drumming, interlocking guitars and Smiths all-out singing, which grows wilder and sicker as he clutches another glass. The chord changes in the chorus accentuate the state of mind of the protagonist, who keeps pouring it down.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I really don't know what I'm doing here
I really think I should've gone to bed tonight
But just one drink and there are some people to meet you
I think that you'll like them, I have to say, we do tonight
I promise in less than an hour, we will honestly go
Now why don't I just get you another
While you just say hello
Yeah, just say hello
Just say hello

[Verse 2]
So I'm clutching it tight, another glass in my hand
And my mouth and the smiles moving up as I stand up
Too close and too wide and the smiles are too bright
And I breathe in too deep and my head's getting light
But the air is getting heavier and it's closer
I'm starting to sway
And the hands all on my shoulders don't have names
And won't go away
So here I go
Here I go again

[Bridge 1]
Falling into strangers and it's only just eleven
I'm staring like a child until someone slips me Heaven
Take it on my knees just like a thousand times before
I get transfixed, that fixed
And I'm just looking at the floor
Just looking at the floor
Yeah, I look at the floor

I'm starting to laugh like an animal in pain
I've got blood on my hands, I've got hands in my brain
The first shot of retch leaves me gasping for more
I stagger over screaming on my way to the floor
And I'm back on my back
With the lights and the lies in my eyes
And the colour and the music's too loud
And my head's all the wrong size
So here I go, here I go again

[Bridge 2]
Yeah, I laugh and I jump, and I sing and I laugh
And I dance and I laugh, and I laugh and I laugh
And I can't seem to think where this is
Who I am, why I'm keeping this going
Keep pouring it out, keep pouring it down
Keeping it going, keep pouring it down
And the way the rain comes down hard
That's the way I feel inside

[Verse 4]
I can't take it anymore, this it I've become
This is it like I get when my life's going numb
I just keep moving my mouth, I just keep moving my feet
I say, "I'm loving you to death like I'm losing my breath"
And all the smiles that I wear and all the games that I play
And all the drinks that I mix and I drink until I'm sick
And all the faces I make and all the shapes that I throw
And all the people I meet and all the words that I know
Makes me sick to the heart, oh, I feel so tired
And the rain comes down hard
That's how I feel inside

And the rain comes down hard
That's how I feel inside
And the rain comes down hard
That's how I feel inside6Embed

Title: The Walk
Release Date: July 5, 1983, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-the-walk-lyrics
Song Description: The Walk is one of The Cures more obscure singles and deals with romance from the perspective of a dog.

Between 82 and '84, the so-called Three Imaginary Boys were finished with Pornography and began taking their sound to The Top.  In a manner of speaking, they were transforming as a band: the drummer started playing keys, the bassist left and came back, and Robert Smith extensively collaborated with Siouxsie and the Banshees. He and guitarist Steve Severin would release an album as The Glove in '83.

The song peaked at #12 in the UK, becoming their biggest hit at the time. It would soon be surpassed by their first top 10 The Lovecats just a few months later.

In 1993, Record Collector described The Walk as a head-on collision between the exaggerated 80s pop sound of Lets Go To Bed and the tumbling drums and morbid feel of The Hanging Garden.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I called you after midnight
Then ran until I burst
I passed the howling woman
And stood outside your door

[Verse 2]
We walked around the lake
And woke up in the rain
And everyone turned over
Troubled in their dreams again

[Verse 3]
Visiting time is over
And so we walk away
And both play dead then cry out loud
Why we always cry this way?

[Chorus]
I kissed you in the water
And made your dry lips sing
I saw you look like a Japanese baby
In an instant I remembered everything
Everything, everything, everything

Title: The Kiss
Release Date: May 5, 1987, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-the-kiss-lyrics
Song Description: The opener to The Cures seventh studio album, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, rushes forth with mighty guitar leads and banging drum rhythms, a nonstop thrill from the get go.

Smiths vocals march in after almost four minutes and sprout details of an individual attempting to stay buoyant in a relationship during times of hardship, conveyed when Smiths rants I never wanted any of this/I wish you were dead!

Though Smith knows this relationship is toxic for his own well-being, he still needs it in his life. He wants to be kissed, he wants to be loved.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental for 3min 50sec]

[Verse]
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Your tongue is like poison, so swollen it fills up my mouth
Just, just, love me, love me, love me
You nail me to the floor and push my guts all inside-out

Title: Primary
Release Date: April 14, 1981, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-primary-lyrics
Song Description: Primary was the lead single of Faith. It was the bands second charting single in the UK  almost their second top 40, peaking at #43. It also reached #29 in New Zealand.

In 1989, Smith expressed in a fanzine that with the lyrics of Primary, he was toying (?) with the idea that it may be better to die very young, innocent and dreamingor even to murder as a gift

In early live performances of the song, Smith would also dedicate the track to late singer of fellow English band Joy Division, Ian Curtis, following his unfortunate suicide.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
The innocence of sleeping children
Dressed in white and slowly dreaming stops all time
Slow my steps and start to blur, so many years have filled my heart
I never thought I'd say those words

[Chorus]
The further we go and older we grow
The more we know, the less we show
The further we go and older we grow
The more we know, the less we show

[Verse 2]
The very first time I saw your face
I thought of a song and quickly changed the tune
The very first time I touched your skin
I thought of a story and rushed to reach the end too soon

[Bridge]
Oh, remember
Oh, please don't change

[Verse 3]
So the fall came, thirteen years
A shiny ring and how I could forget your name
The air no longer in my throat, another perfect lie is choked
But it always feels the same

Song Description: Kyoto Song is the second track from The Cures 1985 album The Head on the Door. It features an oriental hook.

Robert Smith has stated that the inspiration was partially from a nightmare he had of his wife, Mary Poole, drowning. Some fans believe it was also inspired by a dream that either Smith or his wife had about cannibalism.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
A nightmare of you, of death in the pool
Wakes me up at quarter to three
I'm lying on the floor of the night before
With a stranger lying next to me

[Verse 2]
A nightmare of you, of death in the pool
I see no further now than this dream
The trembling hands of the trembling man
Hold my mouth to hold in a scream

[Verse 3]
I try to think, to make it slow
If only here is where I go
If this is real, I have to see
I turn on fire and next to me

[Chorus]
It looks good, it tastes like nothing on earth
It looks good, it tastes like nothing on earth
It's so smooth, it even feels like skin
It tells me how it feels to be new
It tells me how it feels to be new
A thousand voices whisper it true
It tells me how it feels to be new

In amongst the statues, stare at nothing, in the garden moves

Scared of what the morning brings
Waiting for tomorrow, never comes
Deep inside the empty feeling
All the night time leaves me
Three imaginary boys

Slipping through the door
Hear my heart beats in the hallway
Echoes 'round and 'round inside my head
Drifting up the stairs, I see the steps behind me disappearing
Can you help me?

Close my eyes and hold so tightly
Scared of what the morning brings
Waiting for tomorrow, never comes
Deep inside the empty feeling
All the night time leaves me

Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Oh, it's misery the way we fight
For bitter ends we tear the night in two
I want your death, you want my life
We tell each other lies to hide the truth
And we hate ourselves for everything we do
Is shame wounded pride, vengeful anger burning deep inside
Poison in our blood and pain, broken dreams, mournful hopes
For all we might have been, all misunderstood

[Chorus]
But no way out of this
No way for us to find a way to peace
We never found before
However we regret
All we will ever know
Is bitter ends
For we are born to war

[Bridge]
For we are born to war

[Outro]
However we regret
All we will ever know
Is bitter ends

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It's a perfect day for letting go
For setting fire to bridges, boats
And other dreary worlds you know
And let's get happy!
It's a perfect day for making out
To wake up with a smile without a doubt
To burst, grin, giggle, bliss, skip, jump, sing and shout
Let's get happy!

[Chorus]
"But it's much too late" you say, "for doing this now
We should have done it then," well it just goes to show
How wrong you can be and how you really should know
That it's never too late
To get up and go

[Verse 2]
It's a perfect day for kiss and swell
Rip-zipping, button-popping kiss and well
There's loads of other stuff can make you yell
Let's get happy!
It's a perfect day for doing the unstuck
For dancing like you can't hear the beat
And you don't give a further thought
To things like feet
Let's get happy!

And kiss it all goodbye!

Lyrics:

Memories of children's dreams
Lie lifeless, fading lifeless
Hand in hand with fear and shadows

Title: Hot Hot Hot!!!
Release Date: May 5, 1987, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-hot-hot-hot-lyrics
Song Description: Hot Hot Hot!!! is the 11th track (3rd of Side C) on the Cures 1987 album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. It was released as its fourth and final single in February 1988. The single includes the track Hey You!!, which, at the time, was left off of the original CD releases of Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me due to the time constraints of the medium.

It found moderate success in the UK (#45) and the US (#65), but  did best in Spain, reaching the top 10 there.

Since its release, the song has been criticized by some for its dance-funk sound sounding dated, as well as its lyrics and Robert Smiths vocal performance.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
She may be the face I can't forget

[Verse 1]
The first time I saw lightning strike, I saw it underground
Six deep feet below the street, the sky came crashing down
For a second that place was lost in space
Then everything went black
I left that basement burning and I never went back

[Verse 2]
The second time I saw it strike, I saw it at sea
It lit up all the fish like rain and rained them down on me
For a second that boat was still afloat
Then everything went black
I left it underwater and I never went back

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, but I like it when that lightning comes
Hey, hey, hey, yes, I like it a lot
Hey, hey, hey, yes, I'm jumping like a jumping jack
I'm dancing, screaming, itching, squealing, fevered
Feeling hot, hot, hot

[Verse 3]
The third time I saw lightning strike, it hit me in bed
It threw me around and left me for dead
For a second that room was on the moon
Then everything went black
I left that house on fire and I never went back

Song Description: NMEs Andrew Trendell called Drone:Nodrone:

A wailing, noir rocker with a devious earworm chorus that feels like the impish cousin of One Hundred Years, Burn and Killing An Arab.

One week before the release of Songs Of A Lost World, the band offered a short clip of the song to fans via their WhatsApp account.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'm breaking up again, I feel it in the air
I'm really not sure what to say
I don't remember being there at all
Yeah, I know, there's no question that I was
But the answers that I have
Are not the answers that you want

[Chorus]
So it's all, "Don't know, I really don't"
And all, "Think so, but maybe not"
And all, "Could be a case of me misplacing my identity?"
Yeah, all, "Don't know, I really don't"
And all, "Think so, but maybe not"
And all, "I guess it's more or less like ending up as nobody?"

[Post-Chorus]
Down, down, down, yeah, I'm pretty much done
Staring down the barrel of the same warm gun
Down, down, down
Yeah, I'm prеtty much done
I lose my reason whеn I fall through the door
Endless black night lost in looking for more
At least I know now how I lose it before

So it's all, "Don't know, I really don't"
And all, "Think so, but maybe not"
And all, "Could be a case of me displacing my reality?"
And all, "I guess it's more or less the way that it was meant to be"

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
So, we meet again and I offer my hand
All dry and English slow
And you look at me and I understand
Yeah, it's a look I used to know
Three long years and your favorite man
Is that any way to say hello?
And you hold me like you'll never let me go
Like you'll never let me go

[Verse 2]
Oh, come on and have a drink with me
Sit down and talk a while
Oh, I wish I could and I will
But now I just don't have the time
And over my shoulder as I walk away
I see you give that look-goodbye
I still see that look in your eye

[Chorus 1]
So dizzy, Mr. Busy, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the silly, frilly things have to first get done

But chilly, Mr. Dilly, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the tizzy, fizzy, idiot things must get done
In a second, just hang on, all in good time
Won't be long until later

I should've stopped to think, I should've made the time
I could've had that drink, I could've talked a while
I would've done it right, I would've moved us on

Hear the bells across the sea

Shadows growing closer now
There is nowhere left to hide
I can't wake this dream to sleep
However hard I try
Down on my knees
Aching inside
Something wicked this way comes
From out the cool November night
Something wicked this way comes
To steal away my brother's life

The games they tired of yesterday

Title: At Night
Release Date: April 22, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-at-night-lyrics
Song Description: This song is an interpretation of Franz Kafkas very short story At Night, as frontman Robert Smith mentioned in Q&A in the Cure News #6 fanzine from 1989:

inspired by the kafka short story of the same name  the precursor to faith

In Kafkas version, the narrator refers to you as one of the watchmen, after describing a scene in which all around people are asleep in safe beds, under a safe roof.

In The Cures version, Robert Smith assumes the role as one of the watchmen, and mutters to himself during a streak of existential clarity.

Someone must watch, it is said.  Someone must be there.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Sunk deep in the night, I sink in the night
Standing alone underneath the sky
I feel the chill of ice on my face
I watch the hours go by
The hours go by

[Verse 2]
You sleep, sleep in a safe bed
Curled and protected, protected from sight
Under a safe roof, deep in your house
Unaware of the changes at night
At night

[Verse 3]
I hear the darkness breathe
I sense the quiet despair
Listen to the silence at night
Someone has to be there
Someone has to be there

No, I won't do it again, I don't want to pretend
If it can't be like before, I've got to let it end
I don't want what I was, I had a change of head
But maybe someday
Yeah, maybe someday

[Verse 2]
I've got to let it go and leave it gone
Just walk away, stop it going on
Get too scared to jump if I wait too long
But maybe someday, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll see you smile as you call my name
And start to feel and it feels the same
And I know that maybe someday's come
Maybe someday's come again

[Refrain]
So tell me someday's come
Tell me someday come again

[Verse 3]
No, I won't do it some more, it doesn't make any sense
If we can't be like it was, I've got to let it rest
I don't want what I did, I had a change of tense
But maybe someday, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
I'll see you smile as you call my name
And start to feel and it feels the same
And I know that maybe someday's come
Maybe someday's come again

[Bridge]
If I could do it again, maybe just once more
Think I could make it work like I did it before
If I could try it out, if I could just be sure
That maybe someday is the last time

[Outro]
Yeah, maybe someday is the end
Or maybe someday is when it all stops
Or maybe someday always comes again2Embed

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
When we look back at it all as I know we will
You and me wide-eyed
I wonder will we really remember
How it feels to be this alive?

[Chorus]
And I know we have to go, I realize
We only get to stay so long
Always have to go back to real lives
Where we belong

[Post-Chorus]
Where we belong
Where we belong

[Verse 2]
When we think back to all this and I'm sure we will
Me and you here and now
Will we forget the way it really is?
Why it feels like this and how?

[Chorus]
And we always have to go, I realize
We always have to say goodbye
Always have to go back to real lives
But real lives are the reason why
We want to live another life
We want to feel another time
Another time
Another time

But real lives are why we stay
For another dream, another day
For another world, for another way, for another way

Title: The Blood
Release Date: August 26, 1985, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-the-blood-lyrics
Song Description: The Blood was inspired by a Portuguese wine named Tears Of Christ (Smith changed it to blood of Christ using poetic license). He told NME in 1985:

Its a very cheap Portuguese wine, its a very heavy drink that all the workers drink its about 12p a bottle. I was given a bottle of it and I drank it, and I noticed the label, which is the Virgin Mary with Baby Jesus under one arm and a bottle in the other hand. It was completely brilliant. [] I was convinced I was Portuguese, I just sank into this reverie of being a Portuguese flamenco guitarist.

The song was released as a promotional single in Spain only. It did not chart there.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Tell me who doesn't love what can never come back?
You can never forget how it used to feel
The illusion is deep, it's as deep as the night
I can tell by your tears you remember it all

[Chorus]
I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes, I can never stop
Never stop

[Verse 2]
How it feels to be dry, walking bare in the sun
Every mirage I see is a mirage of you
As I cool in the twilight, taste the salt on my skin
I recall all the tears, all the broken words

[Chorus]
I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes, I can never stop
Never stop

[Bridge]
When the sunset's glow drifts away from you
You'll no longer know if any of this was really true at all

Lyrics:

Don't worry, I smile
I’ll miss you, but it's not like you're gone
Don’t worry, I smile
It's not like there won't be another one
We laughed about last year
The games we played, the songs we sang
The way we danced all night
Don't worry, I smile
We'll do all those things again next time

And I kiss you
So soft, so cold, so pale
The words are left unsaid
But we know, we always know
I can sing, I can dance, I can laugh
As if nothing ever changed
But without you, without you
It can never be the same
It can never be the same
It can never be the same
It can never be the same

Don't worry, I smile
I'll miss you, but it's not like you’re gone
Don’t worry, I smile
It's not like there won’t be another one
There won't be another one
However long I wait
There won't be another one
It will always be too late
There won't be another one
We won’t do it all again
There won't be another one
Without you
It can never be the same

Title: The Drowning Man
Release Date: April 14, 1981, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-the-drowning-man-lyrics
Song Description: According to Smith, The Drowning Man was based on the Gormenghast books by Mervyn Peake. The character Fuchsia is perched on a windowsill after learning her lover is responsible for killing her father when a knock on the door startles her into banging her head on the ledge, falling from the window and then drowning.

The studio version was recorded in a way that it (often) doesnt allow you to take a breath between verses (like drowning).

In 2018, Smith released a remix he personally made of The Drowning Man on the collection Torn Down.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
She stands twelve feet above the flood
She stares, alone across the water
The loneliness grows and slowly
Fills her frozen body, sliding downwards
One by one her senses die
The memories fade and leave her eyes
Still seeing worlds that never were
And one by one, the bright birds leave her

[Verse 2]
Starting at the violent sound
She tries to turn, but final, noiseless
Slips and strikes her soft dark head
The water bows, receives her
And drowns her at its ease
And drowns her at its ease

[Bridge]
I would have left the world all bleeding
Could I only help you, love
The fleeting shapes, so many years ago
So young and beautiful and brave
Everything was true, it couldn't be a story
I wish it was all true, I wish it couldn't be a story
The words all left me lifeless, hoping
Breathing like the drowning man
Oh, Fuchsia, you leave me breathing like the drowning man

Title: Other Voices
Release Date: April 14, 1981, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-other-voices-lyrics
Song Description: A promotional music video was made for Other Voices but the song was not released as a single. When Smith was asked what his inspiration for the song was for a fanzine in 1989, he replied:

this ones a bit difficultumm blotting out the world through the eating of forbidden fruit? deafened by lust?

Other Voices was included on the 1986 CD compilation Staring At The Sea, but not on the cassette edition titled Standing On A Beach  as it had fewer album tracks included on it (Play For Today and A Night Like This are two more examples of songs only included on the CD release).
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Whisper your name in an empty room
You brush past my skin, as soft as fur
Taking hold, I taste your scent
Distant noises, other voices

[Chorus 1]
Pounding in my broken head
Commit the sin, commit yourself
And all the other voices said
Change your mind, you're always wrong

[Refrain]
Always wrong
Always wrong

[Verse 3]
Come around at Christmas, I really have to see you
Smile at me slyly, another festive compromise
But I live with desertion and eight million people

Caress the sound, so many dead
And all the other voices sing

Title: Cut
Release Date: April 21, 1992, URL: https://genius.com/The-cure-cut-lyrics
Song Description: Cut is sung from the point of view of someone who still loves someone that once loved him and doesnt anymore. It pains him to see her because it isnt the same anymore, yet he still feels hopelessly drawn to her. Its a fast and furious rock track with a similar feel to 1987s Shiver and Shake, featuring busy drums and wildly flanging guitar.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
If only you'd never speak to me
The way that you do
If only you'd never speak like that
It's like listening to
A breaking heart, falling sky
Fire go out and friendship die
I wish you felt the way that I still do
The way that I still do

[Verse 2]
If only you'd never look at me
The way that you do
If only you'd never look like that
When I look at you
I see face like stone, eyes of ice
Mouth so sweetly telling lies
I wish you felt the way that I still do
The way that I still do

But you don't
You don't feel anymore

Song Description: This song is about a girl whos being stalked by someone in the subway. The screams most likely indicate she gets caught by whatever is stalking her. The fact that she gets caught by it is pretty disturbing. It is based on a story Robert smith would tell people that he know someone who was murdered on a subway, he also said that it was completely false and he made it up to scare people.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Midnight in the subway, she's on her way home

Echoes of footsteps follow close behind
But she dare not turn around

Song Description: According to an article in the Record Mirror dated April 7, 1979, So What was originally going to be titled Cheap Sex. Other lyrics had been written for it, but when Robert Smith was tiring of recording one day, he strutted into the studio, clutching a sugar bag in one hand, and proceeded to verbalize straight from the ingredients thereon.

Song Description: Robert Smith cryptically shared in a fanzine that Three was written about the eternal triangle.

During their 1981 tour in support of their next album Faith, the band sometimes closed with a jam made up on the spot based on this song to relieve the tensions of the day. Once it lasted 45 minutes!
Lyrics:

Enough of that "stand up straight"
What nonsense
"No," I said, my face close to the ground, "I'll stay as I am."
"You really can annoy a person, I must say. Such a waste of time! Come on, put an end to it."

"The way you shout! In the quiet of the night!" I said
"Just as you like," he added

But wheeling suddenly around, he looked at me - I hadn't quite finished yet - and said: "What's this? You're all crooked! What on earth are you up to?"

"Quite right. You're very observant," said I, my head on the seam of his trousers, which was why I couldn't look up properly
I won't scream, I'll just stare at him as long as my eyes can stand it
