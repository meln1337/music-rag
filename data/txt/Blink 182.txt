Artist: Blink 182
Artist Description: blink-182 set off the 1990s storm of pop-punk, blazing a trail in the genre with electrifying riffs and memorable lines—“Fuck a Dog,” anyone? The band has seen some lineup changes over the years, but its core trio (Tom DeLonge, Mark Hoppus, and Travis Barker) has mostly stood the test of time. In 2015, DeLonge left the band to pursue other projects. As of 2022, DeLonge has returned.

Founded in 1992 in Poway, California (a suburb in San Diego), DeLonge, Hoppus, and former drummer Scott Raynor formed the band in Raynor’s bedroom, writing songs for their demos, and playing practical jokes along the way. Initially, under the name Blink, the trio was forced to change the name to avoid a lawsuit with the Irish pop-rock group of the same name, so they added “182” at random (fans continue to speculate what “182” means to this day).

After releasing their demo album Buddha, blink-182 released Cheshire Cat in 1995 under Cargo Records. While not a major success at the time, the album generated buzz from the Southern California punk scene and major labels alike. After being signed to MCA Records, the band released Dude Ranch in 1997 with the hit singles “Dammit” and “Josie”.

In 1998, Scott Raynor was removed for his drinking addiction, which affected the band’s performance and created tensions for the trio. Travis Barker, formerly of The Aquabats, filled in for Raynor during the West Coast mini-tour, and was quickly welcomed as a permanent drummer. His drumming technique heavily influenced the band, causing a sonic shift in their songwriting. With the aid of their new producer Jerry Finn, blink-182 went on to record their next album.

Enema of the State (1999) was the band’s first enormous commercial success, selling over 15 million copies worldwide on the strength of singles “What’s My Age Again?”, “All the Small Things,” and “Adam’s Song.” Their 2001 release, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, peaked at #1 on U.S. Billboard and introduced the world to the catchy “First Date.” A 2003 self-titled album saw a stylistic shift in the band’s music, marked by fatherhood and maturity in songs like “I Miss You” and “Down”.

The band went on a four-year hiatus from 2005 to 2009. DeLonge focused on Angels & Airwaves (with elements taken from Box Car Racer), Hoppus fronted +44 with Barker, who also worked on solo drum work and collaborated with the late DJ AM. After the band’s reunion in 2009 following Barker’s plane crash, they released Neighborhoods to critical acclaim in 2011, although the album left mixed feelings in the divided fanbase.

Upon DeLonge’s departure from the band in 2015, Alkaline Trio frontman Matt Skiba was announced as his replacement. The new lineup returned to the studio in August of 2015 to record their long-awaited seventh album, California, which released on July 1, 2016.

Their eighth album, titled NINE hit the world with the singles, “Blame It On My Youth”, “Generational Divide”, “Happy Days”, “Darkside”, and “I Really Wish I Hated You” in 2019. This was the last full album with Skiba, who left in 2022 upon DeLonge’s return.

Their album One More Time…, released on October 20, 2023, is their first album with Tom DeLonge since Neighborhoods.

Title: I Miss You
Release Date: November 18, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-i-miss-you-lyrics
Song Description: I Miss You is one of Blink-182s most iconic tracks, serving as a haunting depiction of the effect depression can have on a relationship and its subsequent fallout.

The song I Miss You delves into the haunting nature of longing and loss, exploring themes of nostalgia, emotional turmoil, and the inescapable presence of a past love that lingers in the mind like a persistent shadow. It portrays the struggle to cope with the absence of a significant other and the pervasive feeling of melancholy that accompanies memories of a once-intimate connection.

Chart wise, it peaked at #1 on Billboards Alternative Songs and was certified Gold by RIAA.

The song was produced entirely acoustically and features an upright bass, cello, and brushes on the drums. The track is also the only blink-182 track to-date in which Travis uses brushes instead of drumsticks.

Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus wrote the song in a two-part way, combining two songs together to make this track. The song was inspired by The Cures song The Lovecats and contains a reference to the film The Nightmare Before Christmas.

The track went on to inspire The Chainsmokers Closer.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

Title: All the Small Things
Release Date: June 1, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-all-the-small-things-lyrics
Song Description: Blink-182 founder Tom DeLonge wrote this song with bassist/singer Mark Hoppus. DeLonge wrote this song about his then-girlfriend and eventual wife, Jenna Jenkins. His anecdoteslike the one about her leaving flowers on the stairs, are actually true. In a Rolling Stone profile from the year this song came out, Hoppus said:

Tom is totally, 100 percent faithful to his girlfriend. Hes pretty straightforward: He hangs out with his girlfriend, and he believes in aliens.

It was the last song the pop punk trio recorded for their third album Enema of the State and was one of three singles from the album that launched them into mainstream success. That album would remain their most successful album to date.

DeLonge began this song with a guitar riff and wanted to make a song with a lot of na na nas, a homage to his punk idols, the Ramones. He told Kerrang!:

Because it was so simple, it wasnt so much fun to play. But once we put it all together, and played it as a band, we all looked at each other and said, This songs huge!

The video for this song is a parody of the Backstreet Boys video for I Want It That Way. Mark Hoppus met his wife, Skye Everly, an MTV executive, on the set of the video shoot.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting

Title: What’s My Age Again?
Release Date: April 13, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-whats-my-age-again-lyrics
Song Description: Arguably one of the greatest pop-punk anthems and one of the most popular blink-182 songs. Whats My Age Again? was written by Mark Hoppus and was inspired by the fact that he was often pointed out as immature. The original title was Peter Pan Complex, but their record company (MCA) changed it, believing people wouldnt understand its meaning.

The song follows a character (most probably Mark Hoppus himself) who is 23 years old but still acts like a child. He pulls up pranks and jokes that annoy people and is left wondering if he is portraying his real age. He finally concludes that he shouldnt care what people think of him and continues his childish ways.

Mark Hoppus has confirmed that Green Day inspired the opening riff of the Blink-182 song Whats My Age Again?.

This was revealed by the bassist Blink-182 on the Chris DeMakes podcast from the band Less Than Jake.


Theres a Green Day song called J.A.R. on the [1995 film] Angus soundtrack, and it starts off with this bass intro thats really rad,

I was messing around on the guitar trying to learn that. I kinda messed up the progression and I played it incorrectly, and I was like: Oh, thats kinda cool

That was the basis for the opening riff of [Whats My Age Again?]: me trying to learn how to play J.A.R. on guitar and messing it up, and coming up with something that I liked that was different than that.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feelin' right
We started makin' out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]

My friends say I should act my age
(What's my age again?)
(What's my age again?)
That's about the time that she broke up with me
(Please stay with me)
No one should take themselves so seriously
(Please stay with me)
With many years ahead to fall in line
(Please stay with me)
Why would you wish that on me?
(Please stay) I never wanna act my age
(With) What's my age again?
(Me) What's my age again?

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]

Title: Adam’s Song
Release Date: June 1, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-adams-song-lyrics
Song Description: A popular song by Blink-182 describing a young boys suicide note. Its a break from their usual light-hearted material, but the end is still life affirming as he decides not to go through with it.

Adam is used as a metaphor towards Marks depression he experienced while on tour with Blink-182. He stated:

Tom and Travis always had girlfriends waiting back home, so they had something to look forward to at the end of the tour. But I didnt, so it was always like, I was lonely on tour, but then I got home and it didnt matter because there was nothing there for me anyway.

Adams Song is also commonly attributed to the urban myth of Adam Krieger, a fictional character whose suicide letter is falsely portrayed as being the original letter that the band received before writing the song. This fake suicide letter, that is often posted online via places like tumblr, is fictitional and was originally written for a play.

The songs title is also a reference to a skit from the cult classic HBO sketch show, Mr. Show With Bob and David, where in the sketch a band called Titanica writes a song called Try Again (Adams Song) with the intent of encouraging a fan to kill himself so they wont be able to take him on tour after said fan tried to kill himself after hearing their song Try Suicide.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault

To pass the time in my room alone

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
And I can't wait 'til I get home

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Strangers, from strangers into brothers
From brothers into strangers once again
We saw the whole world, but I couldn't see the meaning
I couldn't even recognize my friends

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Older, but nothing's any different
Right now feels the same, I wonder why
I wish they told us, it shouldn't take a sickness
Or airplanes falling out the sky

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Do I have to die to hear you miss me?
Do I have to die to hear you say goodbye?
I don't wanna act like there's tomorrow
I don't wanna wait to do this one more time

One morе time
One more
Onе more time
One more time

[Verse 3: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]

Title: Feeling This
Release Date: October 2, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-feeling-this-lyrics
Song Description: Revolving around the themes of lust and love, Feeling This is an enthusiastic pop-punk anthem that narrates the sexual adventures of a couple while at the same time showing the passionate side of the encounter.

For the writing of this song, Tom and Mark had the idea of getting into two different rooms to write lyrics. Tom wrote (the verses) about the physicality of sex while Mark wrote (the chorus) about the passionate side. When combined, they gave us Feeling This.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Get ready for action!

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
I got no regret right now (I'm feelin' this!)
The air is so cold and low (I'm feelin' this!)
Let me go in her room (I'm feelin' this!)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way you move (I'm feelin' this!)
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feelin' this!)
I love all the things you do (I'm feelin' this!)

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feelin' this!)
Our breathing's got too loud (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feelin' this!)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feelin' this!)
Take me away from here (I'm feelin' this!)

I'll leave when I wanna

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus]
This place was never the same again after you came and went
How could you say you meant anything
Different to anyone standing alone on the
Street with a cigarette on the first night we met
Look to the past and remember and smile
And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
I'm not in this scene, I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you

[Outro Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, Both]

Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It's alright to tell me what you think about me
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons
The season is calling, your pictures are falling down

[Verse 2]
The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
The timing and structure, did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short, I'm writing the report
On losing and failing, when I move, I'm flailing now

[Chorus]
And it's happened once again, I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands, and sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone, and I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well, I guess this is growing up

[Refrain]
Well, I guess this is growing up

[Verse 3]
And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last, when he's gone, I won't come back

Release Date: October 8, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-first-date-lyrics
Song Description: As the title suggests, this song is about two peoples first date together. One of them is self-conscious and nervous about what the other thinks, but enjoys the excitement and wishes to savor the night for as long as possible.

The songs music video takes place in the 1970s and features the band members in character dressed in stereotypical 70s fashion, driving around in a Volkswagen van, and having a good time, often at the expense of others. The video parodies and pays homage to the pop group The Bee Gees and the 1993 comedy Dazed and Confused, which follows high-schoolers in 1976. It also features cameos from fellow pop-punkers Jordan Pundik and Chad Gilbert of New Found Glory.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
In the car, I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous, so I really can't eat

[Chorus]
Let's go, don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever

[Verse 2]
When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

The thing you realize as you get older is that parents dont know what the hell theyre doing and neither will you when you get to be a parent. Youve just got to understand that people are human and they make mistakes.

Mark Hoppus

When I got home [one] day, my dads furniture was gone, my mom was inside crying and everything just erupted at that point. I was 18, sitting in my driveway when it all went down. My whole family life was deteriorating, so, I just moved out. So I just took everything from that day and put it into a song.

Tom DeLonge

The songs unreleased original music video featured a wrecking ball, being a metaphor for divorce, crashing into and destroying a home. In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the band and label decided to re-shoot it, removing any similarities to the attacks. The original video is available on YouTube here.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home?
I'd read it every day

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?

[Post-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
It's not right...

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants, and it's what she wants
Then why's there so much pain?

Title: Always
Release Date: November 1, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-always-lyrics
Song Description: The fourth single from their 5th (self-titled) album, Always is a track centered around the longing for an old relationship, with the taste and smell once so synonymous with happiness causing desperation.

The band categorize it as a love song, and claim that its influenced heavily by the 1980s sound.

Its got kind of an 80s thing. Its not a dance song, but if you were to dance to it, youd look like you were right out of 85

The music video is a trippy mix of 3 separate screens, stacked on top of each other, all showing a part of a solid narrative at slightly different times, giving it a cartoonish quality. It tells the story of 3 guys dating the same girl.

The song barely charted worldwide, and was much more popular as a music video, racking up millions of views on YouTube.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
And your hands, they shake with goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you, all night, always

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
And I'll miss your laugh, your smile
I'll admit I'm wrong if you tell me
I'm so sick of fights, I hate them
Let's start this again, for real

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?
So here I am, I'm trying

Title: Bored to Death
Release Date: April 27, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-bored-to-death-lyrics
Song Description: Bored To Death is the first single from Blink-182s 2016 album, California, and the first to feature Matt Skiba, who replaced long-time guitarist Tom DeLonge in 2015.

Producer John Feldy Feldmann had more to say in this article:


Bored to Death was the first song we did together. My idea for the song was very much, lets throw everything and the kitchen sink at it. Lets do everything I can think of that reminds me of classic Blink: the guitar riffs, the kind of hip-hop/drum and bass songs, the half-time choruses like in Stay Together For The Kids, I had all these ideas and we threw them into one song with a classic Mark Hoppus lyric.

The bridge is what I think made it turn into the single, when Mark came up with that nursery-rhyme bridge section, melodically and lyrically. I knew it was special but it wasnt until we had the record donesongs like Sober and Shes Out of Her Mind those songs might be more classically singles but this song just feels like a unique, different, exciting [single.] When I listen to KROQ and it comes on, it just feels good.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I...
I'm not coming home

[Chorus: Matt Skiba and Mark Hoppus]
Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Skiba]
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I...
I'm not coming home

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
I said, "I'm sorry I'm a bit of a let down"
But all my friends are daring me to come over
So I come over and over and over
So let me buy you a drink, and we'll pretend that you think
That I'm the man of your dreams come to life in a dive bar
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over

Title: She’s Out of Her Mind
Release Date: July 1, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-shes-out-of-her-mind-lyrics
Song Description: The third track off of California shows the narrators admiration for a woman who might not be 100% normal, saying she wears dark clothes and listens to gothic music. But, shes still an angel to him!

Heres what California producer John Feldmann had to say about the song:


Skiba came up with the Bauhaus lyric and we were talking about thatHow many Blink fans are going to even know who Bauhaus is? At the end we decided Who gives a fuck? and did what we want. Its a fun line! It was song originally called Orange County Girl. Marks wife is from Orange County. We wanted to write a classic, no-brainer pop-punk song: major key, fun, happy, classic. We wrote that one pretty early on. It kind of got shelved because it felt too happy compared to the rest of the record.

Travis really drove a couple of these songs home. He came back to this one and said, Dude, we cannot leave this song off the record. Its too important for the Take Off Your Pants & Jacket-era of Blink. Theres no drama. Theres no heaviness to it. Its about this girl who is a little bit out of her mind but we love her.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I said, "Settle down, settle down, everything is fine
Take your eyes off the floor"
She said, "No, I'm not, no, I'm not, no, I'm not alright
I lost my head on the door"

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
She's a-a-a-antisocial, a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-and she's an angel, yeah

[Chorus: Matt Skiba and Mark Hoppus]
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
She said "Babe, I'm sorry, but I'm crazy tonight"
She got a black shirt, black skirt, and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]
We all need something to live for, oh yeah
We all need something to live for

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
She said, "I let her down, let her down, I no longer dream
Of anything anymore"
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all, "You make me want to scream"

Title: Dumpweed
Release Date: June 1, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-dumpweed-lyrics
Song Description: The first track off Enema of the State, Dumpweed is a classic song about staying in a relationship because youre too afraid of what will happen if youre on your own without this person. In the TV show Pursuit of Tone, Tom explains how he wrote the riffs to this song.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared to stay
I said I'd leave, I could never leave her
If I did, you know I'd never cheat her
But this, I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel if I should choose to go?
Another guy, you think he'd be unlike me?
Another guy, you think he'd wanna fight me?

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
I heard it once, I'm sure I've heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say, "You've got to turn your back and run, now"
"Come on, son, you haven't got a chance now"

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play

Title: Fuck a Dog
Release Date: June 12, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-fuck-a-dog-lyrics
Song Description: Fuck a Dog is one of the three bonus joke tracks released on blink-182s 2001 album Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. It was released on the Yellow Pants version of the album along with B-side What Went Wrong. It serves as an outro to this version of the album and its one of the most iconic examples of the bands cheeky humor.

Blink wrote this song and When You Fucked Grandpa as a symbolic big middle finger to MCA Records. They noted an immense pressure from MCA to write a carbon copy of Enema of the State, so they decided to play a prank on them as Tom DeLonge detailed in 2012 for Music Radar:

I remember the label came down to hear the big follow-up and those were the only songs [Fuck a Dog and When You Fucked Grandpa] we played them. Oh my God, they lost their minds. We had this song about fucking Hitler  we changed it to When you fucked grandpa, but it originally was, When you fucked Hitler did he tell you that he loved you? They lost it.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
I wanna fuck a dog in the ass, he wants to
Fuck a dog in the ass, I wanna fuck a dog, that's right kids
I tried to fuck your mom in the ass, tried to fuck your dad in the ass
Could only find the dog and his ass

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
We wanna fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna
Fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna fuck a dog

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
I tried to fuck a fucking pirate in the ass, arr, me and me
First mate, ya scurvy cur! Tried to fuck a fucking pirate
But I found the dog, arr, that was no pirate, man
That was thy own sister! (It's a Mexican pirate)

[Chorus Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
We wanna fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna
Fuck a dog in the ass, wanna fuck a fucking dog

Title: Dysentery Gary
Release Date: June 1, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-dysentery-gary-lyrics
Song Description: According to Tom DeLonges annotation, Dysentery Gary was written from the perspective of someone dealing with unrequited love. The song captures the frustration of liking a girl who is interested in another guy, with the narrators irrational hatred directed towards this rival. Even though the narrator cant pinpoint a specific reason for his animosity, the song reflects his sense of helplessness and bitterness. To cope with his heartbreak, he resorts to making fun of the other guy.

The songs themes include unrequited love and frustration, highlighting the emotional pain of unreturned feelings and the narrators jealousy. The use of exaggerated and absurd imagery, like dysentery and diarrhea giver, underscores the irrationality of his feelings and provides a humorous take on his heartache. Tom DeLonges vocal delivery blends sarcasm with frustration, while the lyrics' absurd elements, such as the mention of trying on fathers tights, add to the songs comedic edge.



Dysentery is an infection that gives you violent, bloody diarrhea. This fuckboy Gary is giving a bunch of girls dysentery by hooking up with them, probably disgusting them during their, um, interactions.

Tom also addresses every guys biggest problem with girls: they always pick the popular douchebag over the nice, polite guys. Tom is better than this low-life Gary guy but sadly, hell never win. He comes to terms that sometimes life just screws us over, even calling Garys mom a whore. Classic Blink 182 humor.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Got a lotta heartache, he's a fuckin' weasel
His issues make my mind ache, wanna make a deal
'Cause I love your little motions you do with your pigtails
What a nice creation, worth another night in jail

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out, friends were listening to Slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with Mom and trying on his father's tights

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Life just sucks, I lost the one
I'm giving up, she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
So all you little ladies, be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe, I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heartache, he's a fucking weasel
Decisions make my mind ache, wanna make a deal

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus]
Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl will choose the guy that makes you wanna kick and scream
All along, you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy that took her and ran away, and

Title: The Rock Show
Release Date: June 25, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-the-rock-show-lyrics
Song Description: The Rock Show explores the thoughts and behavior of a teenage punk-rocker who goes to the Vans Warped Tour, and subsequently falls in love with a girl there.

The first single off of Blink-182s 2001 album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, the song was reportedly one of the last two songs written for the albumthe other being First Dateand was written in just one night by bassist/vocalist Mark Hoppus. Allegedly, the song was brought into creation after a record executive listened to a demo of the album and claimed that the record company would want a song or two that they could package as a single. Upon hearing this, both guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge and Hoppus separately wrote the most throwaway singles they could think of.

The songs music video follows Blink after receiving a $500,000 budget to create the video. The band members then proceed to give several hand-outs, pay strangers to do bizarre things, release doves, film skate tricks, and destroy a brand new car and television.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it, I swear

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window

[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

Title: I Really Wish I Hated You
Release Date: September 6, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-i-really-wish-i-hated-you-lyrics
Song Description: I Really Wish I Hated You was one of the toughest songs to write for this record according to Mark and Matt. The song went through almost 5 different iterations which made Matt jokingly named it I Really Wish You Never Wrote That. The song tells a story of regret, of how someone wants to get back together with someone else but knows he shouldnt.

The song was originally a really soft song, but in one of those re-writings, the band pushed the pedal to the metal nevertheless, they didnt like it either and fell back to a middle ground to a more middle of the road sound.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
’Cause I don't really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
A little drunk, waiting on your phone call
A little numb, maybe I can't feel at all
You stitch me up but you can’t stop me bleeding out
I'm better when I'm broken

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
I love you, but I hate you when you're with someone else
And I want you wrapped around me, but I don't trust myself
I drove by your house, but you don't live there anymore

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
'Cause I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
’Cause I don’t really like myself without you

Title: Aliens Exist
Release Date: June 1, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-aliens-exist-lyrics
Song Description: Aliens Exist is a song about lead singer Tom Delonges belief in aliens. Tom, who has a strong fascination and belief in extraterrestrial life and even claims to have made contact, wrote the song.

Following his departure from the band in 2015, DeLonge decided to devote time to the exploration of Unidentified Aerial Phenomen. In a 2016 interview with Mic.com, DeLonge dismissively commented on the song:


Mic: How many people have made a joke about your Aliens Exist song in relation to this project [Sekret Machines]?

Tom: [Laughs] Yeah, isnt that the weirdest thing? Its weird that people remember that song. Its, like, an eighth album track from, like, 20 years ago.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Hey Mom, there's something in the backroom
Hope it's not the creatures from above
You used to read me stories, as if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
What if people knew that these were real?
I'd leave my closet door open all night
I know the CIA would say, "What you hear is all hearsay"
Wish someone would tell me what was right

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday

Title: ANTHEM PART 3
Release Date: October 20, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-anthem-part-3-lyrics
Song Description: ANTHEM PART 3 is the opening track on blink-182s tenth album, ONE MORE TIME It adds to the series of previously released songs, Anthem (final track on Enema of the State, 1999), and Anthem, Pt. 2 (first track on Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, 2001).

Taken literally, ANTHEM PART 3 thematically differs from the prior entries. While Anthem is a song about the aftermath of a teenage house party and Anthem, Pt. 2 is a protest song about not having control over ones own future, ANTHEM PART 3 is an uplifting track about persevering in the face of unnamed trials. However, all three songs speak to relatable feelings for listeners of the bands age.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Everything that we've tried
We'll keep waking up to that light
We'll see rising of a new tide
We are starting up a new life
When your head is hanging too low
When your heart is 'bout to explode
You can make it anywhere, go
There's no fear when you get here, give up that ghost

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
When your dreams, they seem like they're dead
Like a pounding deep in your head
When your job has gone to deep shit
If you've fallen off of that list
When you're clenching both of your fists
Like you aimed and then you just missed
Let the record show that you're fixed
Don't you give up now, just get up and resist

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
This time, I won't be complacent
The dreams I gave up and wasted
A new high, a new ride and I'm on fire
My old shit ends here tonight

And after you had the time of your life
Flatlined and led toward the light
You'll despair the wreckage and find
No one gave a fuck that you died

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
This time, I won't be complacent
The dreams I gave up and wasted
A new high, a new ride and I'm on fire
My old shit ends here tonight

[Outro: Tom DeLonge]
It's my head, it's my mind
All made up, it's alright
If I fall on some nails
If I win or set sail
I won't fail
I won't fail1Embed

Title: MORE THAN YOU KNOW
Release Date: September 22, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-more-than-you-know-lyrics
Song Description: More Than You Know is Toms favorite song on the album. He likes it the most for the rad double bass drums Travis put together for it, since the song called for it., as well as how its different for mixing elements from metal and punk rock together.

More Than You Know is the 3rd single for the album. The song was shown with its length and loaded for release on music streaming platforms, when the album and track list were officially announced on September 18th. This ignited rumors' about a double single release, which turned out to be true as the song was released together with One More Time as a surprise track on September 21th.

The existence of this song was announced by drummer Travis Barker on January 19th, by sharing a 5 second clip of the song via an Instagram story.

Two months later, on March 14th, Travis shared the presumable tracklist of the album via an Instagram story. Among the deciphered songs was More Than Youll Ever Know, again confirming its existence.

The song was long thought to be the second single. On May 4th, the day blink-182 kicked off on their world tour, a Stall page was launched on their official website. Among the writings written on the wall, sharing links to tweets, music and social media pages, was the line I dont feel pain, but I feel more than youd ever know, as well as MORE THAN YOULL EVER KNOW 6/2. The line was scratched out and hidden in a corner, most likely since the song didnt release that day.

On September 5th, during maintenance on the Stall page, a snippet of the song could be heard, as the cleaner plays it on his headset while removing most of the writings on the wall. A week later, a snippet of the piano intro could be heard when flushing one of the toilets on the page.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Your bed is the last battlefield, a nuclear weapon
Let's search and destroy all the innocent throats we can step on
You bury your face underneath half-hearted confessions
You poison yourself with the thought I won't love you to death

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Black lights across my face!
Words that we'll never write!
Wait for the phone to ring!
Back to the starting line, go!

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
I don't feel pain, but I feel more than you'd ever know
I don't feel shame, I don't have highs, but I've got some lows
I feel a bit cursed, I've been numb and sinking down like a stonе
I don't feel pain, but I feel more than you'd ever know
Morе than you'd know!

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
I shook all the leaves from your tree and left you with nothing
I can't see the colors you see, they won't see me coming
The ivy is starting to creep, it grows through the awnings
It's dawning on me that I shouldn't be trying at all

[Bridge: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
It goes on and on, I swear we don't belong
On and on (We're lonely), I swear we don't belong (Wherever)

Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Yeah, my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero just because

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Yeah, just because

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
And my girlfriend likes UL and DHC
And she's so smart and independent, I don't think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And when I feel like giving up
Like my world is falling down
I show up at 3 A.M., she's still up watching Vacation
And I see her pretty face, it takes me away to a better place, and

[Post-Chorus: Tom DeLonge + Mark Hoppus]
I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything, everything's gonna be fine

Title: Going Away to College
Release Date: June 1, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-going-away-to-college-lyrics
Song Description: Mark Hoppus allegedly wrote this song in about ten minutes after watching Cant Hardly Wait while feeling home-sick on Valentines Day, 1999. He began to think about the pain of high school love and parting ways come graduation.

Mark is the only Blink-182 member to go to college, as he wanted to be an English teacher. However, his college days didnt last long because he found the classes to be tedious and useless.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Please take me by the hand, it's so cold out tonight, I'll
Put blankets on the bed, I won't turn out the light, just
Don't forget to think about me, and I
Won't forget you, "I'll write you once a week," she said

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Why does it feel the same to fall in love or break it off?
And if young love is just a game, then I must've missed the kickoff
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on
Anything, but I'd go through Hell for you, and

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus and Tom DeLonge]
I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared, so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me

[Verse 3: Mark Hoppus]
I'll think about the times she kissed me after class, and
She put up with my friends, I acted like an ass, I'd
Ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture still hanging in her locker?

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus and Tom DeLonge]
I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared, so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place but you're so beautiful

Title: Stockholm Syndrome
Release Date: November 18, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-stockholm-syndrome-lyrics
Song Description: The term, Stockholm Syndrome, was coined in the early 70s to describe the puzzling reactions of four bank employees to their captor. It describes the psychological phenomenon in which hostages come to identify with and even care for their captors in a desperate, usually unconscious act of self-preservation. blink tackles this delusion in one of their most experimental tracks and place themselves in the mind of a paranoic person.



The interlude preceding the song is read by Joanne Whalley and consists of recited World War II-era love letters.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
This is the first thing I remember
Now it's the last thing left on my mind
Afraid of the dark; do you hear me whisper?
An empty heart; replaced with paranoia
Where do we go? life's temporary
After we're gone; like New Year's resolutions
Why is this hard? Do you recognize me?
I know I'm wrong but I can't help believing

[Verse: Mark Hoppus]
I'm so lost, I'm barely here
I wish I could explain myself, but words escape me
It's too late to save me
You're too late, you're too late

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus]
You're cold with disappointment while I'm drowning in the next room
The last contagious victim of this plague between us
I'm sick with apprehension, I'm crippled from exhaustion
And I dread the moment when you finally come to kill me
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
This is the first thing I remember
Now it's the last thing left on my mind
Afraid of the dark; do you hear me whisper?
An empty heart; replaced with paranoia
Where do we go? life's temporary

Title: All of This
Release Date: November 18, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-all-of-this-lyrics
Song Description: blink-182 shared a member of staff with The Cure, as the American rockers were huge fans of Robert Smith, they managed to get him on this track.

Of blink-182s concerns that Smith might not want to collaborate because of their earlier, jocular music, Smith said:

Nobody knows what kind of songs you are going to write in the future and nobody knows the full potential of any band. I really like the music you sent me.

This would have been the bands fourth single if it wasnt for the hiatus. The music video would have been directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who said,

I love this song. Almost did a video for this. It would have been about vampires.

This song, fading in with the melody of Easy Target, describes the mans inability to move on and get over the girl once he realizes hes been completely used by her. It shows that even upon learning who your crush truly is and how they think of you, youre still not going to want to move on as you keep that perfect image fresh in your mind.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Robert Smith]
With all of this I know now, everything inside of my head
It all just goes to show how nothing I know changes me at all

[Pre-Chorus: Robert Smith]
Again, I wait for this to change instead to tear the world in two
Another night with her, but I'm always wanting you

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge, Robert Smith]
Use me, Holly, come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me, Holly, come on and use me
We go where we know

[Verse 2: Robert Smith]
With all of this I feel now, everything inside of my heart
It all just seems to be how nothing I feel pulls at me at all

[Pre-Chorus: Robert Smith]
Again, I wait for this to pull apart, to break my time in two
Another night with her, but I'm always wanting you

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge, Robert Smith]
Use me, Holly, come on and use me
We know where we go

Song Description: This song is about a really bad party Mark goes to. Just when he think the party cant get any worse, he sees a girl that he likes. However it soon turns out that this girl isnt all that she seems.

The Party Song is one of Blink-182s fastest songs. Its so fast that it was never performed live for years until they managed to pull it off in 2011.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
Here you go, motherfuckers!

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Do you wanna come to a party?
My friends picked me up in a truck at 11:30
This thing's at a frat house, but people are cool there
Reluctant, I followed, but I never dreamed there
Would be someone there who would catch my attention
I wasn't out searching for love or affection
So I payed my three in and the girls got in free
Shined the beer for tequila and we headed into the party

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
And then, in the backyard, some terrible ska band
Someone in the background was doing a keg stand
This place is so lame, all these girls look the same
All these guys have no game, I wished I would've stayed
In my bed back at home, watching TV alone
Where I'd put on some porn, or have sex on the phone
Far from people I hate down from anywhere State
Trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party

[Pre-Chorus 1: Mark Hoppus]
And then I saw her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She wasn't wearing underwear
At least I prayed that
She might be the one
Maybe we'd have some fun
Maybe we'd watch the sun rise
But that night, I learned some girls try too hard
You might also like[Chorus: Mark Hoppus  & Tom DeLonge]
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
And some girls try too hard to impress
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
With the way that they dress
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
With those things on their chests
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
And the things they suggest to me
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)

[Verse 3: Mark Hoppus]
I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
The names she was dropping, the games she was playing
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Flys
How she's down with the wise well-constructed disguise
Now I'd rather go dateless than stay here and hate this
Her volume of makeup, her fake tits were tasteless
So I said I'd call her, but never would bother
Until I got turned down by another girl at a party

[Pre-Chorus 2: Mark Hoppus]
So when you see her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She won't be wearing underwear
And you'll discover
This girl's not the one
And she'll never be fun
You should just turn and run
Because you'll find out that some girls try too hard
[Chorus: Mark Hoppus & Tom DeLonge]
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
And some girls try too hard to impress
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
With the way that they dress
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
With those things on their chests
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
And the things they suggest to me
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na)

[Outro: Mark Hoppus & Tom DeLonge]
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
Some girls try too hard
(Duh-na-na, duh-na-na, duh-na-na)
Some girls try too hard6Embed

Title: Misery
Release Date: March 29, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-misery-lyrics
Song Description: Misery is Blinks second single from the half-deluxe, half-sequel to their 2016 comeback album, California, and was released at the end of march 2017.

Musically, this song feels a lot like the rest of California, which definitely has its influences from the bands earlier work, especially their Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, and Self-Titled LPs, but their replacement guitarist, Matt Skiba, of Alkaline Trios influence is undeniable.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I'm a wreck, I'm out of time, I barely made it out alive
I'm not bent, I'm not cracked, I'm just broken
I watched the fire burn the sea, I wrapped my car around a tree
Hold me up underneath this heavy burden

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Skiba]
There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone

[Verse 2: Mark and Matt Skiba]
Tied up to a heart of stone, I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home
Lay with me, I can't sleep, misery loves company
When I'm bent, when I'm cracked, when I'm broken

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Skiba]

Misery loves company, I don't need anyone

[Post-Chorus: Matt Skiba and Mark Hoppus]
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus]
Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake, and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion)

[Chorus: Matt Skiba and Mark Hoppus]
Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Home show, Mom won't know
Run out the back door, he's passed out on the floor
Third time, been caught twice
Forgive our neighbor Bob, I think he humped the dog

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
But good things come to those who wait, 'cause she laid me
And Mom and Dad possess the key, instant slavery
No need explain the plan, no need to even bother

White lies, bloodshot eyes
Breath of alcohol, stole it from the mall

Title: Mutt
Release Date: June 1, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-mutt-lyrics
Song Description: Mutt was inspired by Benji Weatherly, a pro surfer Tom once lived with who had a lot of sex.



The song played during Benjis part in the 1998 surf video The Show. Before its placement on Enema of the State, Blink would call it The Surf Song when they played it live.

The song also had a notable and fitting role in an iconic scene in the 1999 sex-comedy American Pie. After the main character, Jim, sets his webcam up to spy on a female peer as she undresses, he runs as fast as he can to a friends house to watch the feed. Blink 182 actually makes a few cameos in the same scene.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
He pauses shaving, and he tells himself that he is the bomb
She has her curlers set, her credit cards are paying the funds

[Pre-Chorus 1: Tom DeLonge]
He's not that old, I've been told, a strong sexual goal
They go out every day, she goes every way
Oh yeah, they don't even care at all

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
She's open, waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy, often, they've typically
Been starved for attention before

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
She smokes a dozen and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
He took the seat off his own bike because the way that it felt

[Pre-Chorus 2: Tom DeLonge]
He wants to bone, this I know, she is ready to blow
They go out every night, his pants are super tight
Oh yeah, they don't even care at all

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
She's open, waiting for more (She's open, waiting for more)
And I know he's only looking to score (He's only looking to score)

Title: Blame It on My Youth
Release Date: May 8, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-blame-it-on-my-youth-lyrics
Song Description: The lead single off blink-182s 8th studio album is a slow pop-punk track that reminisces on the band members' childhoods. Blame It On My Youth sees Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba singing about how they grew up, how they joined the band, and how the world they grew up in led them to become the people they are now.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Matt Skiba]
Blame it, blame it on my youth

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I wasn't born with the rich blood
I started out with plenty of nothing at all
I got stuck in the thick mud
The flash flood, punk rock, and the alcohol
I was raised on a rerun
I was bored to death, so I started a band
Cut my teeth on a safety dance
My attention span never stood a chance

I wasn't made for the good life

Cut myself on the neighbors' fence

Title: Brohemian Rhapsody
Release Date: July 1, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-brohemian-rhapsody-lyrics
Song Description: In a track-by-track breakdown of California for Fuse, producer John Feldman shared the story of how he and Blinks Mark Hoppus came up with this :30 goof.


Mark and I are coffee fanatics. Verve is one of my favorite coffee places in L.A. We were there before a session one day, drinking coffee and talking. We had Cynical and we thought we needed another fast one. He had the lyric, Theres something about you I cant put my finger in, he has these classic one-liners, so we said, Alright, lets do a fast punk song.

We were jacked on espresso, we knew we were going to use that lyric, and that one came together from start to finish, from the inception to the mix, literally in nine minutes. It was over before it even started.

The name is a parody of Queens famous song Bohemian Rhapsody from 1975s A Night at the Opera, which was a much longer 6-minute track with multiple movements, as opposed to this track which is a simple, short 30-second punk song with two lines.

Lyrics:

[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
Josie, you're my

Forget when I
Don't meet expectations
Everything you wished came true
In the end, we all blamed you
Even though, as they all know
You weren't the only one, two
Three, four...

Why do you still keep it around
When you know it brings me down? I'm hating everything
And I know that you dated other guys
But I got to wonder why you'd leave it out for me (Shit!)

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Why am I still hanging around
When I know it brings me down? I'm hating everything
And you are getting rides home in his car
You're making out in his front yard, I'm hating everything

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright, it blinds me, I wish that this would end

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
I can't get my feet up off the edge
I kinda like the little rush you get
When you're standing close to death
Like when you're driving me crazy
Hold on as we crash into the earth
A bit of pain will help you suffer
When you're hurt, for real
'Cause you were driving me crazy

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Bite your lips, your words a robbery
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know? I'm here to stay

Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell

And it's driving me crazy

Are you back again?

Song Description: Carousel finds a lonely Tom DeLonge looking back at his school days fondly. His reminiscing of those carefree days send his emotions round like a carousel.

Carousel is also the first blink-182 song officially written by the DeLonge/Hoppus duo. According to Anne Hoppus, Marks sister, in Tales from Beneath Your Mom:

The two met in Toms garage. Tom pulled out a red notebook in which he had written music and lyrics  they played four hours Mark and  Tom played their guitars together. Even on that first night, the two started co-writing songs, songs that already sounded like the band that would be Blink 182. A little known fact: Carousel, the song that would eventually be a crowd favorite, actually found its beginnings that night in Toms garage.

Carousel has been released in two different versions  the first version is on their demo Buddha, and the other is on their debut album Cheshire Cat. In 2005 it was also included in their Greatest Hits album, due to a large amount of fans pushing for the inclusion.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel
Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitude's a reason to die

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Just you wait and see, as school life is a
It is a woken dream, aren't you feeling alone?
I guess it's just another, I guess it's just another
I guess it's just another night alone

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile
A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again

Title: Home Is Such a Lonely Place
Release Date: July 1, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-home-is-such-a-lonely-place-lyrics
Song Description: A slow-tempo balladesque song that narrates Hoppus' struggles by seeing his son grow up.
The producer for California, John Feldman, said:

We knew we needed a ballad, whatever that means for Blink, for the album. For two weeks we talked about what that could be, what does that look like for Blink, that mellow moment between the chaos of Cynical and Los Angeles and even No Future, those big energetic moments. This song was Marks idea, it was Marks lyric of Home is such a lonely place with you. His son is probably the smartest guy Ive ever met, Jack [Hoppus.] Hes a Mensa kid. Hes literally studying at Oxford right now. Hes 13. We were talking about what the day is going to look like when weve had our families for so long, whats going to happen when they leave? What are our lives going to look like when we built them around our children? He had this concept of our kids being gone. Everyone cried when we played it for them. Mark and Travis made it sound Blink to me. Skiba put his second verse into that song and made it his own. That song is a very special moment on the record
Lyrics:

We're falling faster than we can fly

Song Description: California has blink-182 paying tribute to their hometown, and reflecting on life there.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Beige little boxes in a row
Neighbors and friends that you don’t know
Here’s a form, go wait in line, can’t you see I’m doing fine?
It’s what I’ve always wanted
Two little kids out on the lawn
Once we had love, now it’s gone
Good things haven’t happened yet, I’m empty as a movie set
It’s what I’ve always wanted

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]
Hey, here’s to you, California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather, spending time inside together
Hey, here’s to you, California

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Wearing all black out on the beach
Faces I’ve seen in magazines
Let’s take a walk out on the pier, watch the shoreline disappear
It’s what I’ve always wanted

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]
Hey, here’s to you, California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather, spending time inside together
Hey, here’s to you, California

Title: Sober
Release Date: July 1, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-sober-lyrics
Song Description: Sober narrates the story of a drunk who has had some troubles with his partner. He knows he messed up and wants to make it up to her (as he believes shes very special) but will only be able once he sobers up.

In a June 2016 NME Magazine article about the album, Mark Hoppus explained a bit about the tracks background and meaning:

We wrote it with Patrick Stump from Fall Out Boy. The second verse is about a Sid-and-Nancy romance  two lost souls who only have one another and are lost in the world.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Na na na na na na na nanananana na na na
Na na na na na na na nanananana na na na

[Verse 1: Matt Skiba]
I woke up in the pouring rain
West side Humboldt, seven AM
Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
With the radio on and a new black eye
Because I bet you, you couldn't knock me out
And I guess you, you really got me now
Black sedan ran a red light
Just a drunken bike messenger on Tuesday night

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

She undressed and we stumbled downstairs
Fell onto the table as the neighbors just stared
We laughed out loud and smashed their lights
Digging with our hands in the dirt outside
And she dragged me to the edge of town
And she slapped me, then she pulled me down
I can do bad and you can do better
Spending all night getting lost together

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I know I messed up and it might be over

Lyrics:

[Intro: Tom DeLonge]
Soaked your clothes in kerosene
Cleanse the mind of ketamine
Slide your mom on top of me
Wash yourself with turpentine

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
My arms I've raised again
Today I don't feel bitter
I have no path within
Don't know if I'll get better

[Pre-Chorus 1: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
My own mind's unclean
Can't taste anything

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
What if I'm not like the others?
A broken man, a Frankenstein
What if my heart won't recover?
I'll clean myself with turpentine

[Post-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Working at the factory
Stick the veins of nicotine
Wash yourself with turpеntine!

My mind breaks with ease
Sticks and stones and dreams

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
What if I'm not like the others?

Wash yourself with turpentine (turpentine, turpentine, turpentine)

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus]
Sharks smell the blood in the water
We're all just lambs to the slaughter
It's only all the time, this time
A generation lost and forgotten
Clawing at the lid of the coffin
Your god ain't comin' back this time
[Interlude: Tom DeLonge]
Quit your job and have a drink
Take a pound of ecstasy
Blah, bl-blah, bl-blah, fuck
Wash yourself with turpentine!

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
What if I'm not like the others?
A broken man, a Frankenstein
What if my heart won't recover?

Title: Darkside
Release Date: July 26, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-darkside-lyrics
Song Description: The fourth single from blink-182s 8th studio album, Darkside is similar in meaning to fellow Californian single Shes Out Of Her Mind. The track tells the story of a guy who fell in love with a girl that has a dark side. Nevertheless, regardless of her ways, he will go join the dark side with her so they can do the things she loves together.

Considering the fact that Mark Hoppus talked a lot about depression  leading up to the album, dark side might be referring to depression. In that context, the song takes on another meaning beneath the superficial and tells the story of the struggles of supporting a person going through depression.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Matt Skiba]
She's a girl dressed in black from another world
Lives and breathes like a girl from another world
She don't know my name (She don't know my name)
She don't have the time of day
Celebrate, medicate 'til we numb the pain
In the sun‚ it's still dark‚ like it always rains
She don't feel the same (She don't feel the same)
She don't have the time of day

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And I wait‚ and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait‚ and I wait
And I wait for her
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait‚ and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you

You would leave, but you need me to numb the pain
You're possessed and you slept through another day
You don't feel the same
And I don't have the strength to stay

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait

Title: Quarantine
Release Date: August 7, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-quarantine-lyrics
Song Description: Written and recorded entirely in quarantine due to COVID-19, the lyrics reference life while in lockdown and president Donald J. Trumps wishful thinking that has hurt the United States recovery.

Mark compares how boring the quarantine is to the things hed rather be doing and references ways people have been keeping themselves entertained while staying at home. The song has clear late 80s early 90s punk influence, from bands like The Offspring, Black Flag, and NOFX.

Unfortunately, Matt Skiba doesnt have a home recording studio like his bandmates, so hes missing from this track.

Blink-182 has been actively working on a new EP. According to drummer Travis Barker, theyre hoping to release it soon with this being the lead single.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I guess I'm blessed to be so fucking bored
And hiding from this
Phantom antigen that wants to
Send us to the morgue

[Chorus]
Quarantine, fuck this disease
I’d rather be on Star Tours or stuck at the DMV
Quarantine, nah, not for me
I thought that things were fucked up in 2019
Fuck quarantine

[Verse 2]
Some people hit the bottle
Some people hit the books
Some people storm the Capitol
Some second-guess parenthood

[Pre-Chorus]
It'll disappear in April, just like a miracle
We don't need social distance, we don’t need old people
So throw the shop doors open, save our economy
We don't need ICU beds, or PPE

[Chorus]
Quarantine, fuck this disease
I'd rather watch some magic or do press in Germany
Quarantine, no, not for me

Hey, kid, don't quit your daydream yet

Seems like you’re lost and alone
Hey, kid, don't listen to your head
It only fills you with dread and with doubt
Left looking for an easy way out

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you don't know
Oh no, you don’t know
[Chorus]
I wanna feel happy days, happy days
Happy days, happy days
Walls of isolation inside of my pain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change
I wanna feel happy days, happy days
Happy days, happy days
All of this frustration inside of my brain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change

[Verse 2]
Some nights, you call for the jaws of life
To pull you out of the crash
A forgotten ghost from your past
When enough doesn't cut it
When you're backed up against a wall
Is it the life that you wanted
When you could never have it all?

Face down in the deep end
Face down every weekend
Face down and I’m bleeding
There's no sound when you're leaving
We faced all of our demons
We chased all of our dreams and
Don't know where it leads us
We don’t care at all
[Chorus]
I wanna feel happy days, happy days
Happy days, happy days
Walls of isolation inside of my pain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change

All of this frustration inside of my brain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Push it out, fake a smile
Avert disaster just in time
I need a drink, 'cause in a while
Worthless answers from friends of mine
It's dumb to ask, cool to ignore
Girls possess me but they're never mine
I made my entrance, avoided hazards
Checked my engine, I fell behind

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Duh da, duh da, duh da, duh da duh, I fell behind
Duh da, duh da, duh da, duh da duh

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone, I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this, like the prom
I get too scared to move, 'cause I'm a fuckin' boy

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Remember when I was in
The grocery store, now's my time
Lost the words, lost the nerve
Lost the girl, left the line
I would wish upon a star
But that star, it doesn't shine
So read my book with a boring ending
A short story of a lonely guy

Title: Every Time I Look for You
Release Date: June 12, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-every-time-i-look-for-you-lyrics
Song Description: Featured in American Pie 2, this song taps into the theme of teenage love, an aspect Blink describes so eloquently in many of their songs. The fast paced guitar and drums compliment the idea of fleeting young love, something many listeners can relate to. The protagonist, however, is disillusioned with not being able to be with the girl who transfixes his heart, body, and mind.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus and Tom DeLonge]
Never found out why you left him, but this answer begs a question
Too blind to see tomorrow, too broke to beg or borrow
Young and stupid, left wide open
Hearts are wasted, lives are broken

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus and Tom DeLonge]
One more point of contention, I need some intervention
Approached with vague intentions, betray my short attention
Span the distance, bridge the border
Beg forgiveness 'round the corner

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Every time I look for you, the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But every time I look for you, the sun goes down once more

[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Will the last one out, please shut the door

[Verse 3: Mark Hoppus and Tom DeLonge]
More time apart will give you a few more months to argue
Is this too much to live through, it always seems too far to
Drive the point home, send more letters

I never did do anything that she asked

I never did quite understand what she meant
In spite of everything, in spite of everything

I left another message, you are never around

Title: Asthenia
Release Date: November 18, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-asthenia-lyrics
Song Description: Asthenia is an eerie song about isolation and contemplating loneliness. Tom DeLonge explained the songs meaning in the albums liner notes:

This song is about one thing only, an astronaut sitting in a space capsule about the size of a car, floating above the earth. Hes contemplating if even coming back or not will make a difference on such a negative place. A song about the loss of hope. A term was coined for the breakdown of life in space and it is called Asthenia, the name of the track. At the beginning of the song are actual NASA transmissions.

Song Description: A song which tells the story of young love and all the bright possibilities they can have, providing they stay strong and stick together through hardship. It is believed that Tom wrote this for his wife Jeniffer as they were a couple for a long time when they were teens and they grew up to have two kids.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Nineteen, your eyes are glowing to my beating heart
Oh, it seems like it is fine as my hand is moving up your arm
And you never really know where it goes up until it starts
I got my eye on you, whatcha gonna do?
Daydream near a stream with the linear bites
Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night
And I can't picture you, but I sure got the feeling right
What a crazy world, pretty little girl

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise
And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news
And you reached for my hand, I was scared in your room
We fell on the floor and we started to move
And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop
Up my back, they would climb just as I came unglued

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
She said, "If you break my heart, then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again"
If you play the part, then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark, if we hold on tight
We'll be there to try it again

In the rain, with the drink from the back of the bar
I would raise up my voice, you would raise it up more
We'd forget that our lives being apart, it is hard
We'd thought we were close, but it still feels far
Can we learn to get by if we learn to have scars?
If we learn to forgive and accept who we are

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
She said, "If you break my heart, then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again"
If you play the part, then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark, if we hold on tight
We'll be here to do it again

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Wait a minute, hold up a second
Don't leave me here with this feeling, like I'm the one full of regret
Like I never did good for us both, like you never did
Pull out that weapon
And stick that knife in my back, was I supposed to accept it
When your words are like
More than just sticks and stones, kinda like a bullet
A hollow tip that's lodged in my bones, and I can't just swallow it
My pride is more than all that I own, so I gotta give it away
And some of the times I'm all the way wrong
But can't you see past me and see my fucked up home
That made me the meanest, the devil is just singing along
To the song I write 'til I'm alone at night
And I hang up the phone and bite my tongue
'Cause I know that me and you is just only right, but
One, one, one, one...
[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
It's a cry from the past, we have been through a lot
Every year has been great and a few have been tough
And your kids, they will reach for the stars up above
We'll sit and relax as we're cheering them on
The ropes to the light from the crib to the grave
We started alone, in the end we're okay

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
She said "If you break my heart, then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again"
If you play the part, then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark, if we hold on tight
We'll be there to try it again5Embed

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Six bottles went down the drain
One hour's a waste of time
I’d ask if you feel the same
Still pushing that chance to try
Your breath in this cool room chill
Long hair that blows side to side
You speak and make time stand still
And each time you walk right on by

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Like violence, you have me, forever and after
Like violence, you kill me, forever and after

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge, Mark Hoppus]
Can’t count all the eyes that stare
Can’t count all the things they see
She kills with no life to spare
Just victims are left to bleed
One drink and the pain goes down
Soft shadows lay by her feet
Lay soft as you slowly drown
Lay still as you fall asleep (fall asleep)

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Like violence, you have me, forever and after
Like violence, you kill me, forever and after
And after, and after
And after, and after

Who’ll stand by your side? So watch my eyes
Watch 'em turn while you go change, curtains down
When all their skill was cut, and I bled
There were forces of John Jones, I can’t make you happy
It seems all I ever do is try, you could never cut me
Deep enough to leave a scar
So take this gift, it’s something to save)

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]

Like violence, you kill me, forever and after

Title: On Some Emo Shit
Release Date: September 20, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-on-some-emo-shit-lyrics
Song Description: On Some Emo Shit tells the story of a guy whos girlfriend seems to have disappeared. Hes seen trying to cope with all the thoughts of loss and loneliness; he feels like hes failed her and thinks that death might be the only way he could put himself to rest.

Its unclear whether the girl has committed suicide by jumping or has simply disappeared. The narrator presents an ambiguous description of the girls situation.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I suppose we got lost in Brooklyn
There's a poster on my wall
With a picture that says you're missing
My friends say I should rip it apart
Thought I saw you at the bodega
Thought I heard your voice at the bar
Time is slipping out through my fingers
I'm wishing on a burned out star

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Skiba]
They say forgive and forget
As long as I live, I'll let
These feelings pound in my chest
Maybe I am better off dead

[Chorus: Matt Skiba & Mark Hoppus]
The last time that I saw her, she was standing on the edge
Of a good time, been a long time, tell me how could I forget?
She had questions in her eyes, oh, I should have realized
That it was over, yeah, it was over
The last time that I saw her

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Thinking back to times in Manhattan
And that SoHo gallery
Saw the sights and your favorite paintings
You were as priceless as can be
Now I'm looking back at the city
The one that they say never sleeps
How'd things get so dark and shitty?
Sunrise always gives us the creeps

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
Now you're just a stranger
And I feel like I let you down
Your friends say I'm a failure
And I could never prove 'em wrong
So call me when you're lonely
And maybe we can work it out
Fall back in our routines
Like nights I still dream about
The last time that I saw her
The last time that I saw her

The last time that I saw her, she was standing on the edge

Remember the days we would drink on the train

Naked Raygun live at the Cabaret Metro
Ten bucks to get into a fight you can't win
Boots and braces, yellow laces
Oxblood traces of the night before

Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights

I can't wait 'til I'm off of work

I climbed through your window at 3am
We listened to The Smiths and The Violent Femmes
Yeah, we both sang, "Why can't I get one kiss?"

Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
I'll never let you down, boy, I'll never let you go
Her subtle hint of life is so innocent and scary
"So, tell me that you're here, boy," she says as if she knows
When God took her with time, God made me quite alone
It's like the universe has left me without a place to go
Without a hint of light to watch the movement glow
When our song was slowly starting, your memory felt so real
At first, against my will, but God invented chills

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Yeah I, I saw your ghost tonight, the moment felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine, my wounds would start to heal

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
The kids are in a hurry, and I'm just full of fear
The lights make bodies blurry, it's getting hard enough to hear
It's like the evidence is cared for and evidently clear
If I never leave this dance floor, then I'll never leave you here

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Yeah I, I saw your ghost tonight, the moment felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine, my wounds would start to heal
I felt your ghost tonight, and God it felt like hell
To know you're almost mine, but dreams are all I feel...

You're always too loud, everything's too loud
Now that all my friends left, this place is fucking dead
I wanna move out, when can we move out?"

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
This shit has gotta stop
I'll run away...

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
"Get the fuck up", she said, "your life is meaningless
It's going nowhere, you're going nowhere
You're just a fuck up", she said, "I'll live alone instead"
She said, "you don't care", I know, I don't care

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I'll never ask permission from you
Fuck off, I'm not listening to you
I'm not coming home
I'm never going to come back home

[Verse 3: Mark Hoppus]

Title: Wendy Clear
Release Date: June 1, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-wendy-clear-lyrics
Song Description: The title of Wendy Clear comes from Hoppus' boat, named Wendy, and how boaters end transmissions by letting other boaters know the channel is open for use, or clear. Hoppus wrote the song while on tour with MxPx about having a crush on someone that you are not supposed to like.

In this case it was specifically someone who worked at Blink-182s then-record-label MCA.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Let's take the boat out on the bay
Forget your job for just one day
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
It might be inappropriate, because
Either way, our band gets dropped, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret? Or do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
The three-date theory's getting old
Everyone is getting left out in the cold
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
So I'll see you with another guy who pretends
Not to hear you when you cry, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]

And I'd play with a nuclear device

Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
I learned a lot today, not sure if I'll get laid and
Not sure if I'll fail or pass, kissed every girl in class
Everybody would waste it all to have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun, fucked up when it's all done

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on

[Post-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
And break the truth with more bad news
We left a scar, size extra-large

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Sip a drink of the alcohol, end up kneeling in bathroom stalls
Eyes are red and my movement's slow, too high, got vertigo

Title: No Future
Release Date: June 22, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-no-future-lyrics
Song Description: No Future was released early on June 22 through Blink-182s YouTube channel.



No Future was a song we cut off the record at one point. [We were] talking about the idea of how people absorb music these days. In the 90s it was very much album-based. Youd buy an album, grab a CD, put in your car and listen to it. It took effort to replace the CD with another CD, it took effort to burn a CD with a bunch of different artists. Now you just click a button and youve got a playlist of 100 different artists. The mindset I was going into was coming out of 5 Seconds of Summers second album where there are 18 songs on that record to some extent, were probably hard to digest for some of their fans. To have that much new music in an era where people can only really tolerate two to three minutes of new music at a time. We thought we were going to do an 11-song record and an EP but Travis said No, were gonna fucking do this we way we want. I cant argue with the greatest drummer of our time, the legacy that he and his band has.

http://www.fuse.tv/2016/06/blink-182-california-producer-john-feldmann-track-by-track?utm_campaign=fuse&utm_source=twitter&campaign=scl%7Ctwt%7Cfsc&utm_medium=social#7

My agenda was to have an album that was palatable for a generation of ADD kids. In the end, Travis was right. No Future could be my favorite song on the record. We were talking about punk rock history. For me, it started with the Sex Pistols, God Save the Queen has a no future lyric in it. The idea of a nihilistic society and punk rock coming along and saying We dont believe in the government, we dont believe in society, we believed in free will and doing what we want, that concept of early punk came through in this song.

We were going to call the album No Future for a long time. In the end, the guys debated the idea of what this is and in the end realized [naming it No Future] would be like shooting yourself in the footwere coming out saying This is a new band, this is a new soundbut theres no future? It feels very cool and young but the sentiment of it became negative and we made a very positive record. It didnt fit the whole idea of what the record is overall.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
She said, "Tonight's a waste of time
The next day, the sun will always rise"
Every day that you waste, every promise you break
Slips beneath the floor
It's a permanent state from a moment's mistake
But life's worth so much more

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
You don't know a thing about it, hours lost to dawn from dusk
And they don't care about you (No future!)
Let the music seal your fate, yeah, you can run, but life won't wait
Yeah, they don't care about you (No future!)

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
She said that, "It's too late to try
Someday I'll smile and say goodbye"
Every night that you fight, every demon in sight
Sleeping on the floor
Wide awake from the dream with a shake and a scream
Hope for so much more

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
You don't know a thing about it, hours lost to dawn from dusk
And they don't care about you (No future!)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Been gone a long time, I kinda lost my way, can't find it
And I caught a short ride to the grave and back this season
I can try to get by, but every time I start to panic
I'm a little bit shy, a bit strange, and a little bit manic

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
I went to a wishing well, it sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
It made its way through my heart, had fun in the promised land

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
On the narrowing line, what a way to sort my troubles
In a very short time, gonna pop, better duck and cover
Can you figure me out? I got caught like a little kid stealing
Did I say it too loud? A bit hard or a little misleading

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah, la da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah-dah

It made its way through my heart, had fun in the promised land

Cut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand

Title: Remember to Forget Me
Release Date: September 20, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-remember-to-forget-me-lyrics
Song Description: The closer of NINE, is about someone telling his mom to forget him, and let him go into life. This reflects on the band, showing how they became famous, and then toured all around the world, away from their families. The song has a close resemblance to the California single Home is Such a Lonely Place as they both detail a character leaving home.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Throw my wishes in a fountain
Deep down under where I found them
Don't let go, I'll probably drown in them
Three, two, one, but who's counting 'em?

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Hey, mom, I'm on my own
Scared to death and far from home
Can you imagine that, imagine that, imagine that?
You know I'm bad at that, bad at that, bad at that

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
You left pieces of me along the side of the road
Right after you said you'd never leave me alone
Found myself on the wrong side of the door
I'll come in if you let me
I got a song in my head you played me over the phone
Left the light on upstairs, but there ain't nobody home
All the nights that you end up all alone
Remember to forget me

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
This is hard, I'm one step off
I called but you're gone, I'm here but you're not
We both made a left, it don't make it right
I'm trying to forget, but remember the times

Title: The First Time
Release Date: September 20, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-the-first-time-lyrics
Song Description: The opening track to NINE, The First Time, is about the feelings you get when you try something out for the first time, whether it be taking meds, falling in love and going on a first date, or flying on a plane. It critiques how people always want a quick fix but theyll never get such high as the first time they did it.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Matt Skiba]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
First drink of the night just to get me right
The first light of the day, I know I got it all wrong
First pill that you drop only sets it off
The next morning you wake up all blurry and numb
Before all the damn insecurities
Before all your innocence is all lost
Think back to the time you were all alone
One day you'll look back and say, "Where's it all gone?"

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
Sometimes we get lost inside our little heads
Don't sleep just yet, we all know that there's nothing like the
First love, first high, there ain't nothing like the first time
Passed out last night, there ain't nothing like the first time

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
Taking all her meds (First love)
Sleeping with her friends (First high)
Find out in the end, there ain't (There ain't)
Nothing like the first time (Nothing like the first time)
Stuck inside her head (Passed out)
Jumping in her bed (Last night)
Find out in the end, there ain't (There ain't)
Nothing like the first time (Nothing like the first time)

Release Date: February 17, 1995, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-m-ms-lyrics
Song Description: M+Ms is a love song about Marks girlfriend at the time, Michellehence Mark+Michelle.

It was the very first Blink-182 song to be played on the radio. They credit radio deejay Mark Halloran on 91X as the first person to ever air Blink.

From Tales from Beneath Your Mom:

Mark: Tom was in his car when he heard it, and rolled down his window, yelling at everyone to turn their damn radios on.
Tom: I even yelled at people on bikes. Silly me, they usually dont have radios. But I didnt care, cause damn them, I had a song on the radio!

The music video was also Blinks debut music video, shot for under $10,000.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
You and I should get away for a while
I just wanna be alone with your smile
Buy some candy and cigarettes, and we'll get in my car
We'll blast the stereo and we'll drive to Madagascar

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
'Cause when I'm with you, there's nothing I wouldn't do
I just wanna be your only one
I'm grasping out at straws, thinking back to what I saw
That night on the floor when we were all alone

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
My love life was getting so bland
There are only so many ways I can make love with my hand
Sometimes it makes me want to laugh
Sometimes I wanna take my toaster in the bath

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
'Cause when I'm with you, there's nothing I wouldn't do
I just wanna be your only one
I'm grasping out at straws, thinking back to what I saw
That night on the floor when we were all alone

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
I don't believe that we were ever meant to be
Left underneath the light of dying stars (Dying stars)
Push me off of the edge of the world (Fall apart)
Watch me as I slowly fall apart
Set fire to the roof of your house
And waited for the sirens to wail (Sirens wail)
Left your favorite records to melt (Left to melt)
Listen as you damned me to hell

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me
Angel wings at the bus stop
Halos left on top of the bar
Heaven doesn't want me now
Heaven doesn't want me

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
Well, what did I think would happen?
I wouldn't dream of asking

I lived in fear that you moved on
What have I done to us? It seems
I've broken trust and shattered dreams
I only wish I'd spoken of
The loneliness since we broke up

Showed up like shadows in this crowd
Brought the fire blinding
Came here to quickly tear us down, down, down

Title: Los Angeles
Release Date: July 1, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-los-angeles-lyrics
Song Description: Los Angeles places the juxtaposition of the two images the city of Los Angeles has: one of fame, fortune, and beautiful beaches and one of the dark, dirty and dangerous places. The song slightly departures from the iconic Blink sound and incorporates a grimmer melody.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Matt Skiba & Mark Hoppus]
Day in, day out, up at 3AM with the
Searchlights shining down
Day in, day out, it's the blinding light
Underneath the dirt downtown
Whoa, listen to the sound as they
Bomb the Sixth Street bridge
Whoa, listen to the sound of the
Voices south of Fifth

We'll watch the city lights die out up on Mulholland Drive

Title: Give Me One Good Reason
Release Date: June 12, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-give-me-one-good-reason-lyrics
Song Description: In Give Me One Good Reason, Tom DeLonge asks for one good reason to be another casualty of society. He critiques everyone around him and feels like an outcast; he believes punk rock is about hating everyone else, hence, he proceeds to judge everyone around him.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Mom and Dad, they quite don't understand it
All the kids, they laugh as if they planned it
Why do girls wanna pierce their nose
And walk around in torn pantyhose? Oh yeah

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
I like the ones who say they listen to the punk rock
I like the kids who fight against how they were brought up
They hate the trends and think it's fucked to care
It's cool when they piss people off with what they wear, oh yeah

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
So give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend
They don't want to, and don't fit in

[Verse 3: Tom DeLonge]
Hate the jocks and preps, the hippie fucking scumbags
Heavy metalers with their awful pussy hairbands
Counting seconds until we can get away
Ditching school almost every single day, oh yeah

So give me one good reason
Why we need to be like them
Kids will have fun and offend

Title: Obvious
Release Date: November 18, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-obvious-lyrics
Song Description: The song explores the turmoil and confusion inherent in a relationship marked by betrayal and repetition, questioning the possibility of healing and moving forward when trust and vision are lost.

Through Obvious, Tom speaks directly to someone who he has fought with. Its still uncertain whether he speaks to a former lover or his mom (with whom he used to fight a lot growing up), but throughout the track, he states how this persons actions help the relationship between the two crumble.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge (and Travis Barker)]
I saw you again (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I think you used me again (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Should we try this before we give up and move on
And pretend to restore what we have and hold on?

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
At times like these
It's obvious

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge (and Travis Barker)]
I saw you again (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know you fucked him again (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can you comfort yourself with the sense of revenge?
Are you leaving me here with the taste of the end?

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
At times like these
It's obvious
At times like these
It's obvious

[Bridge: Tom DeLonge]
I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never had vision?

Title: 6/8
Release Date: April 27, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-6-8-lyrics
Song Description: 6/8 is one of Blink-182s most unique songs from their discography. The song has a dark and grim melody with lyrics that touch on themes like depression and fighting to escape a deep hole. It was described by writer Mark Hoppus as very different from their normal style. He told Billboard:

Some of the songs are a little bit more experimental than what we put on the record. Theres a song called 6-8 thats a very heavy song, its in 6/8 time which is why we titled it 6-8.

The band tweeted on April 27th,

This is the strangest song blink have ever recorded. Its in 6/8 time. Its aggressive and one of our favorites from the deluxe because of it.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
You live in a world I cannot believe
You create a world I don't want to see
And your forest's a stand of dead trees lost in the night
Did you ever think you'd live down the past
You just want to tie yourself to the mast
All your nightmares have come to at last, at least in your mind

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Learn to swim in rushing rivers
Breaking on the shore
Make your peace with broken streets
Your face turned towards the storm

[Post-Chorus: Matt Skiba]
This shitty guitar needs some personality!
This shitty song needs some personality!

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
Your hollow accusations no one ever hears
Your wounded senses of pride, a guilty souvenir
All your protests and vacant excuses ring insincere
(This song needs some fucking personality!)
I just want to find a car to overturn
I just want to light a fire to watch it burn
Now we're past the point of no return and no one is here

[Spoken Word: Matt Skiba]
You are afraid, uneducated on where this would lead
Going on for far too long, we are sorry for the greed
Leave us in pieces and places, war-torn and wronged

[Bridge: Matt Skiba]
In between whispers and screams
You permeate my soul
Lost between nightmares and dreams
You decimate this home

Song Description: Hey Im Sorry was a Japan-exclusive bonus track, before it was released on the deluxe edition of California, it bears little similarity (beyond the title) to Im Sorry from Blink-182s album Dude Ranch.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hold me down deep under water
Wave goodbye to all your daughters
Break yourself but why even bother?
Fathers pray for princes instead
Have your fill of disappointment
Two more years of unemployment
All your fears come to life and leave you
Boarded up, abandoned, and spent

Outside your front door bleeding to death
Everything you've never wanted here to seem just like

Hey I'm sorry I lost your memory (Whoa-ah-oh)

Title: Rabbit Hole
Release Date: July 1, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-rabbit-hole-lyrics
Song Description: Rabbit Hole sees a narrator asking for its mind to be cleared, as unwanted thoughts keep him awake at night. The narrator wishes not to go into a spiral of negative thoughts and wants to break free from all these ideas that haunt him.



Producer John Feldman said:

Mark and I were talking about depression and negative thinking, how one thought can spiral into thousands of thoughts of Whats the point of anything? and Fk it all. As an adult, to go backwards and ask, What was that first thought that caused me to go through this spiral of nothingness? The idea of the song is Im not going to go down this rabbit hole of negative thinking. Thats where the song started. Where it ended [feels] more playful, the logo, and were talking about the O.G. skankin' rabbit legacy.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]

Song Description: In December 2022, drummer Travis shared he was working on an until then unknown song via an Instagram story. The title of the song was vaguely readable when zooming in on the shot.

Users were speculating whether the song was called Blink Was or Blink Wave, But bassist Mark Hoppus confirmed on Discord That the song is called Blink Wave because it was the working title.

The song ended just like Adams Song ending.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
"Hey," you said, I'm sorry but I ain't quite heaven-sent
My nervous system's just a nervous wreck
And on and on we're torn apart and strung along
Yeah, we tried, but never could escape the long goodbye
And crashed into the dark beneath the ice
And in my dreams I lie awake and kick the sheets

You are so inordinary
Seems so scary to be buried

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
You know I just can't keep my mind off you
The pain's so deep, I can't get through
With the midnight black and white tattoos
'Cause the same old fights, they just won't do (they won't do)

Title: Up All Night
Release Date: September 27, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-up-all-night-lyrics
Song Description: The first single from Blink 182s reunion album, Neighborhoods, Up All Night marks a different direction from the once immature rockers, conjuring an image of desperation when faced with the horrors of life in the middle of the night.

In the track by track for Neighbourhoods the band talk about how Up All Night is

probably the best indication of what blink is becoming on this new album. I think that it sounds like blink it sounds everything weve done since the band broke up, it sounds like things that we did before the band broke up. And it also sounds like a step forward, I think its a great introduction to this record.

Everyone wants to call it all around our
Life with a better name
Everyone falls and spins and gets up again with
A friend who does the same
Everyone lies and cheats, their wants and needs, and
Still believes their heart
And everyone gets the chills, the kind that kills when
The pain begins to start

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
As I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night

[Verse 2: Tom and Mark]
Everyone's cross to bear the crown they wear on
Endless holiday
Everyone raises kids in a world that changes
Life to a bitter game
Everyone works and fights, stays up all night to
Celebrate the day
And everyone lives to tell the tale of how we
Die alone some day

Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
As I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night, they keep me up all...

Title: Go
Release Date: November 18, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-go-lyrics
Song Description: Go is a song about domestic violence. It tells the story of a protagonist named Mark (based off of Mark Hoppus, the lead singer) who heard his father yelling inside and saw his mother leaving in fear. He urges his mother to just drive away, but his mother says there is nowhere to go, so they just return to the abusive father. The song uses the engine dying as a metaphor for the fear and broken heart. The rest of the song is the protagonist wondering how evil men can get away with being evil.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Are we all victims of opportunity
Locked outside the door back in '83
I heard the angry voice of the man inside
And saw the look of fear in my mother's eyes

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge, & Mark Hoppus]
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Mom, get in the car and let's drive away
She said, "I'm sorry, Mark, but there's nowhere to stay"
Gave up all her hope and went back inside
Hid her broken heart and let the engine die

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge, & Mark Hoppus]
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know

[Verse 3: Mark Hoppus]
Why do evil men get away with it?
Can't you see that I'm in a world of shit?
Turn your back on hope and go back inside
Stop my bleeding heart and let the engine die

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
All her signals are getting lost in the ether
(That's what she wanted)
She's a landslide with a city beneath her
(That's what she wanted)
So take a good look, so you'll never forget it
(That's what she wanted)
Take a deep breath, I know I'm gonna regret it
(That's what she wanted)

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Holly's looking dry, looking for an easy target
Let her slit my throat, give her ammo if she'll use it
Caution, on the road, lies, lies, and hidden danger
Southern California's breeding Mommy's little monster

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
She's got a mission, and I'm collateral damage
(That's what she wanted)
She's the flower that you place on my casket
(That's what she wanted)
Savor the moment, 'cause the memory's fleeting
Take a photograph, as the last train is leaving

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Holly's looking dry, looking for an easy target
Let her slit my throat, give her ammo if she'll use it
Caution, on the road, lies, lies, and hidden danger
Southern California's breeding Mommy's little monster

Eyes are open, words are spoken
Here's to the sunrise
Head is loaded, cards are folded
Under the moonlight
Can you remember, you remember the last time
We woke up sober?
Can you remember, you remember the last night
You ran me over?

Are we halfway gone or halfway there?

Left alone, we're only halfway home
Sink like stones, fall into the unknown
Break me down, I'm not afraid of you, pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to, left alone to wonder

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba & Mark Hoppus]
Mind is open, thoughts are woken

Title: TERRIFIED
Release Date: October 20, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-terrified-lyrics
Song Description: Terrified is a reworked Box Car Racer song, written in 2018 and, after Travis brought the idea, finished as a blink-182 song in 2022.

Travis stated the song made the album, even though he had said before it would never see the light of day. Producer Aaron Rubin gave a vague answer to a question if Dance With Me was the reworked song, as was thought for a long time, and if the song would appear at all. Weirdly placed capital letters in his answer form Terrified.

Mark buried his ego for this song to be on the record, Looking past all the shit and just making good music.

The song might have a connection with Elevator, another Box Car Racer song, featuring Mark Hoppus. Both songs describe a scene of the feelings of a person falling  to their death after jumping off a building, as well as how the fall is perceived by spectators.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
I can't feel my body
And nothing else here matters at all
The shapes become electric
Innocence and magic for all
I'm liftin' past the skyline
And no one seems to notice my fall
In and out the timelines
Now I see the truth of it all

[Chorus: Tom Delonge]
We'll go (Oh-oh)
Terrified (Oh-oh)
We'll go (Oh-oh)
Terrified

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Laughter from the children
The streets are made of silence for you
I will reach the summit
To hold you in my arms with a view

And she was like a starry night
Like a Ferris wheel, full of blue-green eyes
And a heart of steel, always on her own
Almost never real

When the night will begin, the pain, it won't end
Even if she falls in love
Back, you wanna turn back, your heart will attack

And she was like a blade of ice
Like a lonely road, clearest day alive
Always sharp and cold, always beautiful
I am such a fool

When the night will begin, the pain, it won't end
Even if she falls in love
Back, you wanna turn back, your heart will attack

Lyrics:

[Intro: Blink-182]
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la la la la la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la la la la la

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Outside the carolers start to sing
I can't describe the joy they bring
'Cause joy is something they don't bring me
My girlfriend is by my side
From the roof are hanging sickles of ice
Their whiny voices get irritating
It's Christmas time again

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
So I stand with a dead smile on my face
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste
Oh god, I hate these Satan's helpers
And then I guess I must've snapped
Because I grabbed a baseball bat
And made them all run for shelter

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
It's Christmas time again
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand all year
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer
You people scare me
Please stay away from my home
If you don't wanna get beat down
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone

Well I guess it's not cool to freak on Christmas Eve
'Cause the cops came and arrested me
They had an unfair advantage
And even though the jail didn't have a tree
Christmas came a night early
'Cause a guy named Bubba unwrapped my package (Hot damn!)

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
It's Christmas time again
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand all year
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer
You people scare me
Please stay away from my home
If you don't wanna get beat down
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone

[Outro: Mark Hoppus & Tom DeLonge]

I won't be home for Christmas

A lightning bolt without a cloud in the sky
We grew up Siouxsie and The Banshees
10:15 on a Saturday Night

[Chorus]
It'll never be the same stage right
But we'll always have that coffee life
I'll see you again on the other side

[Verse 2]
How'd you get back to the hotel?
Where did you end up at the end of the night?
How can I go back to Holmdel?
How can you leave without saying goodbye?

It'll never be the same stage right
But we'll always have that coffee life
I'll see you again on the other side

Title: Apple Shampoo
Release Date: April 14, 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-apple-shampoo-lyrics
Song Description: Apple Shampoo from Blink-182s Dude Ranch.

The second single from Dude Ranch.

Written by Mark Hoppus about the end of his relationship with Elyse Rogers of Dance Hall Crashers. The name of the song comes from one of Hoppuss abiding memories of Rogers  her hair smelled like apples, from the type of shampoo she used.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
She didn't mean to deceive you, believe me
But sometimes the hardest part is conceiving

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
The good intentions that you had, now only came to this
And although she saw the mark, the arrow missed

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
It isn't exciting reciting the stories
Of kind words turned hurting, when routine gets boring

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Both getting tired of punk rock clubs
And both playing in punk rock bands
The start was something good
But some good things must end

[Verse 3]
And she said, "It could never survive with such differing lives
One home, one out on tour again"
We may never come back, the strike of a match
The candle's burning at both ends
And now she knows too much, and I'm too fucked up
It's awkward trying to make my move
I'll pretend that I'm fine, show up right on time
But I know I'll never be that cool

With a walk-on part of a background shot, from a movie I'm not in

[Bridge]

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And now I realize, I should have kissed you in L.A
But I drove home all alone, as if I had a choice, anyway
Where are you coming from? What are you running from?
Is it so hard to see?

And if you're feeling scared, remember the time we shared
You know it meant everything (everything)
You know that it meant everything to me

Song Description: This song is about the ever discussed punk rock credentials that bands like blink-182 have to keep proving, but theyre beyond that now.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
I'm like a cat in a cage, locked up and battered and bruised
I am the prodigal son, a shameful prodigy too
I am the love of your life, battering ram and confused
I turn each day into night, I stand there waiting for you
There is desire to fight, but I have nothing to prove
But with the crowd and some lights, I start to feel things move
Do you have something to hide? 'Cause I think that we all do
I am a child inside, back up and give me some room!

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I'm just a bastard child, don't let it go to your head
I'm just a waste of your time, maybe I'm better off dead
You turned us loose in the night, I'm fucking Jekyll and Hyde
We'll have the time of our lives, although we're dying inside

[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
So let me go, go, so let me go, go
Just let me go, go, I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go, so let me go, go
Just let me go, go, I'm never coming home

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Don't start to panic for me, 'cause I have nothing to lose
I am as bright as the sun, I burn up all that I choose
Up on the side of the field, I see a city with lights
I touch her face and I kneel, she tells me she's not alive
I am too nervous to run, the kids who scatter and hide
To reach and grab for someone, but end up buried alive
The world is waiting for me, a move that I rarely use
I start to feel my feet, they kick down walls as they move

That he's lost and alone, yeah
I hate our favorite restaurant
Our favorite movie, our favorite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high, and never answer the phone

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
I can't forgive, can't forget
Can't give in, what went wrong?
'Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
I'm sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place, it's fucking cursed, and it's plagued

Release Date: October 20, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-bad-news-lyrics
Song Description: Bad News is a return to form for blink-182, seemingly Dude Ranch punk sounding. The song was originally written about Marks feelings towards Tom when he left the band the second time around, but Mark changed certain lines to make it more relatable to the masses.

Lyrics:

Years of fighting and hiding feelings
All those nights staring at the ceiling

[Verse: Mark Hoppus & Tom DeLonge]
I keep on thinkin' that I might be better alone
(I might be better alone)
Sometimes when I get back from work, I wish no one was home
(I wish no-one was home)

Like I'm always missin' what we can't get back

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I'm givin' you bad, bad news
I think I might've fallen out of love with you
Years of fighting and hiding feelings
All those nights starin' at the ceiling

Now I think I know what I already knew
The truth is out, so thеre's no pretending
I guеss there's no such thing as a happy ending

Release Date: July 1, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-kings-of-the-weekend-lyrics
Song Description: Feldy: This is another song we didnt think was going on the record. We had too many songs. When listening back with the whole team, the management, the label, we realized the riff is so good, it just felt right. There are no songs on the record that have a great, classic guitar riff that people will recognize and so [it stuck.] This was song number three, Travis raised his hand and trumped us all and reminded us that this is what Blink is, this epic guitar thing. Its not lyrically as deep some of the other songs, but its the party song. Weve all had day jobs and we all know what its like to have that day off to do what we want, this is that song.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
Can you read my thoughts? I'm not sure what I said
I feel dumb, and long night coming
Did you steal my prayers? I don't know where I was
I feel numb, and all or nothing (all or nothing)

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]
It's Friday night, let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go, because we got no control (no control)
Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we
Ever had, thank God for punk rock bands

[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]
Until Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
I can feel my head falling off my neck
I need something to keep going
So just take my hand, only seconds left
The clock's running, our time's coming

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]
It's Friday night, let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go, because we got no control (no control)
Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we
Ever had, thank God for punk rock bands

Title: Pathetic
Release Date: June 17, 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-pathetic-lyrics
Song Description: Pathetic is the first track on blink-182s second studio album Dude Ranch.
The songs lyrics describe how the band members are romantically inept and, simply put, pathetic. But even though they recognize how big of losers they are, they really couldnt care less.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus + Tom DeLonge]
I know I'm pathetic, I knew when she said it
A loser, a bum's what she called me when I drove her home
There's no more waiting and sure no more wasting
I've done all I can but she still wants to be left alone

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus + Tom DeLonge]
You got, you got, you got to help me out
And I'll try not to argue
No one, no one, no one likes a dropout
Mistakes are hard to undo

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, (Both)]
Don't pull me down, this is where I belong
I think I'm different, but I'm the same and I'm wrong
Don't pull me down, this is where I belong
I think I'm different
(This is where I belong)

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus + Tom DeLonge]
I think it's disgusting, believing and trusting
If I gave a fuck there would be nothing for me to prove
Although it's amusing, it's slightly confusing
I've done all I can but her ego is still hard to move

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus + Tom DeLonge]
You got, you got, you got to help me out
And I'll try not to argue
No one, no one, no one likes a dropout
Mistakes are hard to undo

Don't pull me down, this is where I belong
I think I'm different
(But this is where I belong)

[Outro: Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, (Both)]
Don't pull me down, this is where I belong
I think I'm different
(This is where I belong)3Embed

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I see signs up in the sky, disappear before my eyes

Guess we're all desensitized, forgot the meaning of our lives
Woah-oh, woah-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
What’s going on with me? Everybody seems
So lost, I wanna leave
2023, who the fuck are we?

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
Remember when we were young
And we'd laugh at everything?
Got caught up in a world
That forgot how to dream
I'd never thought we’d end up here
We're back in time, to the best years
Remember when we were young?
We thought we knew everything

[Refrain: Tom DeLonge]
Where did our childhood go?
I wanna know
Where did our childhood go?
I wanna know

And we'd laugh at everything?

Remember when we were young?
We thought we knew everything

Where did our childhood go?
I wanna know
Where did our childhood go?

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Please mom, you ground me all the time
I know that I was right, all along
And I'm hoping, remember, I'm a kid
I know not what I did, just having fun

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday, I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Nothing to lose, a boy who
Went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do, they can't trust me
Because I blew it once before

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Shit dad, please don't kick my ass
I know I've seen you trashed at least one time
Can I blame it on one of my dumb friends?
It's been awhile since I have used that line

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday, I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
A bottle for breakfast, trying to let go
Remember your voice, but it's only an echo (Only an echo)
I still got your makeup here on my pillow
And I'm seeing ghosts outside of my window

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Skiba]
It was just one time, one time
Started turning into two times a few times
Ain't been sober in a long time, a long time
Yeah, you used to be all mine, all mine

[Chorus: Matt Skiba & Mark Hoppus]
It feels like last night you came over
Now I wake up and you're nowhere
I've got my head hungover you
I guess I'm still hungover you

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
I was so wasted, I couldn't see you
Didn't seem like a choice, no, I'd never leave you (Never leave you)
Nights that we stayed up, days that we sleep through
I can still see your face outside of my window

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Skiba]
It was just one time, one time
Started turning into two times a few times
Ain't been sober in a long time, a long time

Title: Generational Divide
Release Date: June 21, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Blink-182-generational-divide-lyrics
Song Description: The second extracted single from blink-182s 8th studio album is a short 49 seconds song that features a comeback to Travis Barkers fast drums. Contrary to popular belief, of this song being about fans who are critical of their new sound, the track sees Hoppus meditating on a heated argument he had with his son and seeing how the age gap between the two has led to a generational divide.

Some pictures from the Generational Divide music video set were shared by Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba on their Instagram profiles.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
Is it better?
Is it better now?
Are we better?
Are we better now?
Is it better?
Is it better now?
Are we better?
Are we better now?

[Verse: Matt Skiba & Mark Hoppus]
All we needed was your lifeline (Is it better? Is it better now?)
We swore we'd be better than the last time (Are we better? Are we better now?)
Don't leave, tell me that you're all right (Is it better? Is it better now?)
I'm not the generational divide (Are we better? Are we better now?)You might also like6Embed
