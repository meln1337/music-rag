Artist: Sum 41, Alternate Names: Pain for pleasure, Kaspir
Artist Description: Sum 41 is a Canadian rock band from Ajax, Ontario. They formed in 1996 as a five-piece consisting of lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist Deryck Whibley, lead guitarist Dave Baksh, guitarist Tom Thacker, bassist Jason McCaslin and drummer Frank Zummo.

Though they were originally called Kaspir, the group members decided to change the band’s name for a Supernova show on September 28, 1996, which happened to be the 41st day of their summer vacation. It is also hypothesized by many fans that the band’s name comes from the fact that if you take the word “fuck” and add all its letters (“F” being the 6th letter of the alphabet, “U” being number 21, etc) you get 41.

The band released their debut record as Sum 41 called Half Hour of Power in 2000. They followed it with the breakout sophomore record All Killer No Filler in 2001 and it contained several charting songs such as “Fat Lip” and “In Too Deep.”

In 2002, the band released Does This Look Infected? which was also a commercial and critical success. The singles “The Hell Song” and “Still Waiting” drove the band to stardom, and with their 2004 record Chuck, they planted themselves as giants in the punk rock scene.

Though it was received with mixed reviews, their 2007 album Underclass Hero became the highest grossing album of the band to date. It was then followed by Screaming Bloody Murder in 2011, 13 Voices in 2016 and Order in Decline in 2019. While none of these albums have been able to reach the commercial success as their predecessors, they have nevertheless received praise from fans and critics alike.

In May 2023, the band announced their intention to disband. They made one last record in 2024 to finish Sum 41 which is a double-album called Heaven :x: Hell.

Sum 41 occasionally played as an alter-ego 1980s heavy metal band called Pain for Pleasure during shows.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
The faster we're fallin', we're stoppin' and stallin'
We're runnin' in circles again
Just as things were lookin' up, you said it wasn't good enough
But still, we're tryin' one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we're just tryin' too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Stead of goin' under

[Verse 2]
Seems like each time I'm with you, I lose my mind
Because I'm bendin' over backwards to relate
It's one thing to complain, but when you're drivin' me insane
Well then I think it's time that we took a break

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we're just tryin' too hard

[Bridge]
I can't sit back and wonder why
It took so long for this to die
And I hate it when you fake it
You can't hide it, you might as well embrace it
So believe me, it's not easy
It seems that something's telling me

[Chorus]
I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under

Title: Fat Lip
Release Date: April 22, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-fat-lip-lyrics
Song Description: Fat Lip is Sum 41s  lead single from their 2001 album All Killer, No Filler.

The song gives an insiders look to some of the fun stuff they used to do growing up in the suburbs.
The title serves as a satirical portrayal of this. The term fat lip is used to describe a swollen mouth or lip, caused by an injury or blow. This emphasizes the songs daredevil-like lyrics.

The stylistic mix of hip-hop, heavy metal, pop punk and skate punk made the track uniquely catchy, which ultimately resulted in the song topping the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Deryck Whibley, Steve Jocz, Dave Baksh, All]
Stormin' through the party like my name was El Niño
When I'm hangin' out drinkin' in the back of an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

[Pre-Chorus: Deryck Whibley]
Well, I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never goin', never showin' up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearin' "act your age"

[Chorus: Deryck Whibley, Deryck Whibley & Jason McCaslin]
I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

[Verse 2: Deryck Whibley, Steve Jocz, Dave Baksh, All]
Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

[Pre-Chorus: Deryck Whibley]
'Cause we like havin' fun at other people's expense, and
Cuttin' people down is just a minor offense, then
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn

Well, I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat
Back-packed, and I don't give a shit about nothin'
You be standin' on the corner talkin' all that kufuffin
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffin'
'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringin' off the hook
You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
The doctor said my mom should've had an abortion
[Chorus: Deryck Whibley, Deryck Whibley & Jason McCaslin]

Song Description: Still Waiting is a song written by Sum 41s lead vocalist Deryck Whibley and was influenced by the events of 9/11. In an MTV interview he said:

Its not directly about 9/11 or the war on terrorism. Its about the war on everything. Its about the world as we know it. Its no secret that the world doesnt get along and theres all this hatred. Its everything to do with how this world functions.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

[Verse 1]
Drop dead
A bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes
Have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's up to me

[Chorus]
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

[Verse 2]
Ignorance
And understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left to stop the bleeding?
How far
Will we take this?
It's not hard to see through the fakeness
So tell me what would you say

Can't help myself
And no one knows
If this
Is worthless
Tell me (tell me, tell me)
So
What have we done
With a war that can't be won?
This can't be real
'Cause I don't know what to feel, no

[Chorus]
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same things to you
It's just a matter how you solve them
And knowing how to change the things you've been through
I feel I've come to realize
How fast life can be compromised
Step back to see what's going on
I can't believe this happened to you
This happened to you

[Verse 2]
It's just a problem that I'm faced with; am I
Not the only one who hates to stand by?
Complications that are first in this line
With all these pictures running through my mind
Knowing endless consequences
I feel so useless in this
Get back, step back, and as for me
I can't believe

[Chorus]
Part of me won't agree
'Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Part of me won't agree

Title: Walking Disaster
Release Date: July 23, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-walking-disaster-lyrics
Song Description: Walking Disaster takes the listener through a story of someone leaving home due to disagreements with his parents. According to Whibley, the song illustrates his tattered childhood and his reflections as an adult.

The song opens with a vision of Derycks past, damaged by his conflicting parents; he leaves home as he sees himself caught in between his parents arguments. The song ends on an optimistic note (he returns home) expressing his maturation as an adult, in the light of being able to see things differently and ultimately, understanding his childhood.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I haven't been home for a while, I'm sure everything's the same
Mom and dad both in denial, an only child to take the blame
Sorry mom, but I don't miss you, father's no name you deserve
I'm just a kid with no ambitions, wouldn't come home for the world
You'll never know what I've become, the king of all that's said and
Done, the forgotten son
This city's buried in defeat, I walk along these no name streets
Wave goodbye to all as I fall...

[Verse 1]
At the dead end I begin to burn the bridge of innocence
Satisfaction guaranteed a pill away catastrophe
On a mission, nowhere bound, inhibitions underground
A shallow grave I have dug all by myself

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I've been gone for so long
I can't remember who was wrong
All innocence is long gone
I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief where I belong

[Chorus]
A walking disaster, the son of all bastards
You regret you made me, it's too late to save me

And he said, "Far as I can tell, it's just voices in my head
Am I talking to myself 'cause I don't know what I just said?"
And she said, "Far is where I fell, maybe I'm better off dead
Am I at the end of nowhere, is this as good as it gets?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I've been gone for so long
I can't remember who was wrong
All innocence is long gone
I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief where I belong

Far in, ohhhh. Wait, we singing?
Take everything left from me!
All! To! Blame!

Super-size our tragedies (You can't define me, or justify greed)
Bought in the land of the free (Land, free)

[Chorus]
And we're all to blame
We've gone too far, from pride to shame
We're trying so hard, we're dying in vain
We're hopelessly blissful and blind to all we are

[Post-Chorus]
We want it all with no sacrifice!

[Verse 2]
Realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear
Stand to salute, say thanks to the man of the year
How did we all come to this? (You can't define me, or justify greed)
A greed that we just can't resist (Resist)

We have no choice left with our backs against the wall!

[Chorus]
And now we're all to blame
We've gone too far from pride to shame
We're hopelessly blissful and blind, when all we need
Is something true to believe

[Post-Chorus]
Don't we all, everyone
Everyone, we will fall

[Outro]
Because we're all to blame
We've gone too far, from pride to shame
We're trying so hard, we're dying in vain
We want it all, everyone, don't we all...6Embed

Title: Catching Fire
Release Date: July 19, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-catching-fire-lyrics
Song Description: Catching Fire, the closer to Order In Decline, was written from a place of hopelessness and pain. After the tragic death of music friends such as Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell, Deryck felt lonesome. He also wanted to write a song about his wife and ended up writing about how devastating it would be for him if she died.

The song is about how someone feels like they have failed someone who has passed on, and he cant help but regret his inability to do something about it.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I never told you how I felt
Though I thought I'd said it all
And I never knew you needed help
Well, 'cause you always seemed so tough
But now I'm here alone
Without you by my side
If only I had known
That you kept it all inside
Now I'm trying to understand
Just trying to find a way
But forgive you, I just can't
It's all just too much for me to take

[Chorus]
And if I failed you, well, I swear I tried my best
But now you're gone, so all your tears can lay to rest
Just so you know
You meant the world to us, I know that it's too late
And all I want's another chance, I can't accept that you have left

[Verse 2]
Look at all this damage done
Are you happy with yourself?
And we thought the best was yet to come
And, and I thought I knew you oh so well
And the days just go by
While the moment seems to last
Like catching fire
All is gone, and it all went up so fast

And now you're gone, so all your tears can lay to rest

That you have left

[Chorus]
And if I failed you, well, I swear I tried my best
But now you're gone, so all your tears can lay to rest

You meant the world to us, I know that it's too late

Release Date: May 15, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-underclass-hero-lyrics
Song Description: As lead singer Deryck Whibley wrote the song with an us against them theme

Underclass Hero is written from a different angle, the song refers prominently to society and the struggle of high-class versus the underclass instead of youth against adults as in All Killer No Filler. The song also features the more classic punk-rock themes of anti-establishment. This is the theme song for MTVs Crash My School. The songs intro is often compared to be similar to the bands previous single Handle This

Lyrics:

[Intro]
One, two, three, four...

[Verse 1]
Well, I won't be caught living in a dead-end job
While praying to my government, guns, and God
Now it's us against them, we're here to represent
And spit right in the face of the establishment

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I don't believe (in having faith in nothing)
Stand on my own (and got no sympathy)
Wasting the youth (while being young and useless)
Speak for yourself (and don't pray for me)

[Chorus]
Well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you, 'cause we'll
Be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold, just like you

[Post-Chorus]
A call across the Underclass!
[Verse 2]
Calling out loud with no respect
I'm not the one, I'm just another reject
I'm the voice to offend all those who pretend
Unsung against the grain, I'm here to rise against

That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you, 'cause we'll

Title: Some Say
Release Date: September 29, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-some-say-lyrics
Song Description: Some Say takes a cynical view of the prevalent apathy in todays society. The narrator is depressed, pessimistic, and knows that theres nothing one can do; while observing others who are happy are blissfully ignorant and dreaming.

The track specifically references Derycks parents, who are content with their lack of understanding and wider knowledge beyond their own lives. The narrator cant find much meaning in life, or whether its worth it living on your own.

Some Say is the third single from Sum 41s third album Chuck. It was only released in Canada and Japan as a single, however, with No Reason being released instead in the U.S. and Europe.

While playing it live on the Go Chuck Yourself live album, Deryck says:

this song is about your very, very, very confused parents.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Some say we're never meant to grow up
I'm sure they never knew enough
I know the pressures won't go away
It's too late
Find out the difference somehow
It's too late to even have faith
Don't think things will ever change
You must be dreaming...

[Chorus]
Think before you make up your mind, you don't seem to realize
I can do this on my own, and if I fall, I'll take it all
It's so easy after all

[Verse 2]
Believe me 'cause now's the time to try
Don't wait, the chance will pass you by
Time's up to figure it out
You can't say it's too late
Seems like everything we knew
Turned out were never even true
Don't trust, things will never change
You must be dreaming, dreaming...

[Chorus]
Think before you make up your mind, you don't seem to realize
I can do this on my own, and if I fall, I'll take it all
It's so easy after all

[Verse 3]
Some say we're better off without
Knowing what life is all about
I'm sure they'll never realize the way
It's too late
Somehow it's different every day
In some ways, it never fades away
Seems like it's never gonna change
I must be dreaming, dreaming, dreaming...

[Chorus]
Think before you make up your mind, you don't seem to realize
I can do this on my own, think before you make up your mind
You don't seem to realize, I can do this on my own
And if I fall, I'll take it all, it's so easy after all
Believe me, it's alright, it's so easy after all
Believe me, it's alright, it's so easy after all

Title: Over My Head (Better Off Dead)
Release Date: November 26, 2002, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-over-my-head-better-off-dead-lyrics
Song Description: Over My Head (Better Off Dead) is a song recorded by Canadian punk rock group Sum 41. It was released in June 2003 as the third and final single from their 2002 album Does This Look Infected?. An acoustic version of the song can be found on the Chuck Acoustic EP. The song deals with those times when you cant remember what you did the night before. Its not about being fucked up or drunk, Whibley told MTV. Its more about the aftermath when youre hearing everything youve just done the night before, and youre like, Ah, fuck, Im better off dead. I dont regret any of the things I do and I dont mind doing them, I just hate hearing about it. Being told every morning, Dude, what did you do last night? drives me nuts.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
What happened to you?
You played the victim for so long now in this game
What I thought was true
Is made of fiction and I'm following the same
But if I try to make sense of this mess I'm in
I'm not sure where I should begin
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'

[Chorus]
Now I'm in over my head for something I said
Completely misread, I'm better off dead
And now I can see how fake you can be
This hypocrisy's beginning to get to me

[Verse 2]
It's none of my concern
Well, not to me 'cause I don't believe in fame
I guess you never heard
I met our makers, they don't even know your name
But if I had to say goodbye to leave this hell
I'd say my time has served me well
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'

I'm too awake for this to be a nightmare
What's with my disgrace? I've lost the human race
No one plans for it to blow up in their face

Who said it was easy to put back all these pieces?
Who said it was so easy to put back all of these pieces?

Now I'm in over my head for something I said
Completely misread, I'm better off dead
And now I can see how fake you can be

But lately, I feel like I don't give a shit

Concentration, never hard to break it
Situation never what you want it to be

What's the point of never making mistakes?
Self-indulgence, such a hard habit to break
It's all just a waste of time in the end
Don't care, so why should I even pretend?

It seems like leaving friends has become this year's trend
And though I can't pretend, afraid to be this way
It's not the same, but who's to blame for all those stupid things I never said?

[Chorus]
Motivation's such an aggravation
Accusations, don't know how to take them

To turn our backs away and choose to just ignore (Choose to just ignore)

It makes me feel some innocence
(Some say!) It takes away a part of me
That I won't let go of

Tell me, why can't you see it's not the way? (Not the way!)
When we all fall down, it will be too late
Why is there no reason we can't change? (No reason!)
When we all fall down, who will take the blame? Will it take?

[Verse 2]
Nothing could ever be this real (Be this real)
A life unsatisfied that I could never feel (I could never feel)

That some can't make the sacrifice (So bright!)

You've proven a real man is something you're not

So tell me, is this what the future primitive world's supposed to be?
A total abomination is what it looks like to me
No reasonable explanation, can't call it a declaration
A bigot to all, sick of it all, we all stand up, go

[Chorus]
I believe that I
Am losing faith in all of humankind
But then I realize it's plain to see
That a number is all you are to me

[Verse 2]
Not worthy of name, a number you'll get
A symbol of meaningless, void of respect
A matter of time, you get what you've earned
We'll take pleasure in watching you burn

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me, is this what the future primitive world's supposed to be?
A total abomination's what it looks like to me

What can I say? I'm no angel
I'm not forsaken
But I can bleed!

Tear me open, I believe God will set you up to bleed
And no one can deceive what is meant to be
And "Bloody Murder!" we will scream

Well, I guess it's time for me

Deryck compares this experience with his previous addictions and realizes that, like his other destructive patterns, this needs to stop before he (or his partner) dies.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Oh, my love, how do I explain how I've come to feel this way
I'm addicted to the pain even more than words can say
Every hit hurts like your kiss, like a needle to a vein
My last words of this begin, "I want you..."

[Chorus]
She said, "you don't even know how just how much I need it
How far will you go?"
(I just want to feel you cum...)
You make me so crazy, but I'm okay
Just pain me, take it very slow
'Cause I'm in love tonight

[Verse 2]
So, now that it has come to this, I'll be your dirty little thrill
For the world I wouldn't miss, 'cause I just want to feel your kill
Self-inflicted masochist, how could anyone resist?
My last words of this begin, "I want you..."

[Chorus]
She said, "you don't even know how just how much I need it
How far will you go?"
(I just want to feel you cum...)
You make me so crazy, but I'm okay
Just pain me, take it very slow

Tell me the difference between love and death
You fear them both as they take your breath
Tell me the difference between love and death
You fear them both as they take your breath

[Bridge]
And all of this comes to an end
But I cannot resist your death

[Chorus]
She said, "you don't even know how just how much I need it
How far will you go?"
(I just want to feel you cum...)
You make me so crazy, but I'm okay
Just pain me, take it very slow

Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
All bets are off, but you still think that you've got a right, well
Your lucky days are numbered now, and you're to blame
You built a castle of sand, shaking the devil's hand well
At least I've still got my soul to sell

You've got to take me away, 'cause I wanna feel (wanna feel)
Something that's real (thing that’s real)
Help me escape, 'cause I wanna be (I’ll take my last breath)
Left to be free, I just wanna fake my own death

[Verse 2]
You played your part of the whore, you've got some kinda nerve
Or have you forgot I don't forget? And you're too late
You walk beside the dead where the angels never tread well
At least I've still got a soul to sell

[Chorus]
You've got to take me away, 'cause I wanna feel (wanna feel)

Title: Twisted By Design
Release Date: October 7, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-twisted-by-design-lyrics
Song Description: This song instills confidence and power into me. I believe the beginning of the song refers to past pains and how they tend to rise back to the surface in the back of your mind, despite how long ago they happened, in this case alcoholism, which put Whibley in the hospital. He uses the pain of his past to give him confidence and the ambition to forge his own life, learn from his mistakes and move forward. To pursue ones own happiness.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I've got my scars to bear
Stitches just can't repair, oh, whoa
There's no one to blame this time
Absolution's waiting on a prayer
I'm breaking down the walls
Unveiling my share of faults, oh, whoa
This blood on my hands is a blessing
In a lifetime twisted by design, and I'm so alive!

[Verse 1]
Is it a threat, or the cure?
'Cause it's a brave new world I don't know if I'm ready for
Just a test
'Cause I'm miles up above you, flying with no safety net
I don't believe in fate, although this time, I think I've met my match
Why are the dreams so hard to catch?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you forget in time what it feels inside
When you live right on the line, but I'm so alive!

[Chorus]
They say, believing is the hardest part
But I say, with every beat of my heart
I alone, will find my way
And get right back to the start
They say, the fire in your heart is gone
Well, I say, it's really only just begun
All along, you know that I'm
I'm twisted by design, I'm twisted by design

Taking the days as they come
But now, I'm seeing the world as if it had a thousand sounds
Oh, I admit, oh, that they're somewhere along the lines
I guess I lost my grip

[Pre-Chorus]
But luck has turned the page, and time is up, I need to get things
Right, one more chance to catch the light
Cause you forget in time what it feels inside
When you live right on the line, but I'm so alive!

[Chorus]
They say, believing is the hardest part
But I say, with every beat of my heart
I alone, will find my way
And get right back to the start
They say, the fire in your heart is gone
Well, I say, it's really only just begun
All along, you know that I'm
I'm twisted by design, I'm twisted by design

[Bridge]
Starting over again, but the further I get
I can't stop these walls from closing in
Going out of my head, all the tears that I bled
They're not enough to take my pain away!
[Chorus]
They say, believing is the hardest part
But I say, with every beat of my heart
I alone, will find my way
And get right back to the start
They say, the fire in your heart is gone
Well, I say, it's really only just begun
All along, you know that I'm
I'm twisted by design

In some ways I've changed
And I've left it all behind

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Well, if you say it's better off this way
It’s time that I let you go
It's been on my mind for days
And well, the truth's I already know
What you’ve done and where you've been
I know exactly every move you make
It's time that I give up on our mistakes

[Verse 2]
And I don't want to be stuck inside a memory I don't want to keep
It's hard to believe when all you find in every word is more deceit
So do what you will
And go on and play the game
As straight as you keep your face
When tables turn, you just might find that I will say

[Chorus]
I'm turning away
Because I feel like I can't go on
While we’re living in this lie
And when all of my faith is gone
I don’t even want to try
There's nothing that you could say
That could ever change my mind
And with all of these steps I take
It’s giving me back my life

Days have come to an end, today's the day that we meet again
The self-inflicted inebriation guilt never lies alone

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Nevertheless am I dressed for the occasion
It's number 32 now here's the situation
If the beat moves your feet then don't change the station
Now pack your bags cause we're leaving on a permanent vacation
Well, I'm a disaster
A microphone master
Put on your tape and rock your ghetto blaster
It's not about the money, cars, hotels, or resorts
About sweating all the bitches in the biker shorts
I'm Dave Brown Sound and you see me running late
Cause I'm always making time to make your girlie feel great
And I'm Bizzy D from way down town
I'm known to rock a mic like a king was a crown
When I'm on top I'm gonna borrow that bootie
Hustling deals like Mickey Macoote
When I wake up I like a pound of bacon
Start off the day with my arteries shaking

[Chorus]
Rock! It's what we're all about
It's what we live for
C'mon, shout it out

Just from pickin' up the mic' in a usual way
We rock guitars with a bass that's funny
We could even tear it up at a grade-school party
Well I can keep the beat, but I can't break dance
It's hard to look cool in crazy pants
But I wear 'em anyway even when they look whack
It's my personal way to bring the '80s back
Gave up the life of serving burger and fries
High cholesterol, getting grease in my eyes
I was drinking underage, I belong on stage
Hello, rock 'n' roll, goodbye, minimum wage
I'm teaching you a lesson in mic' control
Making rhymes with my letters in my cereal bowl
Lucky number seven every dice I roll

[Verse 3]
Well let's avoid confusion by making one thing clear
The rock we're bringin' is gonna instill fear
And the power we control should be revered
We sold our soul to Satan two times last year
Take a look to the point, to the point I'm making
We rock the oven when we're stone cold baking
And we get outta hand and bust up the room
JD is to blame for the Legion of Doom
Cause I'm the B-I double Z-Y
You ain't better than me, I ain't your average guy
I like to watch girls shake with a kung fu grip (wah)
Well the goon platoon is on the flavor trip
We beat down London, we slayed LA
Got an APB on the jams we play
So when you're on the stage cold grabbing your cock
Pledge allegiance to the Sum, the new kings of rock

'Cause the life I knew has a different view
Tonight, I'm breaking the chain

Days pass me by like I'm saving wasted time
I'm not all right, I think I've fallen for the lie, aye

I'm breaking the chain from the life I knew
Beaten black and blue, it's time
To be face to face with the lies I choose

I've done my time with the devil in disguise
'Cause the life I knew has a different view
Tonight, I'm breaking the chain

'Cause I'm tired of chasing, chasing yesterday, I've lost the feeling!
Scars don't fade, they never go away, and I'm still bleeding!
Every step I take, all the chains that I break
It brings me one step closer
I'm breaking the chain

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You're running fast and missing, but cannot help convincing
The reasons you gave me are all wearing thin
It's not meant to hurt you, but let me assure you
It's not what I said, but intentions you read

[Chorus]
So when you hold onto the past, then you
Will break down what little is left
Yeah, there's nothing more you can't ignore
And say, "It makes no difference to me"
It makes no difference to me

[Verse 2]
Now that you're older, life's weighing on your shoulders
You can't seem to keep things so perfectly straight
With most things so basic, you might as well face it
You can't help but worry it's all just begun

[Chorus]
So when you hold onto the past, then you
Will break down what little is left
Yeah, there's nothing more you can't ignore
And say, "It makes no difference to me"

[Bridge]

Or in the hands of someone else

Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh...

[Verse 2]
Broken thoughts and alibis
Conscious disappears in time
A voice is all that I can show
That all that I have is a soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh...

[Bridge]
Yeah...
Like a setup to fail you're a dead beat on parade
With one foot in the gutter, and the other in the grave
You've cooked your silver spoon so black
So die!

A victim or just a tragedy?

Dream little dreams that only I believe
Now that I see beyond the light
I know I'll be I'll be alright...4Embed

All this illusion seems so clear

We have the passion of the unbroken
And our souls we will not sell

We'll damn you all to hell

[Verse 1]
Waiting for a sign, I guess I missed it on the way
I tried to walk the line, but it’s more than I could take
I get so tired of waiting, your signal’s fading out
You're on the outside before you even know you're out of place
I've had enough, and your time is up
So, give me something, that one thing real
And I'll say yeah, 'cause I've been going out of my
Head again, just waiting for a lifeline

Let me see you hold up your salute to the sky
While you sing it out, bleeding out your lungs 'til you die

[Chorus]
Give it to me, give 'til you ain't got anymore
'Cause I need it to believe it, that you got any soul
Give it to me, give 'til you ain’t got anymore

Goddamn, I'm dead again, woe is me
Seems to be that I'm a wanted man these days
I'm down that rabbit hole
But I don't want to go
Rot in peace down a dead-end street
I believe, I hear 'em calling, but they're ringing out of key
They're saying "Listen, boy
May God rest your soul"

Got a lease on borrowed time
It's catching up to me, now let it bleed!

The old king is dead, gone in one fatal blow (I don't believe!)
And I don't believe he'll come back for more
Taking the crown of the brand new low

[Verse 2]
Take a look around, you really blew it all to hell
What's the point of trying unless you're going to do it well?
So, get off my back if I'm a goddamn misery

Song Description: Handle This is the ninth track in All Killer No Filler and is about a relationship that was doomed almost from the start. The girl mentioned was never nice, nor was she ever supportive.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You said it once before
You don't do those things you used to anymore
You say in doubt, we're fadin' out
Forgetting who we used to be

'Cause I will bring you down
I don't wanna miss, I don't think you can handle this
You've lost what you can't find

It's so easy when you're always in denial
Just in time, but out of line
I can't make all the same mistakes you want me to

Title: Pull the Curtain
Release Date: July 18, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-pull-the-curtain-lyrics
Song Description: One of Sum 41s most complex songs, Pull The Curtain shows a narrator descending into madness.

Starting with the piano coming out of With Me, the narrator looks back upon his mistakes in life, and after the first few verses, the track instrumentally explodes into a guitar solo. Afterward, it softens right before a manic bridge, and 3 overlapping voices having a free-for-all jump into the deep end of a chorus, crashing into static and fading out. The song ends with a piano outro showing the narrator trying to get help.

The piano outro bears a similarity to a previous single from Chuck, Were All To Blame.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
(Where'd I go wrong?) Pull the curtain, begin
Paranoia's wearing thin now, it's wearing thin now
(Where'd I go wrong?) Close my eyes, realize
I've become the victimized now, desensitized now

[Pre-Chorus]
The one and only day has come
I pay for all the bad things I've done

[Verse 2]
(Where'd I go wrong?) Something's wrong because I
Find the glamour in the dark side, in the dark side
(Where'd I go wrong?) Cheap regrets, can't forget
Falling victim to the debts still unpaid in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
The one and only day has come
I pay for all the bad things I've done

[Verse 3]
It's going to take me, you don't know tragedy
I've been to hell and back again to tell and
Close my eyes and lay me down to sleep
I fear the worst, my beating heart ticks to explode

[Chorus]
Suffocate the dreams in my mind

Drown the thoughts that have me confined
(Stop this heart from bleeding)
Gutter dreams as black as the night
(My intentions fold up)
No one told me empathy's a lie
(Lost in paranoia)
Suffocate the dreams in my mind
My last words, I'm choking, are all my dreams broken
(I can't stop believing)
Drown the thoughts that have me confined
The silence is deafening, my ears won't stop ringing
(Stop this heart from bleeding)
Gutter dreams as black as the night
My last words, I'm choking, are all my dreams broken

No one told me empathy's a lie...
The silence is deafening, my ears won't stop ringing...

Feel the same way now? Can't you
See, I need help to stop

Lyrics:

[Chorus]
You said you did it for the dopamine
You didn't mean to leave me so fucked up
You did it for the dopamine

God, I've been up for days
I've been losing my mind
Caught up thinking of ways I could turn back the time
Time is not on my side

Feeling empty inside now that she's gone away
I can picture you in someone else's place
And he's got his hands running down your face
Is it in my head cause I just can't let my demons go

Song Description: One of the bands first demo tapes, this song has also appeared on Half Hour of Power, where it leads into 32 Ways To Die instead instead of Handle This, and on Rock Out With Your Cock Out as a very shittily recorded demo where it does not lead into any other tracks.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It's far beyond your reach, it holds a place in time
Somewhere ahead is the back of the line
I can't relate to your mistakes
Awkwardly speaking with nothing to say

Caught up in your life, excuses are so lame
You may be different, but I'm still the same
The reasons that you thought, the intention that you caught
You say things are simple, we both know they're not

Title: March of the Dogs
Release Date: July 18, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-march-of-the-dogs-lyrics
Song Description: Undoubtedly the most controversial track of Sum 41s career.  The bands political leanings are absolutely no secret (see Rock Against Bush), especially with the release of this album.

The overt screed against President Bush led many reporters and music critics to recoil at the lyrics illustrating president Bushs head being blown away. One reporter went as far to bring the issue to Congress and argue for Deryck Whibleys deportation back to Canada.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen of the Underclass...
The president of the United States of America is dead!

[Verse 1]
I don't believe in the politics
Of chosen fools and hypocrites
Who walk a line that's tread so fine
Is it death or glory you have in mind?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And here we go, again it's mass delusion
No one knows, who leads this revolution now
As tension grows, the way to a conclusion
It's too late, there's no time
It's too late, there's no time
All for none, none for one, two, three, four

[Chorus]
March of the dogs to a beat of disillusion
Sworn under God, breeding panic and confusion
The white flag is down, send in the clowns
The carnival of sins is now about to begin

[Verse 2]
It may be I'm a pessimist
But I'd say we need an exorcist
The root of all evil's standing tall
Under God and above us all

All we know is confusion and frustration now
As tension grows, no vision of salvation

March of the dogs to a beat of disillusion

[Bridge]
And now the president's dead, because they blew off his head
No more neck to be red, guess to heaven, he fled
Was it something he said, or because of who's in his bed
By whom will we be led? From whose hand will we be fed?
All the lies by the lying liars who said
"We'll be fine, it's okay, hey, look mom, no head!"
[Outro]
Blah blah blah blah... It's the carnival of sins!
Blah blah blah blah... And a one, two, three go!
Blah blah blah blah... It's alright, I said go!

Title: Heart Attack
Release Date: May 8, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-heart-attack-lyrics
Song Description: Heart Attack is the twelfth track from Sum 41s debut album, All Killer, No Filler, dealing with the struggles of depression and the consequent lack of motivation.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Remember when there was nothin' else to do
But lie in bed and
Wonder how it was always up to you
And no one else and

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Early mornings, made by warnings
What's the point of the alarm that I'm ignoring?
It's even raining, I'm not complaining
But waking up is hard to do, so

[Chorus]
Turn my head, it's back to bed with no delay
I can't be bothered by the phone ten times today
Why get up? My morning doesn't even start 'til two
Forget reality, waking up is hard to do

[Verse 2]
Remember when we would hang out everyday?
And we would rather
Not be told what to do or what to say
'Cause nothing mattered

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Never boring, slept-in mornings
Not ashamed of the habits that I'm forming
It's not important if days are shortened
I can't make time when nothing's new
'Cause waking up is hard to do, so

[Verse 3]
What's a day when it all ends up the same
And lasts forever?
Can't complain when there's nothin' there to blame
And things can't be better

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Summer evenings, teenage grievings
Got no problem with the life that I've been leading
No concentration on hesitation
I can't make time when nothing's new
'Cause waking up is hard to do, so

Turn my head, it's back to bed with no delay

Title: The New Sensation
Release Date: July 19, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-the-new-sensation-lyrics
Song Description: The New Sensation is an anthemic rock song that seems to express discontent with the political status quo. The song clearly takes aim at the Trump administration, but as a whole, serves as a call to arms for the people to rise up in opposition against the current political climate.

Despite the politically-driven message of the song, The New Sensation takes on a darker, more rock approach rather than the traditional fast-paced punk sound fans might expect  demonstrating the bands diversity and growth over the years.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Tell me it's alright, even if it is a lie
'Cause I don't want to hear it's just a blessing in disguise
I read between the lines, given up on warning signs
But now we must face the truth, it's order in decline (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
If this will persist, then we will resist

[Chorus]
Now it's your right, 'cause every dog has got its day
And we will fight, resist in every way
Your time is up

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not one to talk, 'cause I know I have my faults
But even I know you can't evolve by building up your walls
I can't help but criticize as you tear me down to size
For all that you've done to help perpetuate the lies
A job well done

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hey, hey, hey)
If this will persist
(Hey, hey, hey)
Then we will resist

We're here to fight, resist in every way
Now it's your right, it doesn't mean that it's okay
The end's in sight, 'cause every dog will have its day
Your time is up, up

[Bridge]
As days get stranger, the pain gets greater
Is it human nature or am I insane?
The confrontation, the aggravation
The new sensation, well, who's to blame?
The days get stranger, the pain gets greater
Is it human nature or am I insane?
The confrontation across this nation
The new sensation, tell me who's to blame

[Chorus]
Now it's your right, 'cause every dog has got its day
We're here to fight, resist in every way

Song Description: Open Your Eyes shows a narrator in a relationship thats collapsing pretty quickly, and realizes now how theyve been delusional about whats been going on the whole time. He tells his partner that its not working, and theyre not themselves from when it first started.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Lately, I'm not quite myself, maybe I do need some help
Just my confusion, trust my delusion
Don't you regret you met me, go through these steps to get me
Back to where we start, 'fore I fall apart

[Verse 1]
If I could black out, it'd become so clear
Standing face-to-face with everything I fear
Watch so closely, but still, I don't see
As bad as it seems, a piece of mind I steal
In ordinary life, the consequence is real
I'm past the point of reality

[Chorus]
This isn't me, this isn't you, but it's just everything we do
'Til you open up your eyes and understand this isn't real
This isn't me, this isn't you, this is everything but true
'Til we come to realize it's what we put each other through

[Verse 2]
(Spent days without a trace and)
It's like a bad dream, that's becoming all too true
(I'm lost inside this place now)
Leaving me with nothing else left to do
Now so helpless, I'm not so selfish, tell me
How does it feel to have a face like that?
How does it feel to be replaced like that?
Now, so faceless, do you still feel?

Release Date: September 29, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-theres-no-solution-lyrics
Song Description: In this song, Deryck discusses his insecurities regarding a close relationship.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Maybe nothing else will ever be so clear
Or maybe that's only my fear
If just for one day, I wish I could disappear
Just take me far from here

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'd find out nothing new
Maybe I'd end up just like you

[Chorus]
There's no solution (no solution)
Give me truth to my conviction
Is my own confusion (my confusion)
Reality or fiction, am I out of my mind

[Verse 2]
This constant pressure that keeps hanging over me
It makes me feel so empty
It's more than anything that I could ever be
What else could you take from me

Too close to see what I thought was true

Give me truth to my conviction
Is my own confusion (that I feel)
Reality or fiction, am I out of my mind

Title: The People Vs...
Release Date: July 19, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-the-people-vs-lyrics
Song Description: The People Vs talks about what happens after President Trump leaves office, and what hes already done to the world.

Its the 9th track on Order In Decline, and its title is like a battle title: Team A vs Team B. Even though Team B isnt mentioned, its left out to our imaginations, and probably because Derycks stated many times he didnt want to write a politically charged record. Team B would probably be Trump and his government, since the band has stated they dont like him, hence the chorus saying the presidents a bad guy and hes got to go.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Another place, another time, a new direction
Maybe we can try to find some peace in time
Might be just a bit beyond your comprehension
Just a little case of pulling teeth to find

[Pre-Chorus]
That day after day
You see it slipping away from your hands
You've got to say

[Chorus]
I know a bad man when I see his face
And now we suffer as the human race
And he's a bad man, but I got faith
To end this misery, he's got to go
He's got to go, he's got to go, yeah
And all I know, this is no life for me

[Verse 2]
Well history repeats itself, it's almost insignificant
Just another changing of the guard
And I've heard it all before, it's nothing new, it's different
Still it's always hard to try and disregard

And all I know, this is no life for me

Show me the sign, give me motivation
Make me believe it's a passing trend
Sometimes I feel like we've all been hexed this time
Will this ever end?

[Pre-Chorus]
Well day after day
You see it slipping away from your hands
You've got to say it now
There's no other way, the price is too big to pay
It's about time we've got to say

[Chorus]
I know a bad man when I see his face
And now we suffer as the human race
And he's a bad man, but I got faith
To end this misery, he's got to go

It indicates how their temper makes them aggressive when they dont obtain what they want. Like much from this record, this could tie into President Donald Trump and way of reacting when things dont go as he wishes.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Just heads or tails, it's all you’ll get from me
'Cause I ain't got time , and I’ve got just what I need
If you could read my mind, you would not like what you'd find
You've got me thrown, this time's no mystery
Leave well alone and just please let me be
And you should read my mind, you'd know just how far I'd go
(That's right)

[Chorus]
But now you don't want to make me lose my shit ’cause heads will roll

[Verse 2]
You oughta slow right down, it comes right back around
Now keep these memories like a lock and key
So don’t be foolish, keep yourself in line
(Ha ha ha, well)

[Chorus]
Now you don't want to make me lose my shit ’cause heads will roll
Now you just need to worry that I just don't lose control

Title: Holy Image of Lies
Release Date: March 25, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-holy-image-of-lies-lyrics
Song Description: In the first installment in the Dark Road Out Of Hell (Often considered to be one song, many fans have uploaded all three together on YouTube as this), the narrator refers to all his musings, mostly religious, and his overall self destruction (hence their use of the word Hell to describe their victory as he breaks down in his destruction).
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I don’t believe, I think I’m falling asleep
Is this beginning or ending? Am I stuck in a dream?
I don’t want to know what I think, I suppose
Out of the light, and into this time of demise
And there’s a cross on the hill, the "holy image of lies"
I’ve opened my mind
But this dream is still real

[Pre-Chorus]
You don’t need to worry, I’m just fine
I’ve just lost my mind
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Tell me it’s over
'Cause I don’t feel a thing, at all
No conscience that’s no more

What came easy's now too late
And it was always standing right in front of me

Title: What Am I to Say
Release Date: March 25, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-what-am-i-to-say-lyrics
Song Description: What Am I To Say follows Derycks thoughts throughout the dissolution of a relationship, most probably, his final moments with now ex-wife Avril Lavigne.  The problems had been piling up over time, and finally, Deryck recognizes the relationship isnt what it once was. Its as if the couple is staying together because its easier to avoid facing their problems. He is finally realizing that if he can feel so disappointed and apathetic about the negative turns the relationship has taken, she cant be the one.

The slow pace and the sincerity of the lyrics are reminiscent of the bands previous efforts such as Best of Me and With Me from Underclass Hero.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
What am I to say? I'm all wrapped up in apathy
And I don't want to stay this way
There's nothing left to do, now that I am onto you
All I want to know is the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't want to go, but I feel like I should
Because I'm falling apart, and I might, and I, and I...

[Chorus]
How could you be the better part of me?
When we're only half of what we used to be today
Could you see this isn't what we need?
And I'm leaving all the pieces how they fell
So goodbye, farewell

What am I to say? I still remember everyday
And memories don't fade away

Title: Reason to Believe
Release Date: March 23, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-reason-to-believe-lyrics
Song Description: A dark song that portrays a feeling of hopelessness, of believing that there is no single shred of light in reality. Deryck expresses, on the opening track of the album, how long he has been looking for hope but is now starting to believe that there no such thing. A heavy opener full of self-hatred and despair that describes Derycks mindset during the tough times previous to the recording of this album.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Everybody's got a secret...
Can you tell me what is mine...

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for something for so long
To show me the answers that I want
A reason to believe in that's so strong
But I don't think that it exists
I've been waiting for something for so long
To show me the answers that I want
A reason to believe in that's so strong
But I don't think that it exists

[Verse 1]
Yeah, give me reason to believe
This world's not a sick machine
When everywhere's a dead end
In every direction
Yeah, can you give me what I need
Or just sit and watch me bleed
Because after all, you can't get
Everything you want now

[Pre-Chorus]
But all I would need is one
Thing to keep me moving on

Everybody's got a secret
Can you tell me what is mine?
Can you tell me what you'd find, I'll tell you if you keep it

Well, I have the fears
The pain, and the tears, I just can't hide
It all disappears, 'cause everything passes with the time
All you need is reason to believe...1Embed

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Hanging by a thread now, my head's down, not feeling like myself
Now, the voices inside my head are getting too loud
Screaming louder than a thousand drums
I keep counting the days, and I can't stop now
And I won't break down, I'm too proud, let's give them shit to talk
About, the pressure, the weight of the world won't keep me down
This time, I'm taking back what's mine
It's been a long time coming, and I just won't stop

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't stop, won't stop, won't stop, won't stop, won't stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, go!

[Chorus]
Go ahead, then, try to break me
Like a rat in a race until the dawn
Go ahead, then, make 'em pay, it's time
To take back the place where I belong

[Verse 2]
So, I'm done with all the chasing, I'm giving up on wasting
All my time with you now, I'm looking for salvation
I'm done with all the fake shit, getting hard to fake it
'Cause I can't take it anymore, so give me something sacred
I played the part of the villain, but no apologies given
I came right back to the start, now, it's about time for livin'
I've been to Hell and back still, I've paid the devil his bills
And now I'm coming back stronger, and I'm shooting just to kill

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I walk into obsession, makes the world go round
We're made up by the people we surround
So we live in times with shit we don't need
Well, maybe it's the price of envy

[Pre-Chorus]
With these eyes, I look out for me
But everyone fades in ways we don't see
Nothing's gonna change, why? We're going down in flames, so?
I'm not the one, don't wait for me

[Chorus]
'Cause I won't just sit by while you just bleed
Myself and others dry, don't wait for me
To be there in the end when you don't see
The truth, you just pretend, don't wait for me

[Verse 2]
What is the solution, we already know
There's no telling how far this could go
No! You're near your time, but you just don't see
'Cause you're just part of this game

[Pre-Chorus]
There's nothing you can do to save yourself
You leave your life in the hands of someone else
You'll never let it go, why? It's the only way you know, know!

Song Description: Coming right out of the intro, Nothing on My Back is a pop-punk banger about being tired of people putting their burdens on the narrator. The lyrics seem to describe something that happened between the narrator and the person hes describing.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Was happiness a fad?
Or was it in the lost and found again behind the issues?
It might not be so bad
We're all addicted to our tragedy, I guess it's what it had to be

[Chorus]
With nothin' on my back, it's still enough to bring me down
Mind's about to crack 'cause what I thought could not be found
Matter of in fact, it's harder still when you're around
Nothin' on my back, I can't help but drown
(Switch!)

[Verse 2]
I might as well belong to both of you
And the mess you always seem to drag me through
That night, forever always haunting me
But I guess it is what it's supposed to be
But spare your thoughts of sympathy

[Chorus]
Nothin' on my back, it's still enough to bring me down
My mind's about to crack 'cause what I thought could not be found

Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Last call for regrets and defeat
To finish the bottle full of empty dreams
Punch-drunk headed straight out of line
Another excuse with no alibi
Hitching on the road of decline
With no-name streets and no vital signs
I pissed away the best of me and
No one can help me! (Help me! Help me!)

[Chorus]
I'm misery's best friend, deadbeat on a dead end
A bag full of regrets and I'm coming clean
The self-elect resident reject
A bad habit, don't forget that you better

[Post-Chorus]
Count your last blessings, I fell off the wagon
I'm chasing six feet, and now I'm running out of time

[Verse 2]
My hands are tied and nailed to the cross
I'm looking for all the composure I lost
I'm petulant with a bad attitude
A poster child vision of wasted youth
I dodged the book and found the key
I can't say the same for dignity
I pissed away the best of me and
No one can help me! (Help me! Help me!)

Lyrics:

[Verse: Steve Jocz]
The seas have parted, the ending's started
The sky has turned to black
A killin' spree through eternity
The devil stabs you in the back
It's midnight now, you must escape somehow
Torture is his leisure
Don't try to hide, he'll make you subside
As he exchanges pain for pleasure

[Chorus: Steve Jocz]

You say you're a pacifist, instead you wave your fist
And all the while it becomes the end again, blegh!

[Verse 1: Stevo32, Brownsound, and Bizzy D]
Nevertheless am I dressed for the occasion
It's number 32, now here's the situation
If the beat moves your feet, then don't change the station
So pack your bags 'cause we're leaving on a permanent vacation
Well, I'm a disaster, a microphone master
Put on the tape, I'll rock your ghetto blaster
It's not about the money, cars, hotels, or resorts
About sweating all the bitches in the biker shorts
I'm Hot Chocolate, and you'll see me running late
Cause I'm always making time to make your girlie feel great
And I'm Bizzy D from way downtown
I'm known to rock a mic like a king with a crown
When I'm on top, I'm gonna borrow that bootie
Hustling deals like Micky Macoote
When I wake up, I like a pound of bacon
Start off the day with my arteries shaking

Rock! It's what we're all about!
It's what we live for, c'mon and shout it out!

You see me in 3D, I'm comin' live and direct
With a dialect most men in science can't disect
Thoughts interwoven, and let us interlock
So now it's my thing to blow off steam and get my cream

And every time we spit it the world panics
I maybe lost my mind, well I ain't through the coop
But Sum 41 just ain't about a loop

Release Date: July 18, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-the-jester-lyrics
Song Description: Right after the crash of the carnival of sins in March of the Dogs, The Jester continues with its anti-Bush lyrics, talking about how hes ruining the world and taking control of everything.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
A jester of sorts you stand holding your courts
Over minions on Capitol Hill
In a bath full of blood, I'm alone standing still
Under God you can fire at will, one, two, three, four

[Chorus]
When the devil's angels come to take your life and lead you
To the flames beneath, your headstone reads now
Here lies the dead who was hung by his head beneath us
They're laying in their graves, damnation free-for-all

[Verse 2]
A prodigal son can't undo what he's done
A figurehead of capitol crime
With a light shining down, as you fall to your knees
To repent would be nothing but lies, one, two, three, four

[Chorus]
When the devil's angels come to take your life and lead you
To the flames beneath, your headstone reads now
Here lies the dead who was hung by his head beneath us
They're laying in their graves, damnation free-for-all

[Post-Chorus]
La la la la la la la (Hey! Hey!), la la la la la la la

Deadbeat, six feet dead
Underground
An eye for an eye only leaves us all blind
Going once, twice, there goes your life

[Chorus]
When the devil's angels come to take your life and lead you
To the flames beneath, your headstone reads now
Here lies the dead who was hung by his head beneath us
They're laying in their graves, damnation free-for-all

Title: Rise Up
Release Date: December 12, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-rise-up-lyrics
Song Description: Rise Up is the second single from Sum 41s double album, Heaven :X: Hell. As the previous single, Landmines was a part of the Heaven side, the tonality shifts to the heavier sound Sum 41 has explored recently. The first glimpse of the Hell side sets the tone as explained by frontman Deryck Whibley.

Writing Rise Up I felt the way I did when I first got signed. I felt the pressure and the need to create something great, but I felt so excited at the same time.
- via Kerrang!
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I told you I'd rise up

[Verse 1]
You'd be mistaken if you thought I was gone
'Cause I've been waiting for this moment too long (Woah-oh)
Just to see the worry in your eyes
I bet you thought that I had fallen away
It never crossed your mind that there'd be a day (Woah-oh)
I'd return to look into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't pray for me, you said there's no hope in forgiving
You're happy to just leave me for the dead
Well, time has passed, I'm very much the living
And all that's left is to leave you seeing red

[Chorus]
So when you think you've got mе by a thread
You need to think again
'Cause I know you nevеr thought this would be how it ends
I told you I'd rise up

[Verse 2]
I don't believe that you have got any soul
You're just a breed of your own kind all alone (Woah-oh)
An architect of your own decline (Your own decline)
Nothing's sacred anymore, that's the past
It's falling further even more out of grasp (Woah-oh)
You're replaced and running out of time

No prayers from me, you see, I'm not the one you think will
Just let it go and leave it all behind
You're dead to me and I don't even feel guilt
Just take a look 'cause it's time for me to rise

[Chorus]
So when you think you've got me by a thread
You need to think again
'Cause I know you never thought that this would be how it ends
I told you I'd rise up
I told you I'd rise up

[Bridge]
I don't wanna close my eyes
I can never get enough

Up in smoke pop goes the culture, the tension blew it up
While choking from my bleeding ulcer, we eventually threw it up

It's long gone, we lost it long ago
Apathy plus-sized filled the void of motivation
I can hardly breathe at all

[Chorus]
Confusion's all I see, frustration surrounds me
Solution's bid farewell, sedation? What the hell?

[Verse 2]
I broke the mirror to the past to find what I was looking for
The bleeding heart of broken glass is all I found and nothing

Title: Eat You Alive
Release Date: July 19, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-eat-you-alive-lyrics
Song Description: The shortest track from Order In Decline talks about the thoughts of someone whos done many things wrong, and how theyll end up, with no way out or to survive. This song is probably also about President Trump and the mess hes gotten into.

Eat You Alive also segues from Never There. The segue is a huge contrast, since Never There is one of the lightest tracks on the record.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
So can you tell me what you've got inside
Well, is it all those fears that you hide?
'Cause it's all messed up now in my mind
Tell me how you think you'd find
Your uninhabited piece of mind

[Chorus]
You always gotta pray for the pessimist
And these days seem the strangest existence
Now make way and obey all the best of us
Before they just eat you alive

[Post-Chorus]
No explanation, greatest of ease, no hesitation
You alive
Desperation, like a disease, justification
Den of thieves

[Verse 2]
Cut you down a bit to size
You know there's no way out or to survive

Song Description: Subject to Change is an unfinished version of No Reason, which is evident considering the numerous lyrical and musical similarities between the two songs.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
How can we fake this, and take anymore
Looking up blindly and try to ignore?
It's better to miss it, there's no point of view
It's only a problem when it happens to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, thanks for making this so easy
What's the point if it's so easy?
Why the fuck is it so easy?
What's it, going to take?

[Chorus]
'Cause we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you
And we'll be just fine, 'cause we won't be bought and sold
Just like you

[Verse 2]
Lies in the sender when nothing is true
Don't be surprised when it comes back to you
Are you on a mission to lose all control
Or waiting for tragedy to unfold?

[Pre-Chorus]

It's too late, we can't change what has now begun
We act like it's not right, why are we pretending?
We've been wrong for so long, we've known this all along

You created these problems, and you don't know what to do

If you only knew what time will tell
It's all a test and lessons that you can't learn
You'll know when you spend your time in hell

No one will be listening, not even when you shout

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It's about time I call up to meet you
Don’t say it's too late to make a move
I know what us two could lead to
Heartaches, good sex, and some bad tattoos
All night, I'm out on a mission
Let’s say we meet up at 4 a.m. 
I don't know what I must be thinking
I keep telling myself to

[Chorus]
Get out, get out, get out
You'll never make it
I know, I know, I know
She's gonna bring me down
Too late, too late
I can't escape it now
'Cause I don't think that I can trust myself
I will screw it up right now
And don't we make a great mistake?
And all really I know is time won’t wait

[Verse 2]
More nights that I can’t remember
And more days that seem like they'rе just a blur
You’re like a brand-new advеnture
In some ways, I feel like you're just the cure
I'm not just playing the victim
'Cause these days and nights, they all just repeat
I don’t know what I must be thinking
I keep telling myself to

I will screw it up right now
And don't we make a great mistake?
And all I really know is time won't wait

[Post-Chorus]
Time won't wait

[Bridge]
All night, I'm out on a mission
Let's say we meet up at 4 a.m. 
I don't know what I must be thinking

Title: King of Contradiction
Release Date: July 18, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-king-of-contradiction-lyrics
Song Description: Another fast political anthem, King of Contradiction takes another hit at Bush saying how hes going to leave office soon in 2009 and be replaced by someone else.

The outro is a lot softer in contrast to the rest of the song and serves as a quick transition to the romantic Best of Me.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I've dethroned the king of contradiction or were you just a
Jester all along, a simple pawn? Don't you know you
Can't count your tears like your money running down the
Drain, the drain!

[Chorus]
You don't need to pray for me, 'cause I'm not the one to blame
I can't wait to see you going down in flames
Could it be? No, not what we became
You lost the human race

[Verse 2]
I hope you burn like a cigarette in ashes as your head comes
Down and crashes, your throat pours blood from slashes
And I hope you never forget like a tattoo of regret this
Time, this time

[Chorus]
You don't need to pray for me, 'cause I'm not the one to blame
I can't wait to see you going down in flames
Could it be? No, not what we became
You lost the human race

[Post-Chorus]
Now you're replaced now, was nice to know you now
Your time is up so...

Title: Time for You to Go
Release Date: March 23, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Sum-41-time-for-you-to-go-lyrics
Song Description: Time For You To Go seems to describe Derycks final moments with now ex-wife Avril Lavigne, documenting their peaceful break-up in which both parties left on a good note without causing a scene.

This was the last song written for the album with the recording taking place on April 7, 2010, at EastWest Studios in Hollywood, California. The song, co-written by Matt Squire, was added to the album at the last minute and its recording was funded by Deryck Whibley himself, as the label refused to pay for any more songs for the album. Todd Morse said on the albums making-of documentary, Dont Try This at Home, that the songs style was more in the vein of classic rock and straight-up-rock and roll, taking influence from the Rolling Stones and the Beatles.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Going in alone, did my time, and now I'm done
It's so easy
All the faces that I see don't mean anything, at all, to me
But you got me going now
Out of my mind, and it's a hell of a time, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't want to say what I don't mean
But I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm sorry girl, it's time for you to go

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you everything that you know you never wanna hear
'Cause it's true
I'd give you all I got, but there's nothing there that you could use
So you've got me going now
Out of my mind, and it's a hell of a time with you now, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't want to say what I don't mean
But I'm trying just to let you know
That I don't wanna cause a scene
But I'm sorry girl, it's time for you to go

The times have changed and so did I

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Deryck Whibley]
I never told you how I felt
Though I thought I'd said it all
And I never knew you needed help
Well, 'cause you always seemed so tough, uh
But now I'm here alone
Without you by my side
If only I had known
That you kept it all inside
Now I'm trying to understand
Just trying to find a way
But forgive you, I just can't
It's all just too much for me to take

[Chorus: Deryck Whibley]
And if I failed you, well, I swear I tried my best
But now you're gone, so all your tears can lay to rest
Just so you know
You meant the world to us, I know that it's too late
And all I want's another chance, I can't accept that you have left

[Verse 2: nothing,nowhere.]
I would have took the pain from you
If only I had known what you were going through
They say that time will heal these wounds
But every day gets longer without you
And the days just go by
While the nights fade to black
Like catching fire

Hear the down and out

And I can't keep it straight, so

All these thoughts are in my head and I'm just hanging by a thread, yeah
I guess I could use somе help

(Guess I could use somе help)

[Verse 2]
Counting the days since I felt all right
I've lost track, giving up, but it's no surprise
Don't tell me everything will turn out fine
Nothing bigger than the little things in life
