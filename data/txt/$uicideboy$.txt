Artist: $uicideboy$
Artist Description: Hailing from New Orleans, $uicideboy$ are a rap duo of two cousins: Scott Arceneaux Jr. and Aristos Petrou. However, many personas are used in place of their real names—for example, “Ruby da Cherry,” “$uicide Christ,” and many more—each having individual meanings. The full list and breakdown of these aliases can be found here. $B are currently signed underground rap record label, G*59 Records.

The boy$‘ discography ranges from horrorcore glitch-trap–working with heavy bass, gloomy atmospherics and drugged-out rhymes. They began in 2014 by releasing the series, “Kill Yourself.” The cousins layered their twisted raps over short but snappy tracks, releasing albums and EPs in 2015; such as Black $uicide, Grey/Gray and YUNGDEATHLILLIFE.
Ruby has not always been a rapper. Before the era of $B—Ruby was a drummer in a punk-rock band who went by the name of Vapo-Rats. During an interview with No Jumper a few years after leaving the band Ruby explained his reasoning for his choice to depart from the group. During the interview, $crim said,

He was going hard with it, he was running everything.

Ruby followed with:

I had to drag, like, three other people with me. They wanted to get fucked up. People aren’t hungry anymore.

Meanwhile, $crim began DJ'ing at thirteen after his mother bought him a mixer. He started creating music and playing at parties which led to hosting mixtapes with Chopper City which did not last long as he was stealing money from $crim. This leads $crim down a different path by creating beats and sending them to artists' email. This was funded through his nine-to-five and drug dealing. However, $crim was fired due to his exotic tattoos.

After $crim’s dismissal from his job Ruby approached him to form a rap group together. Since both of them share the same hatred, they made a pact: if $B flopped and they didn’t reach commercial success, they would both commit suicide. They explained this in an interview with Mass Appeal:

This [is] our last chance, there’s no second option, if this doesn’t happen by the time I’m thirty, and that’s pushing it, like, I’m blowing my head off. No offence to anybody that works a nine-to-five, but I just can’t fucking do that all my life.

Aristos continued:

I know that this is the only life I get and I’d like to leave my mark.

Often $B incorporate samples or lyrics from famous old-school southern rappers like Juvenile, Koopsta Knicca and Lord Infamous. Lil Wayne, who is from their hometown of New Orleans. Their lyrics are often compared to those who were involved in the early Memphis scene, those of which typically depict a nefarious, drug-orientated nature. The duo reflect their New Orleans upbringing in their slang and in their annunciation.

After a brief hiatus touring and focussing on some self-improvement the boys both released statements on Twitter teasing fans of new music now that their tour is complete.

In 2019 $crim checked himself into rehab and has continued his sobriety as of November 2024.  $crim had psychosis, affecting music—which fans began to notice. In an interview, he said he didn’t like the album I Want to Die in New Orleans.

In early September of 2020, it was announced that Juicy J and DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia had set out to sue the duo for afer accusing them of illegally sampling 35 songs. Despite having worked together on tracks such as “Choke Hold” from Juicy J’s album SHUTDAFUKUP, which $crim produced, and Carrollton where Juicy had provided the tag:

Play me some of that $uicide pimpin', man

The boy$ have continued to make music, releasing albums: Stop Staring at the Shadows in 2020, Long Term Effects of SUFFERING in 2021, Sing Me a Lullaby, My Sweet Temptation in 2022 and New World Depression in 2024. The duo also released the fifth instalment of I No Longer Fear the Razor Guarding My Heel and EPs YIN YANG TAPES: Seasons (1989-1990).

[Verse 1: Ruby da Cherry]
They figure me a dead motherfucker
But I'm just a motherfucker that wanna be dead
Snow Leopard with the lead in his head, turnin' me into a sweater
Bitches use me as their fucking bedspread
I be the silhouette of a sunset
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
Stare into the violet fluorescent lights, makes me violent
I'm tryna get the highest I can get before I overdose and die
My ribs are nothing but an empty cage, black hole in my chest
Big bang, Yung Plague on the tip of a wave
In my head, I feel like I'm a guest, so I'ma throw it all away
Because when I am dead, I will be nothing decomposin' in a grave
I'm matter, but I don't matter
I can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter

If life's a game of inches, then my dick has been the biggest
And my goal's to fuck the world until that motherfucker's twitchin'

Lyrics:

[Intro: Haley Gibby]
Letting a new day begin
Letting a new day begin
Letting a new day begin
Hold to the time that you know

[Verse 1: Yung $carecrow]
Locked in my room, four black walls
Tie the noose, no recall
No resolve, fuck withdrawal
Rather shoot up 'til I fall
Murder on call with the *59
Twenty years, and it seem like a lifetime
I been hanging every day from a lifeline
While these fuckers had a dinner every night time
Smo-, smokin' that dope off the foil, let me ball
Ho, please don't call, don't fuck with y'all
Spray paint the walls with blood and whatever
Drag you outside, let you rot in the weather
I don't think I can explain any better
I'm $carecrow the terror and live for the lesser
My birth was an error

[Verse 2: Lord of Loneliness]
I am the Lord of Loneliness
I'll hold my breath, just spoke with Death
He said he hopes for the best
Told him I'm ropin' my neck
Then I woke up chokin' from the hole in my chest
Somehow I manage to function and hope
Every day got a lump in my throat
That's them pills swallowed whole
Smoke a blunt and then fuck all these hoes
End up humpin' they throat
Get the fuck away from me, I hate all of you, faithfully
This world was never made for me
Thankfully, I'm trained to see past all the lies, the ranks, the scenes
I'll shank my knees, then walk the plank and freeze

I wanna take your fucking life, and end it right on sight
When I strike, if you bark, better bite
Block hot, fuck the cops, pop a six-shot Glock
Then I trot to the rocks, with me own blood clot
Red-dot, bodies drop when I cock, then I spot
No tomb, no plot, throw 'em off of the yacht, undocked
With the slot of the skull hangin' in the fuckin' river, ho

Stole it from a cop because he popped another brown kid (Ayy)

From my grey serenade, make way for the Plague

Still got the cash, bitch, I burn it for fun

Sleeping deeper through the night, so I can face my demons
(My!) weakness seems to be that I cannot stop breathing
Death keeps cheating on my life, but on my soul, it's feeding
(It goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on)
Leading to the fleeting of an endless dream
Screaming and needing, yelling and pleading
That things ain't as they seem
In the cut, sneaking and tweakin'
Because I can't stop seeking this pain, this torture of horror
That I'm always conceding

Hard to swallow when the hollows enter through your throat

The pills, the X, the smoke
The rope to choke the pain away, I'm broken til' I croak

Yeah, here's a couple bucks

Roll the blunt, I'll take a hit
Start staring at the smoke, as it twists and disappears
Peer pressure don't affect me, bitch, I take drugs on my own
Pop a perc' and snort some coke

[Intro: Dilbert, Orlogin & Cold Crush Brother]
Must one person's triumph be another's humiliation?
Of course
Call me
Call me

Ayy, another day waitin' for death
Every day that I waste on my list of regrets, so I tell myself
"It's okay, day after next, we'll make all these arrangements to change, you can better yourself" (Uh-oh)
I know I'm wasting my breath as I inhale
I know I'm escaping my death as I inhale

Step into the mind of a Cut Throat
Empty streets, cold weather, all alone
Blackness, grey air, just snow
Feelings low, bein' followed by crows
Call list overflowed with hotlines
Drug help, mental, suicide
Feel tired, feel dried, and you wanna die
Pride fried, closed eyes, and you start to cry
Swear I spent a lifetime tryna get it right
Still isolated, still outta sight
Keep my dreads swingin' like they in a fight
I just wanna kill everyone in sight
Take the money, take the bitches, take the drugs, take the gold
Baby, let me decompose
Never names said, more shade spit

Lyrics:

Questioning my decisions (Decisions)
Burning down all the bridges (Bridges)
Dig a moat, now I'm finished
Sorry, don't want you to visit, no
No
One last pic and I'll be gone
Make it count, put the flash on
Never really felt like I belonged
So I'll be on my way and I won't be long
I'll be dead by dawn
I'll be dead by dawn
I'll be dead by dawn
I'll be dead by dawn

Shit I left unread
Never tryna deal with that

Ten dope dealers
Ex want me to see her
Can't trust her, don't believe her
Reply, turn into a needle, yeah
Don't wanna do it again
Got shit I'm not tryna relive
Head fucked up and I'm sick
These old habits will kill me quick
Quicker than I can blink
Quicker than I could think
Lift me up, don't want to sink
Pour me up, I need a drink
What the fuck do I do
When sabotage is all I know? Oh

Ruby wrestles several devils in the 7th Ward
But Ruby can't afford to move towards the horde just yet
7th Ward Dragon with a fiery sword through the neck
Engulfed in flames, engulfed in blood
As it rains from the red heaven that Yung Plague has escaped
Levitate over Lake Pontchartrain

Lyrics:

Can't hold a conversation with no one but my cousin
He tell me, "Don't worry, the money is comin'
These bitches is coming"

The only question I got now, will I see it before I end up dug in the ground?
Lay low at the bottom of a tulip bed
They know Ruby got a lot of useless thread
Cut me open, let me rest, there ain't nothin' in my chest
A hollow cage that caused my death
I'm hauled away, just pause my breath

[Verse 2: Yung $carecrow]
Woke up dope sick wit' a cut wrist
Lil' bad bitch saying, "Here's a plot twist
When you cut it, you weren't even a little pissed
Just a grin on your face, sayin', 'Watch this'"
Now I'm sittin' back, thinkin', "How sick am I?"
But that went away the moment I got high
I'm saying now, "What it do, who are you?
Get the fuck out my living room
Get the fuck out my mental too
What, bitch? You can't hear when I talk to you?"
Now I'm back to square one, with my hand on the gun
Mama screamin', "Son, don't do it, I love you, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it"

Lyrics:

Joe smokin' motherfucker, don't come around me with no vape
Got yo' bitch under the cover suckin' on me like a bae

Take a Bic, and then I spark until the blunt evaporates
There ain't no debatin' with $uicide, two deep when I ride
Ruby gettin' high off of the pills that I supply
Just cruisin' by on flat tires in an '06 Chevy
Looking like I'm Bloody Mary, sippin' codeine and berry
I'm Donnie Darko when I spark up and I'm creepin' like Frank
Raisin' that choppa right at your face, and after that I go blank
'Cause $lickity off the hinges, with syringes, shootin' up my veins
Rather be left alone, I don't care to know your name, ho

Pull up in a Lamborghini just so you can see me
Swerve into a telephone pole, my skeleton broke
Pirellis smoke and burn
Put my ashes in a blunt and light the front, your vision's blurred
You might just learn how Ruby da Cherry has seen the world
Watch me flex like I'm in the next life
Bitch, I was next in line for heaven
But then I ingested a double cup full of that fucking insecticide
Insects inside my dead body, ironically, after Oddy was identified
Possibly gotta be specified, 'cause the weather was intensified

Song Description: The $UICIDEBOY$ consist of two members, Scott Arceneaux Jr. and Aristos Petrou, who both do vocals, however, Scott produces the tracks along with rapping. They dont use these real names while rapping and dont have a definite name individually. Although, many personas are used to fit the tone of the songRuby Da Cherry and $uicide Christ, along with many moreeach having individual meanings. Here is a full list of these names.

As Ruby explains in their 2015 track Everest, they use the appropriate name to fit the tone of the song:

Snow Leopard or Yung Plague
We both the same
It just depends on what Im dealin' with

They also kill off old persona names using lyrics. For example, Oddy was a popular persona Ruby used, especially in his older days of rapping; On RUNNIN' THRU THE 7TH WITH MY WOADIES, he kills off the Oddy persona:

I murdered this bitch named Oddy, yeah I shot him

and in Either Hated or Ignored, in which Ruby kills off Yung Snow:

Sing a sad ass song for Yung Snow, puttin' in hours at the morgue

Title: DIEMONDS
Release Date: June 15, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-diemonds-lyrics
Song Description: The melodic and wavey DIEMONDS serves as the opening track for the boys 14th EP: High Tide In The Snakes Nest.

Throughout the song both Ruby and $crim describe their hatred for life, love for drugs, suicidal intentions and devilish tendencies.

With long intervals between verses the pair give us an insight into their mind and life from their perspective.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Ruby da Cherry]
What I hate most in this life is a long night
Four walls and no calls, and no lights
But the moonlight creepin' through the blinds
Ceiling fan on high spinnin'
I'm beginning to believe that tonight is the night
Dead by dawn
I'll shred my palms to the end of my arm
I'm spread and gone, embalmed
Put me in the dirt where I belong
Existence is overrated anyway
Fifty years later, they won't remember you're dead
Six billion people living as civilians, and I hated them all
I should have been a vermillion reptilian living in a swamp
(At least I'd have scales to protect me from the pain)

[Verse 2: $lick $loth]
Enter the void with my wrist shackled up
Codeine and water that fill up my cup
Visuals glisten when I get fucked up
Rehab's for quitters and I don't give up
Cockin' the nine if you wanna act tough
This all by design, I don't have any luck
When it comes to them dollars, don't make me get buck
Hollow tip showers when I go and bust
Tell me the reason you wanna be us
I'll tell you good riddance and then get the fuck
Used to fuck bitches in back of the bus
Nothin' has changed, bitch, I'm still bustin' nuts
Always complainin' 'bout bitches and love
When I don't feel nothing, no, not even lust
Triple six demons, in Satan we trust

Title: 122 Days
Release Date: September 7, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-122-days-lyrics
Song Description: The melodic and emotional track 122 Days is the fifth song on I Want To Die in New Orleans. The title refers to the 122 days $uicideboy$ spent on their first world tour. It features a sharp verse from Ruby, followed by a catchy chorus, transitioning into a reflective verse from $crim about his upbringing in New Orleans. The track ends on a similar chorus, all set to a light and visionary beat, offering a refreshing change from the heavier tracks earlier on the album.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Lord Of Loneliness]
Uh, local boy makin' fuckin' global noise, yes, I came to destroy, ayy
Sold out shows 'round the globe twice, now I feel like a fucking Viceroy (I do)
Never say no to whatever drugs, I always enter the void
When it is time that I die, make sure I'm buried in FTP corduroy
$uicideboy$, most avoided, most ignored, I like their old stuff from before (I do)
Who am I, Freud?
I'm not who I thought I was anymore

[Chorus: Lord Of Loneliness]
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
I don't want the life you live (I'm not)
I don't want the wife and kids (Like you)
I don't want to die and miss (I'm not)
All the things they said around me (Like you)
I don't want the life you live (I'm not)
I don't want the fucking kids (Like you)
I don't want to die and miss (I'm not)
All the things they said around me (Like you)
I don't want the life you live (I'm not)
I don't want the fucking kids (Like you)
I don't wanna die and miss (I'm not)
All the things they said around me (Like you)
[Verse 2: Banny Da Pint Drinker]
Ask me if I'm happy, stupid motherfucking question (Hold up)
No pity needed fightin' grown men, I was seven, was sad then
Runnin' drugs up on my bike, you know I had a weapon
Then them drugs became my obsession
Nobody can say they gave me a fuckin' thing (No)
Got out from the mud, now I'm a G-O-D, hold up
Born Southside, West Bank livin' legend
Reborn Yung Christ, this your fuckin' day of reckonin'
Northside Shawty off the porch, sippin' dip

And when I wash it down, you know what it's with (Bitch)

Title: Exodus
Release Date: June 15, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-exodus-lyrics
Song Description: Exodus records Ruby and $crim referencing the Book of Exodus in the Bible, serving as the ending track to High Tide in the Snakes Nest. Ruby compares himself to God using his lyrics, from referencing the Ten Plagues in the intro, Osiris, and a nod to the book of Isaiah.



$crims verse marks him equaling himself to Jesus and Satan. He switches his vocals from high to lowwhen he raps in a deep vocal tone; he personifies Satan in his lyrics. But then, when he switches back up to his raised voice, he goes back to embodying Jesus. This may also be him switching personas, from Yung Christ, and back down to Pontius Pilate.

While the boys both adapt screamo vocals at the start and the hook in between the verses, the fast, god-like rapping and clever references make Exodus a heathens classic.

The main sample in this song is taken from an obscure live performance of American composer Dino Mancino. The clip starts at 1:44:

Lyrics:

[Intro: YUNG PLAGUE]
First, I turned the Nile River into blood
Then I released the frogs as the city floods
Along with lice, flies, and I diseased your livestock
Then I make sure the boils grow on your wife and child
Look up at the fucking sky, you'll see a storm of hail and fire
Then I sent out the locusts to swarm your fucking crops
I blacked out the sun and made time stop
Next I'm coming for your firstborn son, watch him drop

[Verse 1: YUNG PLAGUE]
Bitch, I'm Yung Plague, here to spread the flames
Makin' it fucking rain alligator fangs
Lightin' the flame that ignited the revelation of Osiris
I'm risin' above the horizon, I blackened the diamond
And siphoned all of the water supply of Zion
Bitch, I cut the head clean off of the lion
Put it on a spike, and all of the sheep became enlightened, bitch
I'm standin' right beside Poseidon 'bout to release all the Titans
Footprints in the sand, followed by a herd of rotten bison

Standin' in fire, I'm God of the liars
Attire is made up of nothin' but wire
The choir is singin' my praises with phrases that let you all know I'm the bastard of Satan
Black in my eyes, homicide on my mind
With that blood on my face, then I turn it to wine
Yung Christ the divine, make them fall into line
Let the planets align as they build me a shrine
The end of the world as you know it
When I'm up in hell, I turn fire to snow, bitch
The waters, they swell as the polars are broken

[Interlude: Bloody Mary]
"In New Orleans, there were many bizarre things I always saw growing up here, especially in the graveyards. And as a child, I spent a lot of time in the graveyards. As an adult, I still spend a lot of time in the graveyards. But, as a child, it was a regular weekend thing to do—I always needed to know why. Um, sometimes my 'whys' got me in trouble."

The only thing I ever did worth mentionin'
Ever since $lick burned me a CD of Lil Wayne
That shit prolly still in my boombox

And then smash in the back of a new cop car

Creator of the movement; creator of the music
Still feel like I'm losin'

Used to make me less upset, and—

[Interlude: Compilation Version]

[Verse 1: LIL NO FLASH]
Sold out shows, but I don't believe in souls
So I doubt these shows gonna leave me feelin' whole
A couple blunts, I blow, and now I'm idolized, a role model
That'll get 'em to get me to model clothes
I'd rather snort up Roxys 'till that dope bottle rattles
Nope, I'm not about to tackle yet another problem
I'll have to put this one at the bottom
I feel like fucking Sodom and Gomorrah, but life is sweet
Another black petal fallin' down right at my fucking feet
Another flower rotten, a bouquet of efforts
Sour scents are haunting my defeat
(Sold out funeral, no live nation fee)
Captivate a hunnid-thousand people, still me and the reaper meet
A hunnid-thousand want to meet you, I hope they'll let me be

[Chorus: Koopsta Knicca]
Damn, I'm about to bust a cap up in these trizzick's crest
I'm thinkin' deadly, and I'm scopin' with that infrared
Kickin' with the hardest click, nigga bodies rottin' up in the ditches
Man, what's a bone when my tone hits like a ton of brizzicks?
[Verse 2: LIL HALF CUT]
I'm able to paint a picture most people can't even see
Basquiat mixed with Monet when that heron in me
Self-critic that's speakin' in cryptic, defying the laws of physics
Let me be specific, sadistic, mister pessimistic
$lickity $loth, the motherfucker they call the antichrist
Used to dream of fans chanting, screaming that "$uicide"
Now I get on Instagram, and they posting my personal life
I promise it's not what it seems, climb up just to fall down a stream
Drag me to the river
The richer I get, the worse my liver gets
No strippers on my zipper
Still in my room, keep it dark as I can
Remember scrapin' up change just for cigarettes
Immortalized $uicide, no, they won't forget

[Outro: Koopsta Knicca]
Damn, I'm about to bust a cap up in these trizzick's crest

I froze up and shivered off the shards of cold weather with no effort
Leather belt around my throat feels so better than the rope I had before
The results are the same, but now I'm comfy when I go
I got hoes that burn their wrist with the blunt they rolled for me
And now I'm always stoned, always home alone
In the back of the Benz, I got my squad, I know
But I only see them on the road
And the rest, I know just wanna use you

Snakes in my face, yeah, I think I'm Medusa

Title: Audubon
Release Date: May 26, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-audubon-lyrics
Song Description: Audubon is the opening song off of $UICIDEBOY$ KILL YOURSELF Part XII: The Dark Glacier Saga.

Audubon Zoo is a Zoo located in New Orleans, Ruby and $crim most likely use this to refer to how New Orleans is hectic and violent, much like a zoo. This echoes Rubys opener to his verse,

Ruby da fucking ape
Ruby da fucking orangutan

Later mentioning another animal:

kangaroo the next lane



The song uses a sample from Vibrations by Curren$y & The Alchemist.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Gangland]
New Orleans is ruled by thugs even more ruthless than LA's most violent gangs
Yeah, the Crips and Bloods tried to establish themselves here, and these guys killed 'em
Simple as that, gone, see you later
We look at gangs like this, it's like a coward move to us
But a gang, it take fifteen people to get in two cars and do a drive-by and kill one person
In New Orleans, I just saw one person kill fifteen people

[Chorus: Juvenile, Who Boy Who]
You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remainin' a G, until the moment you expire
You know what it is, to make nothin' out of somethin'
You handle your biz and don't be cryin' and sufferin'
You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remainin' a G, until the moment you expire
You know what it is, to make nothin' out of somethin'
You handle your biz and don't be cryin' and sufferin' (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: Who Boy Who]
Definition of the livin' dead, got a dead bitch givin' head
Tulip flowers growin' on my bed, rust and blood settle on my lead
Broken soul, but I'm breakin' bread, head-dreaded boy from Waggaman
Petey Pablo shirt off, on 'em, swingin' like a helicopter
Got it coverin' this chopper, spittin' out them yoppas
Got the drama with the llama, I can get you to Nirvana

I'm up in flames, the Soulja by the lake
Feelin' like I'm in the Navy, but I pull up in the tank, ayy
Sippin' the tang out of an AK, kangaroo the next lane
Lame move, you lookin' plain, can't redo the flex, mane
Camo on my body like I just got back from the war
I heard a bang in the bank, Ben Frank on the floor
Back in New Orleans, now everybody wanna score

Title: Ultimate $uicide
Release Date: August 28, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-ultimate-suicide-lyrics
Song Description: Ultimate $uicide is the thirteenth track of the $uicideBoy$s 7th full-length album Eternal Grey. The title is a reference to the song Ultimate by Denzel Curry, another force in the underground scene, who grabs a feature on this track. A member of the rap ground Raider Klan, Denzel is joined on this album by fellow Raiders Yung Simmie and Chris Travis, who have spots on 275 $uicide and Water $uicide respectively.

$uicideBoy$ previously sampled Denzel Currys song Threatz on Cherry P.I.E. from their 2016 project Dark Side of the Clouds.

The beat originates from a much older song called Demon$ by $crim, which featured on his album, Patron Saint Of Everything Totally Fucked, an early solo project from him back in 2013.

The ding! sound heard throughout the song is sampled from the first-person shooter Kingpin: Life of Crime:

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: YUNG PLAGUE]
Bitch, I'm Yung Plague with the AK steady sinning
Fuck life, and everything that fucking comes with it
Put the barrel in my mouth, blow my fucking brains out
I don't give a fuck about anything, now I'm finished
Never killed a motherfucker, but that's 'bout to fucking change
Throw my ass in jail, and just let me fucking decay
The world is fucking grey, I grip the fucking blade
And carve a line across my neck, and now I'm fucking saved

[Verse 2: CHARLES LEE RAY]
Bitch, I pull up in that motherfucking donk
Florida to N.O., we down to catch a homi'
Bipolar switching, twitching, now I'm Tony with the Tommy
Demonic logic, I might vomit from popping narcotics
Biologic product of a savage, my mama's psychotic
Here to abolish, killing trees with the touch of my finger
My shadows linger, the crypt keeper, it's $carecrow the reaper
Burning infernos, I'm eternal, these fuckboys just verbal
G-R-E-Y, hear the war cry of thousands that's burning

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
My T is black, hell is dark, and so is my heart
But it's switchin' like the nigga with the Yu-Gi-Oh! cards
Against all odds, eyes on another when you go against god
The ultimate is watching, so I guess I'm in charge
And if you think that you're hard, then I'ma act retarded
Why you ride bikes? Better off in a car bitch
I'm off it, stop, then I'm back in my starship
The ultimate martian in the hood when the hood is lookin' like hobgoblin
Steady mobbin', push it to the limit, I could talk about Ross, bitch
Know a couple niggas that can afford the apartments
Back from BLVCKLVND so I'm black and I'm heartless
Shots in the dark, I'm an excellent marksman
Chop a choppa down, come around with karma
That's why a nigga vibe when a nigga want drama
But I wish a nigga would like Cosmo and Wanda
No Timmy got a long black Jimmy
Smoking on that season milli and the plug is outta Philly
And I still tote the semi when I'm runnin' through the city
Like a motherfucking renegade
Reminiscing 'bout the violence of my old days
All black, bring it back to my old ways
Closed case, kill a nigga like a young Kane, my nigga

Title: King Tulip
Release Date: September 7, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-king-tulip-lyrics
Song Description: King Tulip is the 1st track from the $UICIDEBOY$ long-awaited album I Want To Die In New Orleans.

It is a follow up to their 2014 track Prince Tulip, from their early EP, KILL YOURSELF Part IV: The Trill Clinton Saga. The song bears a striking resemblance to the 2014 $uicideboy$ classicnot only are there multiple references to early $uicideboy$ music, but a similar drum pattern can also be heard, along with a lo-fi scratchy record player effect played throughout the song.



The sample heard throughout the song comes from Grupo Encuentros Cuesta Blanca. The clip starts at around 18 seconds in.

https://youtu.be/beJn4H6H-V4?t=18

However, $crim most likely found this sample through DEVILISH TRIO and their track IDEAL GOD, where the song is also sampled.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Max Beck]
They changed so much, you know what I'm saying?
How did these two motherfuckers, from New Orleans
How did they change, how did they change music?

[Verse 1: Ruby Da Cherry]
Yeah, I was the wave, but now I feel the tide pullin' back
Ocean flat, often I lay in this coffin, sleep on my back, toss a couple of 'em back
My liver really startin' to slack, and I can feel myself decayin' from the cigarette packs
I haven't thought of suicide since I was livin' in the back of Blackout's pad, my heart torn in half
Now I've got everything I ever wanted, but now I don't want it
It feels like I'm haunted, it feels like I'm cursed, hopefully soon I'll return to the dirt
A material world with a virtual nerve, yeah, I'll see what it's worth, throw me out on the curb
Leave me behind, walk a straight line to hell, as y'all swerve away, lost in the choice not to sell
Roll me up a blunt, ayy, I need to get lost, ayy
All y'all talkin' 'bout sauce, I'm wipin' frozen cuts with frost
I'm slicin' open guts, and tossin' frauds off to the side, half of suicide
A couple million, now we're ready to fucking die

[Verse 2: $lick $loth]
Two cups and a bad bitch, then I pop me a Xanax, quick
Call Shake when I need that fix, call Nick when I need that itch
Call Krez just to pop on 'phetamine, Max Beck in the back, pop seventeen
Yung Kurt Cobain with the heroin, $lick love drugs over everything
Shoot the stars up in my veins, woah, but look at your bankroll
So? Just spend it on more dope, more woes, fuck you care for?
But lately, I feel guilty, I feel so badly
They say I made it, and that should be satisfactory
Lately, I feel like I have nobody
All alone in a empty hotel lobby

Title: 10,000 Degrees
Release Date: September 7, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-10000-degrees-lyrics
Song Description: 10,000 Degrees is the fourth song off of the long-awaited I Want To Die In New Orleans, and marks a shift to a more buoyant track off of the more somber project.

Over a grainy and vintage resonance, Ruby slips into his Yung Plague persona and delivers a lyrically confounding verse. $crim raps about his psychopathic traits, insomnia, and drugs alongside the low-pitch guitar chords built around the sample.

The songs title pays homage to the Juveniles album 400 Degreez and Lil Waynes album 500 Degreez. Both artists are New Orleans hip-hop legends, and both are huge influences on Ruby and $crim.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Lil Nut, Yung Plague & Lil Choppa]

[Verse 1: Yung Plague]
Straight outta hell, ring the bells, Plague is here to stay
Roaches and locusts, they cover me
No halo hoverin', follow me in your grave
Ain't got no Patek because I'll be here 'til the end of fuckin' times
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done and still you wonder, "Who am I?"
I am the devil's son, born and raised
Preachin' suicide, googly eyes, "Tell me more," okay
Praise the fuckin' devil, God can suck my dick, I scorch the plains
Makin' mountains crumble, glaciers meltin', oceans swellin', I'm Lord of the Plagues (Load up my—)
Wait a fuckin' minute, I got more to say
Threatenin' swordplay, some would say nay 'cause the tip of my sword blade dipped in chlordane
Lord Plague breakin' fortés, $carecrow in the corn maze

Plague is cold in Norway hangin' from the doorframe with the sores and stain

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know (aye!)

[Verse 1: NORMAN ATOMIC]
Shawty, I don't mind, but you're always on my mind
Think about you all the time, think about you all the time
Where the fuck was I when this relationship dried?
I was probably high to realize you left my side
I will finally give out and die, finally give out and die
I would love it if you bring me flowers, if you come by

Release Date: March 3, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-kill-yourself-part-ii-lyrics
Song Description: The boys reboot the infamous Kill Yourself series (the first song they ever made as $uicideboy$) for part two, and with movie references and an allusion to basketball, they dont disappoint.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: JAMES $PLEEN]
They figured me a dead motherfucker
Calling me James $pleen without a cause of death
I be the Reaper with the black hood on his head
Yung $now with the blood-red sled
Puppet Master, bodies hangin' on a thread, motherfucker
Got a grey blade tatted on my wrist
I don't really need to cut it anymore, and I don't really need a bitch
Let her rot in the hole, months later she was found
Just a skull, she was missin' all her bones
Got her headless skeleton hangin' on my wall, looking elegant
Black suede element, packing blades, lacking Benjamins
Horns on my head, looking like the tusks of a grey elephant
Looking for my medicine, pluckin' the bud off of a nug
Roll it up in a blunt, now I feel fucking dead again
Looking for a place to belong, so I say, "Fuck God, fuck the motherfucking president"
Address the American residents
With just a knife and the help of a relative
Yeah, that's $lick $loth
Both of us buried, "Ruby da Cherry" under a criss-crossed cross
Covered up with a little bit of moss
Looking like a glossed-out Yung Jack Frost
Paid the cost to be the boss, now I ain't fucking dead
But my life has been lost, uh

[Verse 2: $UICIDE CHRIST]
Isn't it so convincing how I'm breathin' down yo' neck?
Junkies in the back, loadin' up the TEC
Fuck her one time, now I'm done
Homicide any time for the thrill
One, two, three, four pills
You know a junkie can't afford to get ill
See me? I don't fuck with you suckers
They call me the shooter like I play for Rucker
Smokey on Friday, they call me Chris Tucker
I swear on my life, I don't fuck with you fuckers
$uicide, cock it back one time, and I shoot it
Keep it lowkey, always gotta keep it moving
Bitches be worried 'bout what I am doing
'Cause they love $licky so much all because of my music
It's the MAC with the gat, that goes click-clack
Shoot a motherfuckers back, brains go splat

Title: Leave Your Things Behind II
Release Date: September 11, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-leave-your-things-behind-ii-lyrics
Song Description: The sequel to the first Leave Your Things Behind released in 2015 features a similar sample as the firsthowever, it is reversed and chopped to bring on an even more melancholy track then than the previous one. Alongside this sample is a relatively obscure sample of Lux ft. Bamiyah by English DJ, Mishkka. Ruby touches on his struggles with himself and suicide, whilst $crim focuses more on his struggles with a girl that was in his life.

This track serves as the 14th and closing track to Eternal Grey.

The start of the song is sampled in Cuffed Up by Quavo and PARTYNEXTDOOR.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Bamiyah]
There's a sense of meaning, in the nonsense that you say
There's a sense of meaning, in the nonsense that you say
Crazy I subliming, as my heart becomes your prey
Crazy I subliming, as my heart becomes your prey
There's a sense of meaning, in the nonsense that you say
There's a sense of meaning, in the nonsense that you say

[Verse 1: Lord of Lonliness]
Allow me to collect myself, I'm all over the place
Put my brain on the shelf, throw me away
(Throw me away)
My hands always hiding my face, never knew why
I guess it's 'cause I feel erased, sever new ties
I'm best when I feel I'm replaced
Get the glue, might have to clean up this mess tonight
Black skies, not a star in sight
That's why I get scarred from light
My demons escape to the place where there's blue skies
They leave me behind with no trace, get the noose tied
My neck snapped, and my body hangs in the new light
The end only comes when it's time

[Verse 2: Yung Lowdown]
Baby, I've longed to see you
Baby, can't think of nothing but you
I'm caged in, walls cave in
Sinking I, I can't swim
Do you think of me when you're fucking him?
Do you think of...
(Fuck!)
'Cause it's only you I want
I'm hurt, and I can't front
Seems like I can't get enough of you ripping me apart
You got me broken and on my own, hopin' you call my phone
Wait, you're blocked, 'cause I'm trying to move on
To be frank, I fell in love with a ho

Title: Avalon
Release Date: May 21, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-avalon-lyrics
Song Description: Avalon is the second single off the $UICIDEBOY$ third studio album, Long Term Effects of SUFFERING, following Aprils NEW PROFILE PIC.

The tracks title is an island paradise in Celtic mythology. It is the location where the Sword of Excalibur was forged and where King Arthur was taken after he was fatally wounded. However, $crim and Rubys lyrics starkly contrast the beautiful island  on the track, the two graphically rap about violence and their sexual endeavors while flexing their monetary and material wealth.

Release Date: October 30, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-i-no-longer-fear-the-razor-guarding-my-heel-ii-lyrics
Song Description: The dismal, heavy-hearted yet deterministic I No Longer Fear the Razor Guarding My Heel II is the second installment in the fan-favorite EP series, following the first I No Longer Fear the Razor Guarding My Heel. It was released on Halloween in 2015.

It features three songsconsistent with all of the other releases in the seriesall played as one song.

The subject matter within this EP is largely consistent with the majority of their discography, focusing on their drug abuse, addiction and their current emotions as well as their state of depression. On the final song of the EP, CLYDE (I Hope At Least One of My Ex-Girlfriends Hears This), the subject matter turns toward their floundered relationships, and the disdain it has caused them.

Cock it back and put the lead, grrrah, grrrah! Let it rain
Overdosing rookies, I'm the bookie for the fucking devil
Jacket full of metal, in the flames where the $carecrow meddle
Every time I smoke on the dope 'till my lungs choke
$licky keep that rope on my throat, hangin' off the oak
Bodies in the river, feelin' bitter with a spotted liver
Send a killer quitter, pull the trigger on the fucking mirror

I'm at large, I'm a sad sap tryin' out feeling good
All these cunts with a fat ass talking 'bout my nut
Got the last laugh, but only as long as the last laugh
Grey flags, so your death mask half-cocked
Shawty blast, so these hands pop gats with the blast
At last, the moment has passed; I got a gash in my thick skull
Throw me in the trash, call for a pickup
Death over bitches all because of Krystal
Blood spillin' in my motherfucking pimp cup
Used to love the bitch, now she suckin' other dicks
So I cut my fucking wrists, feel like a puddle of piss

But generally, all my ex-hoes become my enemies
And my next hoes will deal with jealousy
From a couple chickenheads, Tori and Sophie
Couple of them bitches that ain't important
If pussy curvin' was a sport, they'd call me Jordan
With my endorsement remaining dormant
When it come to these bitches that play informant, ayy
All the girls I done fucked with got kids or ex-husbands
They junkies or strippers, but hey, I'm not judging
Don't fuck with a hippy bitch, fuck with a skinny bitch
Fuck with a needy bitch, fuck with a greedy bitch
Nah, I can't do that shit
Too much energy, energy spent unsuccessfully
Oh, please just let me be one of your memories39Embed

Drawn to the shadows, call me Shadowkhan
Crawl to the gallows, now the shadow gone

Yeah, I got the cut on my neck, now that bitch wet

Umbrella for the tears and the red rain coming down my eyelids
Hate this showbiz, hate all this fame shit
Vanish away like SpaceGhostPurrp did
Either that or blow a hole through my head, shit
'Cause things ain't what it is, everything's switched
It's like I'm watching a movie, and I've seen the end

Title: That Just Isn’t Empirically Possible
Release Date: February 14, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-that-just-isnt-empirically-possible-lyrics
Song Description: The track title That Just Isnt Empirically Possible is a reference to the all to common trope of those who are outside depression telling those who are depressed to cheer up or look on the bright side. The song title is referring to the feeling that you know nothing will get better in your life and that it doesnt matter what you do to stop it, it is just not something that is not possible. This quite obviously is a general nod towards Ruby and Scrims depression and especially serves to reference their continuation of these feelings since their come up.

It is also a quote from the 1990s movie It, from which they may have taken inspiration for the title of the song:

Snag the cash in spite the fact I smashed your bitch for asking nice
I'm passin' pipes and glass and spikes, I bag the ice
Ignite the rags in gasoline, one strike of the match
And now we talking thrice, three strikes

Every time I think of death, I start to groan and crack a smile
Never gave no fuck about this life—and that's me keepin' it mild
Killer gorilla, maniac, put they ashes on my blunt
The police keep hollerin', "where they at?"
Buried them in front the lawn
The $carecrow with silent weapons, I pull the trigger and disperse
The bodies get dumped in acid, so they have no need of a hearse

Listen to the sixes hissing, tipping crucifixes
Missin' pieces in my wrist, it seems I'm sleepin', chest beatin' ceases
Ridin' in the Cadillac with cataracts, lungs black and chapped

Title: Coma
Release Date: September 7, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-coma-lyrics
Song Description: The 9th track of I Want To Die in New Orleans Coma tracks Ruby and $crim describing their death and subsequent descent into hell. Ruby suffers an overdose, while $crim commits suicide.

Ruby also slips into his Yung Mutt persona while using his verse to rap about his ugliness, murdering cowards with his sword, and touching on his sloppy drug-taking. His verse ends about telling the listener a story of his death.

$crims grievous verse takes on a more solemn tone, where he brings up topics of drug abuse, suicide, and hinting at nearly overdosing.

A popular duality listeners have discussed is the similarities between this song and a 2016 track by the boys featuring Ramirez, ASHTRAYthe song features an almost identical bass pattern, a similar hook sample and a murderous, medieval-sounding melody.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Playa Fly & Yung Mutt]
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, ser-serve on, now you know I'm out here hard
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, ser-serve on, now you know I'm out here hard
Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay
Serve on, ser-serve on, now you know I'm out here hard

Creepin' out the cut with my yams, now I want some hay

[Verse 1: Yung Mutt]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who the fuck was that ugly ass boy I saw?
Yung Mutt, what a dumbfuck, dirty like a dump truck
Such a fucking bum, hauntin' sluts guts
I'm disgusted, I'm busted up
What the fuck did I just put up my nose?
I'm buggin' out, knees buckle
I'm duckin' out, I'm in trouble
Now I can see the clouds, lights out
Now I lay myself to sleep, now that I can rest in peace
No questioning my misery, my deathwish granted blissful sleep

Internal decay for eternity

[Verse 2: $crim]
I can't lie, lately, I been on the fuckin' edge
Pistol gripped up on my lap
Xanax, heroin, bunch of meds
Fantasizin' about death, just need one in my temple
Put the gun up to my head
Fuck this shit, I shot the lead and now I'm dead
Descendin' through hell, nothin' but burnin' flesh smells
I scream, and scream, and scream
And hear the others yell as well
Oh well, just my luck
Devil opens up to devour me, that was my old life
Antichrist, he has empowered me

Title: Introversion 2.0
Release Date: September 11, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-introversion-20-lyrics
Song Description: The sentimental INTROVERSION 2.0 follows Ruby and $crim looking back on their old days before reaching commercial success, primarily $crimreminiscing on a time when he was a drug dealer and robber.

The track is accompanied by a sample of Swedish producer Mitch Murders track La Morte Della Speranza to make this track a visionary classic. However, the use of this sample was subject to controversy after Mitch Murder indirectly scrutinized the boys' in a since-deleted tweet:

That feeling when a bigger artist samples you w/o asking or giving credits & proceeds to sell it on iTunes

This isnt the first time the boys' have been criticized for uncredited samples.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: NORMAN ATOMIC]
Barrel full of gasoline, and still, they try matchin' me
Plague with the wicked ways, it's back to the rapturing
Actually capturing souls in a black canteen
Open the cap, and become blackened
Back to the back of the 'Lac, flickin' cigarette ash
Got a chain made of crack, I smoke diamonds
And laugh at y'all strapped with the gat
Like I'm actually scared to die
Pull the fucking trigger, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah!
Back to the back, eyes rollin' back
Spent all my racks, spent it on crack
Spent it on smack, look where I'm at
Ain't going back, ain't going back

[Verse 2: ANTHONY MARS]
Got a heart so cold, remember sellin' dope
Remember sellin' coke, DEA pulled me over
Plain cars, plain clothes, I didn't bend an inch, I'm strictly sticking to the code
Few years ago was masked up, robbin' stores
Set 'em up on Craigslist, then robbed 'em at the door
I'm at the bottom tryna eat, I got no hope, fuck

Title: I Hung Myself for a Persona
Release Date: August 31, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-i-hung-myself-for-a-persona-lyrics
Song Description: I HUNG MYSELF FOR A PERSONA is track 2 on the Kill Yourself Part XX: The Infinity Saga, released in mid-2017.

The song features an ominous beat with the boys rapping in a throaty, high-pitched tone, which makes it distinctive from their other songs. The sound is heavily comparable to Koopsta Kniccas sound of the early 2000s, who was best known for his high pitched, sing-song rap style, which the boys adopt in this song. The boys are known to sample and reference Koopsta Knicca in the past.

Only Rubys verse is featured on the official music video for the song, leading some people to think that this is the only verse on the whole song, however just like all their other songs, it features both Ruby and $crim.

The title mocks people who dont believe that the ideals of being suicidal and having depression referenced in their songs to be true, and believe it to be a persona, in other words, just to make them look cool. They parody this to show that this isnt the case and will go as far a length to hang themselves to prove that they truly do feel this way and have the last laugh when people find out they actually did kill themselves.
Lyrics:

But ain't no waving cannons on my block, no

Fuck this music shit, I'm itchin' for a plot, yeah
Ain't no, ain't no fucking digits on my clock, no
I ain't one of y'all, just let me rot, yeah
I was just with Peep in London
Still feel like I don't exist at all, no
Fuck this social gathering
I'ma smoke a square out in the fucking hall, yuh
They told me watch out for the snakes
But they forgot about the plague
And the AK and with Lil Remains
And the AK and what little remains, what little remains

[Verse 2: Lil Remains]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, had to put down the narcotics
But I ain't really stopping, Xanny and Suboxone
Stay up in my wallet, on the block, catch the Glock
Shoes hanging like a cord
Not a tour, 7th Ward
Magnolia brown, Soulja Slim to the bone
Hot boys, prime-time
Dotted line, never signed
On the drugs, can't doze
If I do be exposed, oh no
Chopper city, dead bodies
Alligators, disembodied

Now I'm 28, feelin' more dead than alive

One day, I'll become the same: a pile of ashes forgotten in a vase
Wrap my chain around the base, and then put it on display
Flashing lights, they shine so brightly
'Til there's blackouts every night
See shattered glass rain from the sky
Beware my drip (Ayy), that shit so blinding
White gold blade, on a bright gold chain
Ruby da Cherry been hated, so why the fuck would I not stay the same?
Every step that Ruby take is like he walking on a plank
Let the waves crash down, let them take me to my grave
Ain't no way, my gang ain't grey
Thousands of people are shouting for $uicide to save the day
Roll up in the tank, fuck the fame
Remember my name until your memory fades
Documenting the plague until my dying day

Title: Clouds as Witnesses
Release Date: March 3, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-clouds-as-witnesses-lyrics
Song Description: For track 9 on Gray/Grey, the boys use a sample of Boards Of Canada to produce an eerie nostalgic track about death, drugs and New Orleans.

Clouds As Witnesses references the neglect New Orleans got from the Goverment after Hurricane Katrina struck the city in 2005, the boys allude that only the clouds were to witness the destruction and neglect of the City. The boys reference this in later songs too.

Cosigned by Pouya, this song is what caused the two sides to collaborate on the EP $outh $ide $uicide.
Lyrics:

Hoes go, "Oh no, heard this motherfucker likes to give burials
And I don't know if I want to go with him, he invited me into his home"
Gave her the number to my phone
Told her, dial-up 666 if she needs to get ahold of me
And hopefully, she'll give me a call when she is home, and free, and lonely
Phone rang twice, but I missed both calls, I was hangin' in the hall, toll-free

Title: Eclipse
Release Date: September 11, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-eclipse-lyrics
Song Description: The third track on $uicideboy$ album Eternal Grey this song features Ruby as ROMEO DA BLACK ROSE and $crim as YUNG CHRIST. This is just another $uicideboy$ song with a hard flow, compelling bass, and a very sick beat produced by the one and only $crim as his Budd Dwyer persona. This song is scattered with biblical allusion and personification of natural forces such as waves and hurricanes.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Romeo Da Black Rose]
Catch me in the back, all black
I be that shadow hovering
Just like the shallow end bubblin' up with blood and guts
I used to be known as the "Shark Attack"
But now I'm hot, like the cherry on my bitch's blunt wrap
'Cause I am the wave
Yung Plague the hurricane
I am the wave as I crash on the shore, flooding the trail you paved
Move out my way, bitch, I'm making a stain
Bleach ain't the way to remove all the grey
Hatin' 'cause I took the wind out your sails
Now you dried up and salty, 'cause I am the wave
(I was the shipwreck, but then I sank)
Full moon, hope you don't cry wolf
High Tide in the Snake's Nest, I'm the mongoose
At sunset, you can see the blue sky dilute
As I blow another grey cloud, hanging my noose

[Verse 2: Yung Christ]
Fuck do you mean we not running the scene?
Took us only one year to be underground kings
Straight outta hell with the intent to sell
Y'all been doing this shit since the year 2012
Fuck do you mean when you say you don't see us?
That grey that surrounds you, created by Jesus
But Jesus is me, I'm Yung Christ, I'm that leader
Better be careful when threadin' that needle

Its interesting to note that $crims alias on this song, Anthony Mars is used with Rubys most common alias and not with its usual counterpart, Norman Atomic.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Ruby Da Cherry]
Ruby slipped a roofie in cream soda with a two piece
Ridin' Uzi, ridin' two-seats, slide two cups inside the Koozie
I'm so slumped, I'm so numb

Gotta watch the fucking news, making my debut, stuntin'
Gettin' goose from your bitch too, juicin' up the oven
Yung Ooze, gotta prove that I'm a dime a dozen
Suicidal, so is my cousin
I got a gut feelin' there's a blade up in my stomach
I don't fear God 'cause I know that he just bluffin'
I'ma die one day, open up the gates to nothin'
Heaven ain't an option, so before the buzzards start crunchin'

I'ma keep on sayin', "Fuck 'em"
I'ma keep on sayin' nothing

Title: Matte Black
Release Date: July 29, 2022, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-matte-black-lyrics
Song Description: Matte Black is the second song of the album named Sing Me a Lullaby, My Sweet Temptation. The sample got used to promote greyday collection the 9th of May 2022.
The song is relatively long for the habitual $uicideboy$ song length.

Scrims verse is more of a overall picture of the addictive tendency that he has. Also of his manic depressive self. Hes switching a lot of subjects in this song, like the shaped mind of an addict. By talking first about fucking a girl, then talking about relapsing into opioid, and back to the girl. Sex and drugs are common addiction that people have, hes after talking about his sadness and how he now has money to cope with it, buying land and diamond but in reality he is not and never will truly be happy.

Rubys verse is mostly based on the fact that the more hes getting old, the same hes not able to take care of himself. Hes talking about how much hes a wreck and that nobody should follow him or be with him cause hell bring people down due to his addictions and actions.

Why the fuck you look to me for help?
There ain't an ace in the cards I was dealt
I'm thirty one, still don't know, how to take care of myself
Honestly, I'm scared, that I might melt
Leave behind a bunch of black spots, on a white pelt
Maybe in the next life, I'll come back as a nice belt, Ion' know
There's a fine line, between me and you
The biggest difference is, I'll snort that shit and probably puke
Dodge and juke all the bullshit y'all try and pull me through
But I'm still shinin', baby girl wylin'
Catch me ridin' by, with that look in my eyes
Palms start to sweat, by the way I'm grippin' my .9
Yeah, I'm always on my toes but I'm still the same height
Standin' tall above my grave
Make sure, it's filled with all the people we supposedly saved
Make sure, you throw the plaques in and all the money we made
I can't put them on my wall, that shit just ain't my taste
It ain't my taste, it ain't my taste!
Lil Shawty wanna marry me, I said "You're better off in debt"
If it didn't work out baby, I'll be real hard to forget
German whips and private jets, private beaches to access
Fuck on me baby, I'm still a mess and no that ain't a threat
I ride for my family that's Grey*59
Try and be all I can be and not waste my time
On the brink of insanity, I can't make up my mind
Yeah, I battle my vanity and I think I'm blind

Title: Putrid Pride
Release Date: February 14, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-putrid-pride-lyrics
Song Description: Pretty much in the beginning $rim is talking about how he accomplished so much more than he thought but hes still the same person but more evolved. In the chorus, Ruby and $crim are saying how time will go by so fast so its pretty much saying do things while you can. Ruby in his verse is saying how he wish he did some things in his past while he could. He has done so much already so when hes done hes ready to rest. He deserves it. Both of them do. Ruby is also saying how pretty much nothing will change with how things are in the world. (like things are same old, same old). And how things were fun before they became bad.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Lil Cig]
Northside shawty pull up in a drop-top
3 AM with the night backdrop
Poppin' on pills like I pop cough drops
Multi-millionaire all from my laptop
Slob on my knob until your jaw lock
Came a long way from rocks in my sock
Moonwalk on the block while I'm sipping on Wock'
Took a whole year off and we still on top
Still the same boy that came from Jeffer Street (From Jeffer Street)
Still the best friend that the devil keep (That the devil keep)
Always burning up, triple six degrees (Triple six degrees)
Lock Scarecrow in Hell and throw away the key, yeah

[Chorus: 40 Blunts, 40 Blunts & Lil Cig]

Now you're wondering how come they never listen whenever you're talking
Look who the fuck just walked in
Time to clear the air, fuck that, I'll be coughing 'til my coffin
And in my coffin, I won't toss and turn
Instead, I'll rest, I've earned some sleep
Let me dream of sheep, release me into the deep
Cover up my head with the sheet
As the years go by
The same fuck girls will be fucking the same fuck boys
As the years go by
The same hero you once had has been reduced to a toy
As the years go by
The drugs used to be fun, now they've become a problem
As the years go by
Before your life even begun, now it's coming undone

Not saved by the leader, put a blade to his neck
Told him, "Run away and never look back—that's a threat"

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: YUNG $NOW]
Fucking with the clique? We got a problem
Throw 'em in the dirt and then burn up a fucking dollar
Show 'em what he's worth when he's six feet in the earth
Since birth, Yung Plague been rising up out the bottom
All hail the one with the long tail
Seven-headed dragon breathing fire, make you all bail
All hail to the Frozen Shogun, slice a frozen ocean open
Throw him in and then claim it was all a tall tale (Ayy!)
No treasure in my chest
All that is left is a half-blackened heart that's decaying
It barely pumps, blood stuck in clumps
What I'm paying for pills, all this pain should be numb or delaying
(Ayy!)
That's it!
I've had enough, I'm gonna grab my wrist and slash it
Don't need a napkin, put me in the casket
Ruby dead and bloody, matching with the fucking maggots
[Verse 2: PONTIUS PILATE]
God of the sun, bitch, I shine like the summer
Grippin' the AK hanging out the Hummer
Sent here to make all these pussyboys suffer
Reign over the grey and strike fear with the thunder
I am the darkness and I am the negligent
Now you not relevant, out of your element
Father, forgive them for thinking they testing me
Father, forgive them whenever they rest in peace
Smoke in my lungs, swallowed pills in my throat
My antidote for that murder he wrote
Stuck on this road, I just want to go home
Stuck on this dope, and I can't leave it alone
Knot in the rope, end my life with a slice

Title: All Dogs Go to Heaven
Release Date: February 14, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-all-dogs-go-to-heaven-lyrics
Song Description: All Dogs Go to Heaven is a 1989 animated musical fantasy comedy-drama film that takes place in 1939, New Orleans.

Although made as a childrens movie, the movie portrays and discusses murders, gambling fixing, prison breaks, kidnapping, and retribution, which correlate with the common themes the $uicideBoy$ discuss in their songs, including this one.

It is also well known that the $uicideBoy$ come from New Orleans, further connecting the film to their own background and story.

Other than this, there are no direct connections or allusions between the songs title and the songs lyrical content. Though Scrim has made reference to the cult classic film before on Rotten Souls

You wanna find out if all dogs go to heaven?

Roll up, and I light a fucking match to the gas, no gas mask
Make it splash, and all of a sudden, I'm getting ashes

Mass appeal is real it seems, mass didn't appeal to me
Six-six-six, wrists glisten 'cause of slits
Heads missing, so I split
Driven apathy, actually traffic
No tragic car accidents happen
You're just a fucking blip
It only matters 'cause we're matter scatterin' around a hole that gets blacker

Hold up before I blow up
Give me one more time I can pour up
Got the wheels spinnin', but my blood's thinning
Oddy telling me that it's time to quit it—but I can't, I'll faint
Just one little taste real quick, so I get straight
I'm so in debt with this shit, I can't pay
I'm so in love with this shit, I can't think, mind go blank

Separate, then tell her to go meditate
She got depressed and overdosed, now all she do is vegetate

Title: Tulane
Release Date: September 21, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-tulane-lyrics
Song Description: Tulane is a bass-heavy and anxious track, centered around their experiences of how they survived the vicious streets of New Orleans, and their distaste for the opposition and the police departments of the New Orleans Area.

The tracks title, Tulane, is a direct reference to two specific parts of New Orleans. It foremost refers to Tulane Avenue, which was a once bustling and very prosperous street that has developed into a hub for prostitution and crime.

Secondly, it refers to Tulane University. While Tulane is arguably the most prestigious university of the south and one of the more prestigious universities of the country, its crazy party scene is a huge part of its appeal, as it was named the No. 1 Party School in the nation for 2018.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: YUNG $CARECROW]
Been about a day since I bled in a pine bed
Get 'em full of dread when they find out that I’m dead
Body full of meds, mislead by a pill head
Fucking infrared cocked back, ready for the Feds
Triple six, triple six, rockin' an upside-down crucifix
Luminous lunatic, shredding the bodies
Oh no, I'm not new to this
Satanic bitches that fuck for the ritual
Spiritual visuals, fuckboys habitual
Talkin' that shit, you don’t know, bitch, don’t make me get physical
Walking 'round miserable, smoking that medical
Shoot up a bag of dope
Dependent on chemicals
I'm on a pedestal, neck hangin' from a rope
$carecrow the skeletal, fuck is acceptable?

Bitch, you can never be the 7th Ward Dragon
Fuck NOPD and fuck JPPD, all the white flags flappin'
Ruby da Cherry, what will he do to me? I can't even imagine
Ridin' in a monster truck, AK tucked
47 shots is what the AK pump
I be that lakefront punk with a vacant trunk
Take some when the bass bump
Then I wait for them at the bottom of the pit
You'll be comin' out the fucking bottom of my pit, that's pitbull shit
Red blood drippin' off my fucking pitbull's lips
Triple the digits of six
Six days went by, on the seventh day, I shine
7th Ward diamond minds illuminated by divine signs
Painted by my mind's eye, blankets lyin' on a fine dime

Lyrics:

[Intro: Northside Shawty]
Once you've found the right doctor
And have told him or her about your pain
Don't, don't be afraid to take what they give you
Often, it will be an opioid medication
Some patients may be afraid of taking opioids
Because they're percieved as too strong or addictive
But that is far from actual fact
Less than one percent of patients taking opioids
Actually become addicted
Talk my shit (North, North, North)
Slicky, Cutthroat (North, North, North)
(North) Ayy

[Verse 1: Northside Shawty]
Death addict, my mathematics you can't add up
So tragic, my baggage comes with no back-up
Breakin' patterns; like splittin' atoms, it ain't happenin'
Cycles spin, psychosis wins, the world spins
On my motherfuckin' dick likе a whirlwind
Devilish sins, devilish grins, got motherfuckеrs like
"Here we go again, this motherfucker Scrim"
Can never stop for nada (No), too toxic
Send his ass off to the doctor
Between the Xanny and Suboxones, lost cause, lost hope
He a throw-away-way, way too deep
In this hole where he lay-lay-lay," lay me down to sleep
Northside Shawty ride curb on creep
Northside Shawty don't pray where he eat
But ayy (Ayy), soon, we'll see
A Soulja by the lake buried six feet deep

Like my soul was rubbing against the grain, lost in the same sauce
I would complain but I'm wearing diamond chains
Cost more than I care to explain, uh, yeah
Lately, I've been feelin' out of character
Bitch left 'cause I embarrassed her, but every day
I be like a thousand fuckin' miles away
Blowin' dope, remindin' myself I'm the boss of the Grey, ayy
Boardin' the plane, what the fuck is a holiday?
Dreamin' through the day, what were you saying? My mistake
Fleeting attention, screenshots, and mentions
Wish I still had an away message, forever stressing
Live a life in the day, this a day in the life
I'm still the fuckin' same, covered in spots, not stripes
From broke to fuckin' paid, this the Grey*59

Song Description: Reign In Blood serves as a demonic second track to My Liver Will Handle What My Heart Cant. The boys rap over a sample of The Showboys to bring on an intense, memorable track. A sample of a phone disconnect tone can also be heard.

It may also echo what $crim said in his verse,

The gripper of triggers that haunts all the rivers
The blood is my liquor
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: YUNG $CARECROW]
Poppin' 'em down with codeine in my cup
Bitch, I'm rollin' the 'rillo and burnin' the ounce
Creep through the ground, I don't hear a sound
Burying bodies all over the town
The satanic killer, the gripper of triggers that haunts all the rivers
The blood is my liquor
"Triple six" marked on my grave
Cynical *59, death we crave
Sharpening the blade so the wrist can be shaved
Enslaved to the minds of the fucking new wave
Creep in the alley, the valley of death
Deep in the city of choppers and TECs
I'm deaf to the screams of the innocent; fuck all the citizens
The fucking militant of the infinite punishment
I need a stimulant; give me the coke, I'm sniffing it

Often I find myself staring into space
Bitch, I'm coughing, I might as well air out the place
It is foggy, my enemies taunt me
I am the worst version of myself, no calling for help
Angel of death, please spread your wings
Pacing myself before she takes me away
Blood stains painted on the door frame
Floor made of bones, I'm collecting and I'm storing
All of my sins are burned in my mind
Memory fading, but I still remember the scythe
Body separated from my soul
How it goes when you're always alone
No bitch, no hoe, solo, no phone, no home
Just a grave that I dug with a blanket of bugs
Bitch, I'm naked full of drugs
Fully faded, pull the plug, bitch, I made it with a shrug
I'm aware that I don't give a fuck, hoe37Embed

That motherfucker in your window coming to terrorize
Cold sweat on your flesh, running down your spine
The days are black, I'm steady running longer nowadays
I'm seeing creatures creepin' up and down the staircase
I’m gettin' higher just thinking of Hell's singing choir
Devil for hire and I'm selling to the lowest buyer
The god of liars, Michael Myers, submerging inside a fire
My urges just won't retire, I'm burnin' but never dying, no

Song Description: The first track of the eighteenth installment of the Boy$s Kill Your$elf series of EPs, I Am the Apocalypse sets an aggressively dark tone for the project, making frequent references to satanic imagery and the struggles of addiction.

Sometimes I just need that fix, sometimes I just need that drip

Convinced I'm meant to die with it

Title: I Want to Believe
Release Date: September 11, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-i-want-to-believe-lyrics
Song Description: In the gothic yet dynamic I Want to Believe, the boys adapt a screamo strain to bring on a nefarious classic, serving as track 5 to Eternal Grey.

Both the title and perennial sample throughout the song is an allusion to the science-fiction drama television series The X-Filesspecifically Season 1, Episode 4 of the program: Conduit. The sample is when Fox Mulder talks about the voice in his head. He responds with I want to believe.

Since The X-Files is based around alien and extraterrestrial conspiracies, this phrase is used to explicate Foxs insouciance to the connivance of aliens themselves since his infatuation with them precludes these intrigues.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Yung $carecrow]
I am known
What, what, what, what, what, what—?

[Chorus: The X Files]

Extend my fist and bust his lip, fuck no, I can't relax
Put on my mask and rob the trap, just so I can relapse

Title: From the Beginning of Time Until the End of Time
Release Date: September 11, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-from-the-beginning-of-time-until-the-end-of-time-lyrics
Song Description: On the profoundly anti-religious FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME, UNTIL THE END OF TIME the boys' liken themselves to God, make metaphorical Bible references and use a sample from South Park.

It serves as the ending track to KILL YOURSELF Part XVIII: The Fall Of Idols Saga, where Ruby notably uses the Yung Plague persona, in allusion to the story of Exodus in the Bible where God released 10 plagues onto Egypt.

This is cleverly used as he references this in the song and is all done to liken himself to God. His powerful god-like lyricism paired with disbelief in Christianity contributes to the notion that Ruby must be God himself. Hes very open about his antipathy for religion. In an interview with the No Jumper podcast, he said:

I dont believe in God, even since a young age, I always thought it was a load of bullshit.
Lyrics:

[Intro: The Antichrist End of the World]
"And he will destroy to an extraordinary degree and prosper and perform his will, and he's seen as a sign of the times"
"We are living in apocalyptic times. Global warming and a rising nuclear threat among nations that really scare us—the whole middle east, Quagmire, and Jihad, and all of these kinds of things, these are not easy times to live in"

[Verse 1: YUNG PLAGUE]
Rip out a piece of my rib and give it to a bitch
As the snake whispers to her, "Ruby does not fucking exist"
So I bit off it's head, then I chewed it, and spit it out
Fell to the ground, as I puked up and flipped around
Scales started forming, I think that now I am the snake
I am the one they call Plague
Who will never escape, will forever remain
The Omega, the Alpha, the chosen one sent here to reign
Who saves all the slaves? Lil Plague breaking chains
Jesus Christ was never raised from the dead, he rots away
Burn a church and watch the flames, autumn embers turn to grey
Wooden crosses in decay, the flock of sheep now fucking slain

[Break: South Park]
"Thanks, Tom. Police are requesting that if you see this little eight-year-old boy, you immediately kill him and burn his body—that's all for now."

[Verse 2: LIL REMAINS]
Run up with the motherfucking MAC on attack
Shoot back, gat gat, grrra!—he flat
Leave them bodies where they lay, let they mothers cry and pray
Nina, nina, oh nina, I need you bad up in my life
Them heathens that scheming, they breathin'
Look dead or somethin' like demons, woah
Smash a forty ounce on the cop cars
Prolly just popped 'bout five bars, sippin' hydro, got a bad cough
Indica dripping down the cigar
It's that dope head, drug fiend
Mug mean, lonely
Shut the fuck up, y'all annoy me

Title: 1000 Blunts
Release Date: July 29, 2022, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-1000-blunts-lyrics
Song Description: 1000 Blunts serves as the 4th track of the album Sing Me a Lullaby, My Sweet Temptation, and the sequel to their 2014 track 100 Blunt$.

100 Blunt$ is among the first songs in which the duo use autotune and audible sound effects, which may be the same case as in this track as well. The autotune usage along with the song title makes the songs vibe as if one is going through a trip, high on marijuana.

Title: Planting the Roots Only to Fall Out the Tree
Release Date: May 3, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-planting-the-roots-only-to-fall-out-the-tree-lyrics
Song Description: In PLANTING THE ROOTS ONLY TO FALL OUT THE TREE the boys reminisce on the old days in New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina devastated the city.

As the center of Hurricane Katrina passed southeast of New Orleans in mid-2005, all 50 levees, which were meant to protect the city, failed, and left the town in rubble. The boys rap about the aftermath of the hurricane, and how the residents of the city had very little money and were forced to turn to drug dealing, robbing and killing to get through in life.

The tone of this song is much more mellow and nostalgic compared to some of their other tracks, which are comparably more dark and fierce.
Lyrics:

[Intro: B.G. Knocc Out]
Time's still changing 'cause brothers turnin' into snitches
Time's still changing 'cause brothers turnin' into snitches
Time's still changing 'cause brothers turnin' into snitches
Time's still changing 'cause brothers turnin' into snitches
Time's still changing 'cause brothers turnin' into snitches

[Verse 1: LIL CIG]
I keep on strolling with no control of my thoughts or life (yeah)
Seems like my home has become something I can't recognize (ayy)
Doubters turn to believers, but fuck, I'm not surprised (yeah)
I miss my cousin so much, yet he's still by my side (what?)
Crazy how friends switch it, askin' how they can get a picture
What happened to, "What's up, homie—how ya' doing? Goddamn, I miss ya"
Don't wanna be nowhere else, so I'm making myself create this hell
In the place I dwell, stuck in an open cell
Take me back 'fore the levees fell

[Chorus: B.G. Knocc Out]
Time's still changing 'cause brothers turnin' into snitches
Time's still changing 'cause brothers turnin' into snitches
Time's still changing 'cause brothers turnin' into snitches

[Verse 2: 7TH WARD LORD]
Yeah, I be that 7th Ward Lord with them devil horns
Born and raised in the waves of the storm
The flood has left me wet and torn
The Garden of Eden destroyed by Babylon demons
They poured the chlorine with no warning
Petals on the floor freezing
A world once unexplored, I think I'm Marco Polo covered in thorns
Set my compass to avoid tethered forms
New Orleans is war-torn, I ain't bettin' scores

Release Date: April 29, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-i-miss-my-dead-friends-lyrics
Song Description: The opening track of YUNGDEATHLILLIFE, takes the listener back to a time when they were kids, and some of their now dead friends were still alive, and when how they stashed their drugs in their parents attics.

Got a bunch of baggage
Got a bunch of bags up in the attic hidin' all my bad habits

All the smoke that I be draggin', bitch
I need some caskets for my fuckin' lungs, they fucking damaged
Like the Black Flag, classic Sabbath? Never heard of that shit
Bitch, I work, it ain't for assets
Roll a solo blunt, no matchin'
It's because of all the gadgets why I keep a social status
Fuckin' phones and tablets, bitch, I do this shit just for Jefe
Yeah, he told me, "Make it happen", then he died in that tragic car crash
And every time I think of that I'm flickin' ashes
Yeah, it sucks
When you realize life is fast and I'm a fuckin' cashless organism
Tryna thrive inside a habitat that's plastic

[Verse 2: $lick $loth]
It's that motherfucker that ya momma said don't hang with
Meet me in the gallows, bitch, I promise that it's painless
Stupid motherfuckers thinking that we on the same shit
Cock it back, and then I yell, "Okay, here comes the pain, bitch!"
Up in gangster's paradise, could give a fuck about your life
Every time I roll the dice, sixes popping up twice
Bitches tryna sacrifice their pussy, but I am not enticed
Good try, ho
I do this shit for Dirt, so I ain't got the time, ho

The song is produced by Budd Dwyer, the non rapping alias of $crim from the $UICIDEBOY$.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: RUBY DA CHERRY]
Fuck you, bitch, I'm here all by myself
I tried the belt, but couldn't get it tight enough
So I smoke the blunt, my lungs are rust
My brain is dust from all of these drugs
I can't think straight, I'll walk the plank
Spill my blood so sharks will come and eat me (And eat me...)
—Whole!
In between Hell and Earth, I do the limbo
My body alive, but my mind is dead
Going through the motions, all of them emotions
Dump me in the ocean, I'm drowning again
We don't have to pretend

[Verse 2: $LICK $LOTH]
Okay, here we go, blade to my throat
Whole floor soaked with blood from a goat
Bag full of dope, room full of smoke
All black coat with a wolf for a cloak
Do you feel my essence? Depressing presence
My main goal in death is to blow up heaven
Don't get the message, can't teach the lesson
Just a feeling that you get when you hang with peasants
Ridin' down Crescent, my weapon is oh-so-sharp and ready

Lyrics:

Song Description: Lucky Me is a reflective track, surrounding the infamous 27 Cluba group that refers to the many musicians who died at age 27. These artists include Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse and Jimi Hendrix, to name a few.

This is referenced throughout the song. Ruby and $crim are lucky to have passed the age of 27, which they did as of the release of this album, in 2016. They were born only 10 days apart, in 1989.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: LIL LONELY]
Ruby stay at home on a Friday night
Hoes blow up my phone, tell 'em that I'm quite alright
I might forget that my pimp game is weak sometimes
And if you slip you fall in love—now she gone
Now I gotta ball, flex on Adderall
Sex on Tramadol, I guess I'll try 'em all
As I recollect, the records I collect
Most of the artists wished for an early death
I will give it my all, yes, I will give it my best
Anything to replace all the static in my chest

[Chorus: LIL LONELY]
But I know she won't be home, I feel so fucking broke
I'm lethal, I bleed foam, and seep smoke

Ex on my mind when I start masturbating

Title: Ocean Side $uicide
Release Date: July 30, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-ocean-side-suicide-lyrics
Song Description: Ocean Side Suicide (Stylized as Ocean $ide $uicide) is an early track by the New Orleans rap duo, $uicideboy$. It is the second single released from the Kill Yourself Part II EP, as well as the seventh overall $uicideboy$ song published.

Falling in line with the rest of this EP, the song is largely horror themed. An ominous piano sample is worked into the instrumental, as well as lyrics containing themes of murder, death, and devil worship. It also samples Live by Yo Rep by Three 6 Mafia, and Smoked Out Loced Out by Prophet Posse.

Scrim appears to be experimenting with different vocal deliveries in this song, with a noticeably different sounding voice as opposed to the rest of material $uicideboy$ released to this point. Ruby makes extensive use of rhyming in his verse, ending most of his lines with a word ending with a long-A (e or ) sound, (grave, slaves, blade, etc.)

A music video was shot for this song and published on the G*59 Records YouTube channel on August 20th, 2014, a little less than a month after the songs initial release. A few years later, the boy$ would pay homage to this music video by referencing a negative comment left on it in the music video for The Nail To The Cross.

This song is the most popular from the Black Suede EP, and generally considered among fans a staple classic of 2014 $uicideboy$ music. Due to the prominent Memphis hip-hop song samples, as well as the experimental nature of Scrim and Rubys delivery, its also considered an important step in the development of their overall sound.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Yung Christ]
I got a thousand razor blades, press 'em in your flesh
Take my pitchfork out the fire, soak it in your chest
Slowly creepin' out through my skin
Dead friends on a bunch of tens
Slaughter your body, murder with Oddy
Moderately into photography

[Verse 1: Yung Christ]
Get the autopsy, cut through me
Only to find out that this boy don't bleed
Grab my piece, rest in peace
Just to look in the eyes of the mask
Blast, blast! In his ass, one to the head to make sure he passed
Casket pimpin', killers with minds
Lucifer of my time
Cock that nine, shoot his spine, leave no witnesses behind
Puff that gas, light it up, I'm just waiting to combust
Chillin' in the catacombs, buncha dead prisoners

[Chorus: Crunchy Black]

Fuck all the fortune and fame, I just want to be tortured and put in a grave

Never be cruisin' that wave

I'm a stain

You gon', you gon', die, die—

Hanging out the motherfucking window (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
'Bout to shoot this bitch

[Verse 1: Yung Mutt]
Used to smoke crack, now I count fucking racks
Mack daddy smacked, licking a powder bag
Back on my bullshit, white Benz coupe fit three in the back
And that's not including your bitch too, shit
Mutt hit the blunt like a bum
$lick in the cut with a cut, no, we never gave a fuck
Here I come, suck it up, bitch, I'm fucked
Lead in the brain, I got tar in the lungs
Threads full of stains in my car, fucking slumped
Nothing to gain, I got nothing but bad fucking luck
Lean the seat back as I swerve and I crash
Yeah, there's blood mixed with glass
As my dreams turn to black, I'm ash
Put 'em in the back, no strap in the backpack
Just a bunch of trash
Told Zac, "If we ever fell off with G*59 or FTP
Let's just be terrorists, blow up on NBC"

[Chorus: Koopsta Knicca]
Yeah, you gon' die, ho
Yeah, you gon' die, ho

They don't know whether to pump my stomach
Or stitch the hole in the back of my head

Dig me a hole, I don't need no remembrance
I'm heading back home, yeah, the place where the devil lives

I woke up and then heard the priest say "The devil lives!"

Song Description: The Number You Have Dialed is Not in Service was as vox sample in the track Not Much to Look At with Germ.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Raindrop Walka]
Fallin' apart
You might've thought I was playing a part in the art I've created
But most of the words reflect what's happened or what is waiting to start happenin'
I keep on damagin' myself, tryna fill the void
With all this water 'round my neck, I'm 'bout to drip until I drown
All these drugs up in my nose, I taste the drip, that shit's so sour
All these cars that I bought either don't start or they got impounded
Pursued the American dream, the nightmare's what I doubted
Catch a flight to London or I'll catch a flight to Lyon
Show my face in public, show another one at home
See my name on the marquee, letters falling down
Littering a cold dark street somewhere downtown
Soon as I reached cloud nine, it started stormin'
Heavy thunderstorms in every city that I'm tourin'
Life ain't like a rap video, that's just a warnin'
Hopin' to see the sun when I wake up in the mornin'

[Verse 2: Hearse Boy]
All this misery, misery, misery, fuck
Look at my history, no mystery where I might end up, just shut up
Don't wanna hear it, it's my decision
May be my last words so just please listen
So long, it's been torture bein' here
So gone, getting high been how I cope with fear
Same song and I'm sick of singin' it
Let me move on, it's for my benefit
But come one, come all to my downfall
Bear witness to everything that I can't solve
My therapist made me promise before I end it all
That her phone would be the one I choose to call, crying, asking
"Is it really worth it?
What's beneath the surface or behind the curtain?"
Really don't think I wanna take this any further
Made one last attempt to figure out my purpose
I called her phone, it said not in service

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Lil Half Cut]
Windows down with a frown, ash on my jeans
Been up eatin' beans
These scenes keep on flashin' inside of my head
But I'd rather be dead
Got no bread, outta meds, I can't find no tranquility
Put me outta my misery, insomnia drivin' me mental
So I put on a front like golds on my dental, my life's accidental
At the drop of a pencil, I might flash out and shoot every motherfucker while I'm drivin' a rental
Oh no, don't tempt me, I ain't slept in six weeks
Haven't ate since Wednesday
Goddamn, I'm empty

[Verse 2: Yung Slumber]
I fall asleep, but I don't want to rise out of bed
Escape to my dreams, I hope some of them wet
The sun shinin' bright as I open my eyes
And then close up the blinds, and wish that I was dead
Some people wanna call me a pussy
Some people wanna call me a bitch
Some people wanna tell me that it ain't that bad
"Lift up that chin"
I wonder what they'd say after I slice my wrists
Two slits, I'm gone in the endless abyss
One way street, and I need a fucking lift
If sleep is the cousin of death, I guess me and $lick countin' sheep 'til we outta breath, I mean, shit!

Where the liquor floods, racks in my safe, kept safe
7th Ward by the lake, come and see me

That ain't what he told me
Uptown killers by the river is nothing holy
Except for your white tee, red dots bleedin' in the hot sun
Time to grab an ice tea, survival is unlikely
Gorilla in the tank yelling, "Where they at?"
Reminiscent of the 1990's
Platinum fucking blades, chopping up the tracks
Hoodrats acting fiesty, murder, murder nightly!

[Chorus: 7TH WARD LORD]
If you from the 7th Ward, won't you make noise?

Release Date: August 13, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-if-self-destruction-was-an-olympic-event-id-be-tonya-harding-lyrics
Song Description: Both the song title and the lyric video refers to the American ice-skater, Tonya Harding, In January 1994, Hardings ex-husband had arranged an attack on one of Hardings rivals, and in the same year, in march, Harding pleaded guilty of the attack and hence was stripped of her title.

Hardings story strongly resembles the problems that tha boy$ went through their lives, and how they sabotaged themselves all these times. So in a way, Harding and boy$ have self-destructed their lives.

Deranged from the blood stains all over my brain
Just another day, this killer train is ridin' down your way
I'm fucking starting to unthread, these voices that's in my head
I got a romance with the dead that's sleeping in river beds, uh
Damaging my organs, to me, they just ain't important
I'm a different kind of breed, the one that don't even breathe
The one you ain't gotta feed, just rob and take what I need
Fucking product of the $uicide, fucking spawn of Satan
Cuttin' on my wrist, while these women fornicating
I'm debating to take my life, forsaken by sacrifice
Mistaken for something nice

Pile of ashes is my final form
Got a roll of duct tape, and a rag soaked in chloroform
Flies swarm because my body's warm, shatter the urn
See me blowing in the wind like a scattered storm
Grey matter splattered in front of the corner store
Saw that when I was fourteen, walking around the 2nd Ward
Send him to the seventh floor
Ended up with floor seats to something I didn't want to see

How do I dear deal with all this pressure?
In my way
It’s in my lungs
It’s in my thoughts
It’s in my brain
A guilty conscience some might say, I’m paranoid and locked away
A withering weed in the garden that God wasn't supposed to save
Locked up in an open grave
With a King James' Bible
With a couple quotes erased, but kept the ones that made me smile
Do I really see everything for what it is?
Or is it that I can’t see anything with such a bad case of denial
When I die, then put my body in a boat
And light it on fire, push me out to sea
And let the wind do what I might-a
No matter whatever I feel about anything
It wasn’t until I burned all my bridges
It made my future brighter58Embed

Title: Where’s Your God?
Release Date: December 22, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-wheres-your-god-lyrics
Song Description: From the cover art, (if you dont know who that is, it is John Wayne Gacy. An American Serial Killer who would dress up as a clown at kids birthday parties and molest and murder the children who once came a crossed him.), you will tell its going to be a bumpy ride. This track is about the horrors of fame and how its affected their mind to not care anymore. Though they are not in any way shape or form religious, you are soon to realize that they use Satan and Triple Six (666) to make reference to the Sex, Drugs, Money, and Fame, that they soon didnt realize, would hit them. This song is a dedication to that.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: TRAP HOUSE $CRIM]
Well, it's that triple six, lunatic
Smokin' piff, load the clip
Grab the crucifix, it's an exorcism (666)
I've been hating life
Suicide, who am I? Noose is tied
Closing my eyes is my only mission (Fuck your God—)
It's that $carecrow with no soul
I only ride solo
Please don't take my photo, I hate all you bitches
I'm clinching my trigger, I'm fuckin' your bitches
The graveyard my trenches, trust me you don't want it
I just hit 'em, and kill 'em with hell in my vision
That druggie, that junkie, bitch, give me your money
Blood on my clothes, spells on my soul
Live in hell, but I'm cold
Trust me, you don't want it when I got that motherfuckin' look in my eye
Got six million ways, to commit a fuckin' homicide
G*59 'til the fuckin' day I commit suicide (Fuck it—)

[Verse 2: LIL OOZING]
All the way from hell
Climbing up, and out a well
Blood sells, so I cut my fuckin' neck and sold myself
To the prince of darkness
Souls I harvest, bodies I reap and sow
Turn off the lights, and watch me glow
Back from the dead, had to sew my throat closed
Maggots and larva started to grow
Now I'm nothing but bones in a hole, decomposed (Fuck—)
Fuck what you believe in, bitch
I never had a reason, bitch
I'm comin' from the semen of a demon, now I'm leavin', bitch
I'm bringin' back a screaming bitch

The title of the song appears to refer to the tradition of the changing of social media profile pictures each time the pair release a new album. It was first seen after the infamous I Want to Die in New Orleans was released and all $uicideBoy$ social media platforms featured the album cover as their profile picture. This was followed by their collaboration with Travis Barker in LIVE FAST, DIE WHENEVER and finally Stop Staring at the Shadows before their newest upcoming album Long Term Effects of SUFFERING.

The cover art for this single features a cropped image of a postcard denoting costumes from the 1915 Mardi Gras festival. A world-renowned annual celebration held in New Orleans, the hometown of the pair.

This isnt the first time we see the boys use an image of the festival for their cover art, in their 2018 single Scrape in which they used an image from the Rex Ball, an event held during the celebrations.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Yung Christ]
Drugs in my veins with two ho's on my lap
I ain't gotta roll a thing I got these bitches for that
I got that smoke by the ounce, I got them pills by the bottle
And if I ever run out, this junkie right here will rob ya
Trap-Trap, trappin' out the ocean just so I don't lose focus
I'm always sippin' purple potion, keep them Backwoods in motion
Yeah, I use and I sell
Yeah, I'm straight out of hell
You drop my name in any city, bet it's gonna ring bells
Chop it up quick like a brick, I ain't got time for the small talk
Poppin' up quick, then I dip, see I don't wanna be bothered
Just know I hate you motherfuckers and that's from the heart
Bunch of blowfish motherfuckers and we are the sharks
Ho

[Verse 2: Ruby da Cherry]
Fuck all of y'all, bitch
I don't give a fuck if $uicideboy$ never going to do shit
Still put the pistol in my mouth, blow the back of my head out
Now I'm gonna head out
Slit my fuckin' throat, throw me in a shark tank
Either that or you can leave my bloody body in the motherfuckin' boat
Fu-fu-fuck everything and fuck myself
Fuck what you think, leave me hangin' by a belt
Brain bangin' with the pain, grey stainin' is the game
Flames gainin' my domain
Stayin' in the same lane

See me dancin' in the street when that motherfuckin' blood rains
Everybody else is dealt with

I'm ridin' with a bitch that's high as me
She duckin' out, she tryna sleep
I'm duckin' out, I'm tryna see the road
But all I can see are four horsemen comin' closer to me
I think I'm about to die, we'll see
Swervin' on them motherfuckers, bitch, it ain't my time
Let the world blow up first
Then I might just close my eyes

(I!) see the reaper creepin' as my blood is seeping
Sleeping deeper through the night, so I can face my demons
(My!) weakness seems to be that I cannot stop breathing
Death keeps cheating on my life
But on my soul, it's feeding
(It goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on)
Leading to the fleeting of an endless dream
Screaming and needing, yelling and pleading
That things ain't as they seem
In the cut, sneaking and tweakin'
Because I can't stop seeking this pain
This torture of horror that I'm always conceiving19Embed

Title: Rotten and Paralyzed in a Tropical Paradise
Release Date: June 15, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Uicideboy-rotten-and-paralyzed-in-a-tropical-paradise-lyrics
Song Description: Rotten and Paralyzed in a Tropical Paradise tracks Ruby and $crim recognizing their hatred for religion and how their political views are the opposite of conventional. The title is a nod to how they are still depressed and chained to their problems despite the rich and lavish surrounding they find themselves in after reaching commercial success.



The track is accompanied by a distinct sample of the U.K pop-star Ellie Gouldings song Hanging On, repeating You know we can get away! throughout the songonly furthering the misanthropic and hostile themes of this track. However, the usual $uicideboy$ sample of Three 6 Mafia can also be heardusing an excerpt from their 1994 song Now Im High, Really High with another sample from Shit Popz Off by DJ Zirk appearing towards the end of the song.

It was first performed live at the Minsk, Belarus show on May 13, 2016. It also marks the first time $crims persona Lil 2/3rds was used.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: LIL 2/3RDS]
Fuck y'all- Fuck y'all- Fuck y'all, I will never switch, never change
Take the gold, take the cash, throw it in the flames
Looking deranged, walking 'round with a blood stain
Give me the keys to the Range or the Mustang
Drive that motherfucker off a hill, and blame it all on the pain pills
No devil, no God, but the same feel
Red dot with the mod and the frame filled
$uicide is the name of the free-willed
(You know I got them—)
Bitches by dozen from rappin' with cousin
They say that we buzzing, but I don't hear nothing
But sheep, that sleep, layin' on the concrete
Constantly suffering, but God, do I love it
So fuck it, I'll climb up just so I can plummet
Ashes to ashes, from something to nothing
Give me the casket, I'm kickin' the bucket

[Verse 2: YUNG MUTT]
In my hand, I got a pair of dice
They told me roll a seven, bear in mind, I want a six
I recognize that heaven mythological
And so the pair of dice, swallowed whole
And now I got abdominal tears in spite of theological paradigms
R-R-Rotten and Paralyzed in a Tropical Paradise
I'm about to go Fahrenheit, bitch, I'm poppin' a terabyte
All these parasites a problem in my logical pair of eyes
Politics opposite of innocuous, verified
In the hospital bed, my chronic is sterilized
Televise the terrifying chronicles of enterprise
Possibly is scared of heights
But the obstacle therein lies the prodigal errant fight
[Outro: Lord Infamous]

Lyrics:

[Intro: Brad Pitt]
Tell you a secret, something they don't teach you in your temple
The Gods envy us, they envy us because we're mortal
'Cause any moment might be our last
Everything's more beautiful, because we're doomed
(You did good, $lick)
(It's a Smash)

[Chorus: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Hit me with some-, hit me with some-, hit me with some-, hit me with some—
Hit me with some more but you don't hear me, so I split your wig
Shoot on a trick when I'm thick, slick ain't got no sorrow, bitch
Shoot on a trick, shoot on a trick, slick ain't got no sorrow, bitch
Hit me with some-, hit me with some-, hit me with some-, hit me with some—
Hit me with some more but you don't hear me, so I split your wig
Shoot on a trick when I'm thick, slick ain't got no sorrow, bitch
Shoot on a trick, shoot on a trick, slick ain't got no sorrow, bitch

[Verse 1: Yung Revelations]
Can I ever get a moment to myself?
Each moment that passes is fleeting
I try and I try to escape my own life
At this point y'all should call me Houdini (Oddy, don't)
It always ends up with me bleeding (Not again)
Or so overwhelmed, I'm retreating (Not again)
Back into the hole that I tried to climb out of (Not again)
It always ends up self defeating (Not again)
I'm addicted to sex, addicted to drugs
Really whatever will make me feel loved
I don't care what you think, yeah, I don't give a fuck
I'm still out here shinin' as bright as the sun
No matter how hard it gets, no matter how tough
Don't disobey when I say, "Give me the gun" (Give me the gun)
If I don't let my demons out to breathe
I'll end up with some horns or pair of fuckin' wings
Come and visit me from time to time (From time to time)
To all the bitches I was ever with
Yeah, you're still on my mind (Mind, mind)

The hopelessness, the terrible hopelessness that comes over1Embed

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: $lick $loth]
Pale faces that surround me, eyes looking like round three
Cup looking like nosebleed, only sippin' hydro-codeine
Da$h riding, Ruby sitting shotty
They said, "you see 'em?"—I said, "I got 'em"
Bottom lurkers, snakes out the lake
Ball and chain, ain't no escape
Fuck the fame, I just want the change
Fuck a name, I just want a grave
Spit in your face, Grey be the apes
You sippin' grape? I don't want a taste
Cooking dance when I cook the base
Hit the lace, now I'm feelin' spaced
You see the tape where the bodies lay?
Say you real, but I see the fake
Fuck out of my face, yeah, so?
Am I in love with drugs? Yeah, hoe
All my plugs got a mug on the record
Warzone in the slums like a desert

[Verse 2: Oddy Nuff Da Snow Leopard]
Uh, $uicideboy$ still alive, "why haven't they died?"
17 More Minutes 'till I'm bled dry, gotta get my head right
Tighten up the noose, now my neck tied
No more breath hidin' in my lungs, I'm feeling calmer
I'm the shepherd with a flock of sheep, claimin' they want the slaughter
Fathers sacrificin' they daughters so their sons don't have to be offered up
I often off 'em anyway, 'cause I'm the soul marauder
I toss 'em off and sail away to the devil to barter
Take 'em underwater, take 'em to the altar of Hell
And let them wander while the devil separates the martyrs
Whoever's left will be turned into walkers and crawlers
Wait until the sky is darker, and now they're ready for departure
Ruby da fire-starter, Ruby da one who lets 'em all burn
Screaming, "Ruby, fuck my bitch!"—I tell 'em all to wait their turn
Snap my fingers, now they're feelin' how the flames burn
Then I extinguish 'em, and assume that it's a lesson learned

Yeah so, yeah so
It's a dead man walking, ain't too big on talking
Chalk laying in the places I be stalking
Coughing off the nicotine, living dreams, and coughing
You ever vision me, bitch get the hearse
Doing dirt, check my fingernails
Living swell, throwing hunnids in a wishing well
Vicious sales from all the shit that's being shipped in mail
This some shit I didn't think that I would live and tell
Hell couldn't hold me, the one and only
D-O-double-L-A, ain't into fair play
Do crimes, stack cheddar
Whole grain, nothing better
Shoot first, ask never
No bet, I'm suicidal, homicidal
Grab the rifle
Prolly die of overdose, I'm fucking bitches on the Eiffel
The only time that I'm ever arrogant is outta spite
And we getting high in the area that's black and white
'Cause if you ain't know8Embed
