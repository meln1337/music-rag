Artist: Travis Scott, Alternate Names: La Flame, Cactus Jack, Jacques Webster, Jacques B. Webster, Jacques Bermon Webster, Jacques Webster II, Jacques B. Webster II, Jacques Bermon Webster II
Artist Description: Jacques Bermon Webster II (born April 30, 1991), popularly known as Travis Scott (previously stylized as Travi$ Scott) is an American rapper and producer from Missouri City, Texas, located within the Houston Metropolitan area. Scott began producing and releasing beats via Myspace at 16.

He moved to Los Angeles after dropping out of The University of Texas at San Antonio following his sophomore year, adopting the name Travi$ Scott in homage to his uncle named Travis, and his musical idol Kid Cudi (real name Scott Mescudi).

Travis Scott dropped out of the University of Texas at San Antonio without his parents knowing and moved to Los Angeles to make music. His parents made a surprise visit to see their son at his former university. They eventually found out that he lied to them. They cut off support towards him from that time on. He ended up sleeping on couches and lived miles away from people he knew.

With some help of fellow southern rapper T.I., Scott signed to Epic Records and T.I.’s label, Grand Hustle. After, he acquired the number of Kanye West’s engineer, Anthony Kilhoffer. With Anthony’s help, Scott was able to co-produce tracks on G.O.O.D. Music’s debut album Cruel Summer. After his appearance on the label’s album, Travis signed to G.O.O.D. Music under a producer contract and along with West’s help, he released his debut solo mixtape Owl Pharaoh.

He released Days Before Rodeo on August 18, 2014, anticipating the release of his debut album entitled Rodeo, which was released September 4th, 2015.

Scott released his highly anticipated sophomore album Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight on September 2, 2016, after previewing it the same morning on the .WAV Radio show on Apple’s Beats 1 platform. The album was an Apple Exclusive and was available exclusively on Apple Music for a week before its full rollout on all other marketplaces and streaming services.

Travis' third studio album ASTROWORLD was released on August 3rd, 2018. The album was a critical and commercial success, selling half a million copies in its first week, and peaking at #1 on the US Billboard 200 chart.

La Flame is also the CEO of Cactus Jack Records, a record label that counts Sheck Wes, Don Toliver, SoFaygo, Luxury Tax 50 and Chase B on its roster.

On July 28, 2023, Travis' highly anticipated fourth full-length studio album, UTOPIA was released after an almost five-year wait from ASTROWORLD. The album was released alongside the Bad Bunny and The Weeknd-accompanied hit single, “K-POP.” The album shares several similarities to Kanye West’s — a producer on the album — June 2013, Yeezus which Travis acted as producer on.

Dawg prolly do it for a Louis belt.

Song Description: goosebumps is an eerie love song. Travis and Kendrick detail the unique feelings they have for their love interestsespecially when shes not actually there.

Before performing this song live, Travis says he wrote this song in my bedroom at one of the darkest times in my life. This, combined with the lyrics in the chorusspecifically such terms as goosebumps, numb, and Heimlichhave led many fans to believe this song may have an underlying theme of prescription drug withdrawal.

In addition, Travis broke JAY-Z and Kanye Wests record of performing a song the most number of times in a live show (Niggas in Paris in France 2012) when he performed goosebumps 14 times in a row. Incredibly, he proceeded to break his own record the following week.

The song was first previewed on his Snapchat on April 13, 2018, and has since been performed multiple times live.

Travis released ASTROWORLDs trailer four days before the albums release, which featured the song playing over cinematic scenes of Travis Scott navigating a post-apocalyptic landscape with outer space elements.

[Verse: Travis Scott & MC E]
Okay, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past, you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dawgs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before no car notes, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, that's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds (Alright, alright, alright)
And she hit that booger sugar 'til her nose bleed (Alright, alright, alright)
Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
She was talkin' 'bout forever, got a whole week (Alright, alright, alright)
Plus, she know my baby mama is a trophy
She be throwin' up them B's, feel like we both bleed
She keep my dick jumpin' up, feel like I'm Moby
I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe, yeah
This right here is astronomical
I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible
They tryna say that all my problems is improbable
They keep itchin' at my spirit, I'm diabolical, you feel me?

Title: beibs in the trap
Release Date: September 2, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-beibs-in-the-trap-lyrics
Song Description: Travis Scott enlists up-and-coming Canadian rapper and record producer NAV on beibs in the trap, a standout track from Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight. The song is solely produced by NAV and was originally his record, made before his career started.

The title of the song is a misspelled abbreviation of Canadian singer-songwriter Justin Bieber, who NAV uses to describe the white color of cocaine in the song and even name-drops Bieber in the first verse. It could also be a nod to Nicki Minajs May 2012 single Beez in the Trap, from her chart-topping sophomore studio album, Pink Friday, but it is clearly a huge nod to Travis Scotts album title.

The official music video for beibs in the trap was released on December 28, 2016. Showing both Travis Scott and NAV in a hangar with a person doing donuts in a Lamborghini, its release date coincides with NAVs manager Cashs 33rd birthday.
Lyrics:

[Intro: NAV]
That coca

[Chorus: NAV]
I just poured an eight in a liter
Throw some Jolly Rancher in, make it sweeter
Versace my clothes, I'm with a white ho
And she snortin' three lines like Adidas
Got a black girl rollin' off molly
Got a white bitch snortin' up snow
Say she want real niggas in the party
Parents gon' leave the keys to the condo

[Post-Chorus: NAV]
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose (That coca)
She said she want more, she said she want more
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose
She said she want more, she said she want more
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more
[Verse 1: NAV]
I just poured an eight in a liter
With a white bitch sniffin' on Bieber
Are you sure you wanna party with the demons?
Bitch, lookin' for her phone, I ain't seen it
Told Frost, "Bring the water," no Fiji
Free Stix, I'm poured up and I'm leanin'
I got a couple pussy niggas in they feelings
'Cause the main bitch wanna come see me
She said she want more, your girl is a ho
You need to let go, she fucked all my bros
She snortin' the snow (That coca), now she touchin' her toes
She got Anna Nicole all in her nose
If they kick down the door, we gon' get locked for sure
She said she want more, fuck it, I'ma get more (I'ma get more)

Title: 90210
Release Date: September 2, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-90210-lyrics
Song Description: 90210 is the 5th track from Travis Scotts debut album Rodeo and his self-professed favorite song on the album.

90210 is the postal code for Beverly Hills. On the track, Travis waxes lyrical about the different people living there, notably a porn star girl who prostitutes herself to pay for her lifestyle and Travis' drug use.

About halfway through the song the beat switches up quite a lot. Travis starts rapping about himself in the first person, in contrast to the first part of the song. Part 2 is also notable for sampling Kanye Wests Family Business.

Travis described the overall sound behind the song as trying to capture:

the vibe from when I travel from Texas to L.Athis song is kinda like the vibe, its not aggressive, but its kinda like the drug.

On August 18th, 2016, almost a full year after the release of Rodeo and this song, Travis released the music video.

Title: FE!N
Release Date: July 28, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-fe-n-lyrics
Song Description: FE!N reunites Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti with Travis Scott, following their 2018 single Love Hurts from Cartis debut studio album, Die Lit.

The allegiance of the two introduces a different soundscape from their previously released material, as Travis experiments with higher vocal pitches, whilst Carti does the opposite and adopts a deeper voiceheard on most singles from his third studio album, I AM MUSIC.

A different version of FE!N was partially debuted in UTOPIAs accompanying film CIRCUS MAXIMUS, which features an alternate vocal take from Carti, as well as a complete verse from Cactus Jack Records-signee Sheck Wes.

Though Shecks verse was cut from the final release, both UTOPIAs physical edition and a digital release of the album feature the aforementioned version of FE!N, alongside various other elements of the album tweaked last-minute.

The tracks official music videoentirely shot in a spinning motionreleased on March 30, 2024. The video makes faint callbacks to UTOPIAs cover art, including the black backdrop (featured on the main cover) and a child extra (seen on vinyl sleeves.)

Title: YOSEMITE
Release Date: August 3, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-yosemite-lyrics
Song Description: On YOSEMITE, Travis Scott enlists Gunna and NAV for a slow-moving track.

On the song, Gunna delivers an effortlessly smooth chorus over signature guitar-driven production by his frequent producer, Turbo. Travis matches Gunnas free-flowing cadence on the verse as the duo create an ode to their extravagant lives full of jewelry, private jets, and designer clothes.

The tracks title is in reference to Yosemite National Park, a scenic nature park located in Californias Sierra Nevada mountain range.

Additionally, this track is seemingly somewhat of a spiritual successor to Gunnas April 2018 single Sold Out Dates. At the beginning of his verse, Travis seems to mimic the flow of Gunnas verse on Sold Out Dates, and Gunnas chorus seems to be a homage to his cadence on that song.

Notably, the song gained attention due to NAVs outro, which was originally mixed much quieter than Travis and Gunnas vocals. On August 11, 2018, a better mix, with NAVs vocals turned up, was added to streaming sites, replacing the old version. Many memes and jokes were made based around his vocal mix, with NAV acknowledging the meme in a now-deleted Instagram post.

The songs accompanying music video, which stars Travis and Gunna, as well as Travis as a child, debuted on November 30, 2018. This video showed the adult Travis and Gunna in a plane that says ASTROWORLD, watching the child Travis exploring a jungle, looking for ASTROWORLD. NAV, however, was not featured in the video.
Lyrics:

Title: CAN’T SAY
Release Date: August 3, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-cant-say-lyrics
Song Description: With a winding, hypnotic beat from Wondagurl and London Cyr, Travis cedes most of CANT SAY to Houston newcomer and recent Cactus Jack signee Don Toliver.

Together, the two trade stories of getting high and pulling women.

Furthering the homage to Houston hip-hop present throughout most of ASTROWORLD, the track includes an interlude sampling Fat Pats 1998 verse from 25 Lighters, a song by DJ DMD that also featured Lil Keke, who Travis also references on 5% TINT.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Don Toliver]
No, you can't say if I'm mad or not

And shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off
I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turnin' out
What would you do if you heard I got it goin' on?
I had to burn, I left skrrt marks, I had to dip (I had to)
Gotta watch for 12 'round my town, you might get killed (Better watch for 12)

Title: STOP TRYING TO BE GOD
Release Date: August 3, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-stop-trying-to-be-god-lyrics
Song Description: On STOP TRYING TO BE GOD, Travis cautions rappers to not develop a God complex and to remain true to their roots. The song features Kid Cudis signature hums, vocals from Philip Bailey and James Blake, and a harmonica performance by Stevie Wonder.

This was the first song to be conceptualized for the album and also the one that took the longest to completeit was a year in the making and recorded across multiple studio sessions.

Travis teased the collaboration between him and Stevie Wonder on his Instagram and expressed in a 2018 interview with Billboard that one of his goals for the album was to get a feature from Stevie Wonder:

My next album is going to have Stevie [Wonder]. Well, Im trying. Were talking.

The music video, which came out on August 7th, 2018, was directed by Dave Meyers and loaded with Biblical imagery, tying in with the songs underlying concept.
Lyrics:

You can't win a trophy or a plaque off her
But never turn your back on her
'Cause they did not create commandments
When you hustle, always make it fancy
The signal's far from what you can be
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You won't succeed tryna learn me
Stick to the roads in my journey
Stay out of court when you got the attorney
She say she love, but want to really burn me

[Bridge: James Blake]
Is it the complex of the saint
That's keepin' you so, so, so still still?
Is it a coat of old paint
That's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long since the last
Open conversation you had? Oh, no
And did you see the void in the past?
And can you ever see it comin' back?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?

We up all night, from dawn to dusk, it's always poppin'

I played the drums, she rolled the drugs
I rocked the club, we both throw up
We was the band you never heard before
You got that tat' above your crack
And on your cat, you be right back
Your mama never know
We were rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' stones
When I'm all alone I wish you had a clone
I take that puff, you take that puff
You know we never care to overdose

Title: NO BYSTANDERS
Release Date: August 3, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-no-bystanders-lyrics
Song Description: NO BYSTANDERS sees Travis Scott collaborating with Juice WRLD and Sheck Wes, who was signed to Travis' label, Cactus Jack three days after the track. This song is featured on Travis' long-awaited third studio album, ASTROWORLD.

Juice claimed he really wanted to collaborate with Travis and that he was still stuck listening to Travis' debut studio album, Rodeo.

However, Sheck handles the chorus of the track. The chorus was the most controversial part of the song because it interpolates the chorus of Three 6 Mafias 1995 track, Tear da Club Up 97, where the group raps:

Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up

Travis was eventually legally sued by DJ Paul from Three 6 Mafia for copyright. In September 2019, word spread that the lawsuit was settled by Travis paying the requested $20 million.

Hours before the albums release, Travis used this song title along with other ASTROWORLD tracks, consisting of NC-17, STARGAZING, and STOP TRYING TO BE GOD to promote the album on his now-expired Instagram story.

Title: through the late night
Release Date: September 2, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-through-the-late-night-lyrics
Song Description: Travis Scott links up with his idol Kid Cudi for a song about late nights and partying. This song is the second time these two have collaborated on Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight.

Travis flips Cudis breakout hit Day N' Night during his verse. This is actually the second time that Travis refers to this Cudi hit. Back in 2008, on one of his first musical projects, The Graduates EP with Chris Holloway, one of the tracks was called Day'n'Nite.

Travis Scott has talked a lot about how Kid Cudi is one of his favorite artists. Travis said that Kid Cudi liking Rodeo meant so much to him. About Cudis participation on Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, he told Rolling Stone:

In my whole career, all I wanted was acceptance from Kid CudiI dont care about nothing else! This dude saved my life. He kept me from doing a lot of fucked up shit to myself, kept me on the right path. Thats why I make music, thats why I go hard for the fans, thats why I tell security to move out the waycause this dude gave me the passion, the information, the insight on how to grow up and be who you want to be.
I dont know if he remembers, but the first time I ever met Cudi was the first time I met Kanye. Ive never told anyone this, but it was the same day. That was the first time I was around G.O.O.D. Music at all. I was sitting like, 'Man, Im in the presence of 'Ye and Cudi. This is the art level where I want to be.

Title: MY EYES
Release Date: July 28, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-my-eyes-lyrics
Song Description: MY EYES portrays Travis Scotts life throughout his POV as he raps about the struggles and obstacles hes gone through in his life. Throughout the track, Travis touches on themes of love, material wealth, fame, personal struggles, and the complexities of relationships.

In the first part of the track, assisted by the melancholy and gloomy vocals provided by Justin Vernon, Travis particularly touches on the lack of love in his life despite it being filled with materialistic values which tend to make people happy.

However, in the second part of the track, Travis flips the warm, somber rhythm to a faster trap cadence in which it could be perceived that hes bragging, however, behind that, Travis speaks about his personal view of life, particularly noting that he desires his childhood more than ever.
Lyrics:

[Part I]

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
When I stare in your eyes
You'll be there forever
To watch our life (To watch our life together)
You just like going to Heaven (My heart)
More than anything (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
I'm fallin' and I'm drownin'
But you're takin' me

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
One thousand on my feet, stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes (Eyes)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Rollie Pollie on my wrist
Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' no FaceTime
50K, wonderin' why I'm stormin' off, no race
Emboldened by the bliss
I was sworn in by a kiss
Latе from the country caters
No peacеmaker, I sweep up cases
Goin' on a walk with a new suit armor
New suit dead, Bottega, that's on it
Give me the heat from the sleep, then I harm her
Cupid creep in, sleep with a hammer
Three time to get me T-T-T'd
Still same phone, AT&T-T
Still givin' news very vividly
Beefin' up, fuck a beef
Smokin' on some vicious type of reefer
I need no beef, no cheese (Yeah)
Even when I eat, they cheat (Uh)
Every time we meet, naive

[Intro]
It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me

[Verse: Travis Scott]
Look in my eyes, tell me your tale
Do you see the road, the map to my soul?
Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face
Am I picture-perfect or do I look fried?
All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'
Tell you demise, I went to my side
To push back the ceilin' and push back the feelings, I had to decide
I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a city of people that ride wit' me
If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child
The things I created became the most weighted, I gotta find balance and keep me a smile (Hah)
Yeah, yeah
That shit wild, instead I'm a hero
I took it from zero, LaFlame Usain
I run it for miles, this shit wasn't luck
They got me fucked up, I put you on bus and take you around
A couple of guys inside of the school, I gave 'em the tools to get it off ground
They say they the ones when they make the errors
Can't look in the mirror (That shit wild)
I stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage
No turnin' it down, can't tame it, can't follow it
We do in the streets, we do it for keeps
We do it for rights, got fifty-two weeks
This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak
This shit is forever and infinity
Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around
I take me a bean and I turn to a beast
Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed
Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat
Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat
If I gave you a day in my life or a day in my eyes, don't blink35Embed

Title: MELTDOWN
Release Date: July 28, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-meltdown-lyrics
Song Description: MELTDOWN, a three-part track that sees the tempo of the track rising until it reaches its untimely climax and the end of part one, sees Travis Scott recruit Drake as they both rap about their superiority in the music industry while the artists give themselves a God-complex, fitting with the theme of the album which is against the Devil.

In the first part of the track, Drake takes control as he raps with a cold and raspy cadence, sending subliminal shots to several artists such as Pharrell Williams and Pusha T. However, in the second part, Travis keeps a similar beat and cadence which is later switched in the third part as his rhythm is slowed down.

Drakes appearance on the album was teased by fans on Twitter who were given the chance by Travis to listen to the album prior to its release.
Lyrics:

[Part I]

My schedule is out, come spin us, for real
Man, fuck all that spinnin' the narrative shit

Title: Maria I’m Drunk
Release Date: September 4, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-maria-im-drunk-lyrics
Song Description: Maria Im Drunk revolves around the hazy nights in the life of three super-stars. On Part 1  Maria  Travis personifies weed as a girl. Part 2 -Drunk  focuses on the love all three artists share for women and booze.

Part 2 originally premiered on the Rodeo Tour, which led to feverish anticipation for its release. A few months after this debut, the song leaked under the title Drunk. The leaked version only featured Travis and Young Thug, without the Maria intro, leading to much surprise when Justin Biebers name appeared on Rodeos final tracklist, whose verse replaced the latter half of Traviss from the leaked version. Many fans were surprised to see Justin Bieber rap a verse, but his performance was met with rave reviews.

However, the song was only accessible to those who paid for the album, and was not available on any streaming services until September 2018 when Travis announced it would appear on steaming services:

https://mobile.twitter.com/trvisXX/status/1038030343813513222

There are several theories which attempt to explain the 3 year publishing embargo, including music industry politics, and record labels seeking to remove all of Justin Biebers rap verses.

Another demo of the song later leaked in the second quarter of 2019, featuring the full version of the Maria intro and a different extended Travis verse on Drunk from the first leak.
Lyrics:

Title: 3500
Release Date: June 8, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-3500-lyrics
Song Description: 3500 is the first single from Rodeo and was premiered at the Hot 97s Summer Jam on June 7th, 2015. The title refers to a $3,500 fur coat bought by Kim Kardashian for her daughter North West. It may be hard to make out what exactly costs $3500  the coke? the code(ine)? , but Travis confirmed its indeed the coat on his instagram.

The song was originally slated for inclusion on Kanye Wests So Help Me God in 2014. According to Scott, it had a completely different sounding beat, but the same hook, and was to be a single for West. After West scrapped his vision for SHMG, he gave the track to Scott.

The artwork for the single was shot by Australian director and photographer Nabil Elderkin.

Title: WAKE UP
Release Date: August 3, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-wake-up-lyrics
Song Description: At the time of this songs release, Travis Scott and The Weeknd were in relationships with Kylie Jenner and Bella Hadid, respectively; it is likely that their relationships served as inspiration for this sexually explicit track.

This is the second collaboration between Travis and Abel on ASTROWORLD, following SKELETONS, which immediately precedes this song.

Genius later reported that WAKE UP was originally intended to be a part of The Weeknds March 2018 EP My Dear Melancholy,, but the song was later repurposed for ASTROWORLD because it did not suit the EP.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: The Weeknd]

And the doors goin' up, suicide

Over the biennial amount, roughly twenty-nine African-American youngsters, teenagers, and young adults were kidnapped and killed in Atlanta. Wayne Williams, associate Atlanta native was in remission and condemned for 2 of the murders in 1982. once his conviction the Atlanta local department declared that Williams was answerable for a minimum of twenty-three of the twenty-nine Atlanta murders, although Williams continues to take care of his innocence.

Andr antecedently documented the ill-famed killings on Goodie Mobs food track Thought method, once he rapped, Thought Process, when he rapped, The only thing we feared was Williams, Wayne.

Title: CAROUSEL
Release Date: August 3, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-carousel-lyrics
Song Description: CAROUSEL, presents Travis Scott and Frank Ocean dictating their experience during a day under the influence of a variety of drugs and alcohol.

Big Tuck not only lends his endorsement in the songs intro but also the sample from his song Not A Stain On Me, originally from The New Style by Beastie Boys. It can be heard as the hollering sound panning throughout the song.

Frank Ocean demonstrates his range on the song, featured on the hook as well as his own verse. He slips in and out of the song in a graceful auto-tuned falsetto, but can be heard using his normal unaffected singing voice on the chorus and verse.
Lyrics:

Song Description: ASTROTHUNDER features production from frequent collaborator Frank Dukes and Frank Ocean affiliate Vegyn, whilst also providing Travis' first collaboration with John Mayer and Thundercat.

Song Description: SKELETONS features longtime collaborator The Weeknd and also marks Travis' second collaboration with Pharrell Williams, who is listed as a producer on Rodeos Flying High.

We just rocked Coachella, I gave her half of the check
It was good sex, honorable mention to the neck
(Just let this wash on me)
Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect
Afterwards, pass the towel, I was out of Kleenex (In the memory, standing in the ocean)
If you take a girl out, do you expect sex?
If she take her titties out, do you expect checks?
First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace (Just let this wash on me)
Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked (Feels like slow motion)
Took a church visit, you know, 'cause the world hectic

[Bridge: The Weeknd & Pharrell Williams]
It's like floating, if I can't be in time
I don't know, I don't know (Wash on me, wash on me, yeah)
In the ocean, if I can't be loved
I don't know a sound

Title: I KNOW ?
Release Date: July 28, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-i-know-lyrics
Song Description: In I KNOW ?, Travis Scott portrays an image of what life is like for him when he does drugs and drinks alcohol, suggesting hes tainted and bothered by everyone looking out for him.

In the chorus, the heavy repetition of, I know suggests that Travis is feeling fed up and bothered by everyone judging him for being on drugs, however, because hes so addicted, despite people caring for him, he brushes it off as though he feels theyre not looking out for him.

The track shares a similar cadence to Travis' August 2018, 5% TINT which similarly has a slow, yet fascinating rhythm. While rapping, Travis is backed by a creepy piano riff that follows him through the entire track.

With a lack of autotune  in comparison to other Travis Scott songs  the raw vocals play into the mysterious theme of the song which surrounds the topic of drugs. It sees Travis being honest, however, at the same time, hes in denial about being on drugs.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Tell me, is you still up? (Up)
It's 5 AM and I'm drunk right now
Tell me, can we still fuck? (Fuck that shit)

You said it's just the drugs and I know

Before I had you right inside my arms
But then again, I could be drunk (It's lit, yeah)

Wanna know how pain feels? I got off my main pills
Bet my wifey stay close, she know I'm on my Bezos
Opioid addiction, pharmacy's the real trap
Sometimes I feel trapped, Jordan with no Phil Jack
One year, it's Illuminati, next year, it's the Sunken Place
They don't want me to change, nah, nigga run in place
I need someone else to make this drink, because
You don't understand the juice to vodka ratio
That could satisfy a real drunk, guess what?
Never trust a bartender that don't drink, bitch

Title: HOUSTONFORNICATION
Release Date: August 3, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-houstonfornication-lyrics
Song Description: Much like the rest of the album, this song sees Travis talking about his experiences in the city of Houston as well as relationships and drug use amongst other topics. The title of the song is a portmanteau of Houston and fornication which essentially refers to the act of having sex before marriage. The song serves as an ode to Travis hometown of Houston and the reckless and potentially harmful activities his young self would have engaged in.

A lengthy, high-quality snippet of the song was leaked online on June 25, 2018.  Later, on July 23, 2018, Music Mafia put the song up for sale on their website. Regardless, the song was updated and included on the album anyway.

The title is also a reference to the popular song Californication by Red Hot Chili Peppers. Interestingly, in an interview with Complex, producer Sevn Thomas explained that he even titled the instrumental Californication after it was finished.

Title: R.I.P. SCREW
Release Date: August 3, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-rip-screw-lyrics
Song Description: On R.I.P. SCREW Travis pays homage to deceased Houston hip-hop legend DJ Screw. Screw was integral to the development of the chopped and screwed DJ technique, which helped pioneer the Houston hip-hop scene. Screw died in 2000 of a suspected lean overdose.

To pay respects to Screw, Travis is both literally and metaphorically slowing down on the track in dedication to him.

Travis also pays homage to Houston rap icons Big Moe, E.S.G., and Big Pokey and their 2000 track Maan!!, by following their same pattern of saying man at the end of each line in his second verse. The three artists were founding members of Screwed Up Click, a hip-hop collective led by DJ Screw.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Swae Lee, DJ Screw & Travis Scott]
(Ya know? Southside)
Rest in peace to Screw, tonight, we take it slowly (Yeah)
I'm gonna let you know the move

Title: NC-17
Release Date: August 3, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-nc-17-lyrics
Song Description: The tenth song on Travis' third studio album, ASTROWORLD, NC-17 is the third collaboration between Travis Scott and 21 Savage, after Ghostface Killers and outside.

NC-17 is a term used by the MPAA in the American film rating system, meaning children under the age of 17 are not permitted to watch a certain movie. NC-17 was formerly known as X-Rated. The reason the song is titled after this rating is due to the explicit lyrics of the track. This also relates to the theme of ASTROWORLD sounding like a theme park, as many theme park rides and attractions have age restrictions. According to the MPAA, the NC-17 rating signifies Clearly adult. Children are not admitted.

In a now-deleted Instagram story, Travis posted the title of this song along with NO BYSTANDERS, STARGAZING, and STOP TRYING TO BE GOD to promote the album.

Prior to the release of the album, NC-17 was one of only two songs (excluding the already released BUTTERFLY EFFECT) previewed by Travis, with the other being STARGAZING. It was first shown off by Travis' friend, Oggizery Los, on his Instagram story before later being played at a club by Travis shortly after.

Lyrics:

[Part I]
[Intro: T.I.]
Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system
We find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized
With a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of "Fuck this shit"
At that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch, leadin' the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey
Ain't made it to wherever the fuck they gon' be in life
But wherever it is, it's better than here, so fuck you and fuck this

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surroundin' me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashin' lights—, lights—, lights—
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

[Verse: Travis Scott]
You remind me of my ex, crazy love
We designed our love around the drugs
We both in this club, we both tryna fuck
I'ma rub a dub, tryna get a nut
See Travis Scott LiveGet tickets as low as $277You might also like[Chorus: Travis Scott]
No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surroundin' me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashin' lights blindin' me
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

[Outro: T.I.]
The story of the bastard was never told
The soul of a bastard was never sold
Will he survive or will he fold up?
Livin' like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
Sits at the top, a long list of no named
Misfits can't wait to get a chance to say, "Fuck you"
To the ones who said, "Fuck you"
'Til you doin' your thing, codeine and cocaine cartels
Who leads the charge of this young mob?
"La Flame," he hears in his head, "The world is yours" (Yours, yours)
[Part II]

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes in the farms, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might need to move to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish
[Verse: Travis Scott]
It's the Rodeo, time to get started, Houston nigga goin' James Harden
They was wildin' on us niggas in the projects, wonder why a nigga went cold-hearted
They wanna put my soul up on an auction, but I'ma make 'em take the fall like August
And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus and I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out, askin', could you hold one? Who do I owe? Nigga, no one
They pickin' you up, but you low down, animated actin' frozen
I got porno pics, wish I can post them, stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em
Niggas askin' for the old him, but I'm way too young to be the old him
I'ma make this shit crack Lamar Odom 'til I climb to the top of the podium

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
So wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might move out to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish

[Outro: Travis Scott & T.I.]
We gon' rule the world, we gon' rule the world
We gon' rule the world, hmm
(Never gonna stop, never gonna stop, never ever gonna stop it)
La Flame says, "Let your ambition carry you"

Oh-oh, don't pray for love

Just ask the lonely, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & The Weeknd]
Pray for who lost they fate and died too young, pray for the ones I hate, the ones I love
Pray for my liver when I'm off in this club, I pray that the demons go away, they hauntin' us
Man, I can't take no more of this lifestyle we been livin'
Man, I can't take no more of the white powers in position
Gotta grab up J-Will, gotta scoop up J-Rich, told CHASE we ain't goin' back, you know we gotta hitch
I mean, I'm aggravated, agitated, I admit, intoxicated, animated, got me feelin' kinda lit
Contemplatin', fornicatin', might as well fuck up some shit
They lookin' at me way too crazy, got me feelin' communist
But I'm just tryna save the throne, pray for BONES, pray for Stix (Just ask the lonely)
If my album never sell, then we gon' hit that lick
Tell Lamar, call up Cash, tell him, "Buzz me at the Ritz" (Just ask the lonely)
It's the weekend, we off the deep end, you need to pray for us
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh-oh, don't pray for love

Now I'm thinkin' 'bout this new girl and she doin' pop (Oh-oh)
Wanna know? My dick longer than a Pringle box (Don't pray for love)
Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Underrated is an understatement
They tryna test greatness, a nigga tryna get paid
These niggas fiends watchin' all of my moves
'Cause the music like crack, got me cookin' all day
I'm right here, you know where I stay
And if you don't, then ask your girl, she probably know the way
She like my show lights, she wanna be wife
She know that if she got me, then she gon' be good for life
So I pull out for the climax faster than a hi-hat, sorry, baby, I don't play
And if I did, you know my kids would be ballin'
And my daughter gon' never meet a nigga like me
My niggas pull up in that Rolls-Royce
Like they sell that coke, boy, shoutout to the Coke Boys
They never pray for us, nobody pray for us, nobody pray, no, no, no, no, no
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh-oh (Oh-oh), don't pray for love (Oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh), say it loud (Just ask the lonely)
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh (Just ask the lonely)

Title: TELEKINESIS
Release Date: July 28, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-telekinesis-lyrics
Song Description: TELEKINESIS was a Kanye West track originally written by Victory Boyd as a gospel song, tentatively titled Future Sounds,  recorded during sessions for Yes Donda. The original title was supposed to be Future Bounce; however, it changed to Future Sounds, then later Ultrasounds.

After being passed around many artists, it eventually ended up being a Travis song. TELEKINESIS would be heavily reworked to feature Future and SZA, where they create a soundscape that is magical, like telekinesis.

Telekinesis is a reference to the supposed ability to move objects via ones mind. It is often fictionally portrayed in superhero films and comics, which Travis has a liking to, even dressing as his favorites on multiple occasions as Batman and Iron Man.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Future]
Used to wanna fuck an R&B bitch, then that shit happened (Yeah, yeah, Pluto)
Used to wanna be rich, then it finally happened
Thought it'd make me happy (Thought it'd make me happy)

[Verse 1: Future]
I could've took the pain and I could've went out sad
Streets stepped in and raised me, but I ain't have my daddy
Niggas tryna clone me, run off with my swag
From sellin' coco, got Chanel on my jacket (Jacket)
Shawty give me mop with the less, it don't last (Last)
Takin' more drugs all alone in a mansion (All alone)
Walkin' around tweakin' with the yop in my hands (Walkin' around tweakin')
Just another broke ho just prеachin' for these bands (Just another ho)
And I know I'm duе for a billion-dollar advance (Uh-huh)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Future]
I can see the future, I can see the future (I can see the future)
I can see the future, it's lookin' like we leveled through the sky
I can't wait to live in glory in eternal lastin' life (Livin' in glory)
Won't you take the wheel? And I recline and I sit still
Might as well turn up now, He gon' pop up unannounced
To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds? (Like the way it sound)

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]

Title: COFFEE BEAN
Release Date: August 3, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-coffee-bean-lyrics
Song Description: COFFEE BEAN revolves around Travis' initially tumultuous relationship with his girlfriend and baby mother Kylie Jenner. He discusses the backlash and controversy that has come as a result of their relationship. The song is one of Travis' most personal yet, detailing many of his inner fears and insecurities; it is arguably his most revealing and vulnerable song to date. Additionally, the soothing boom-bap production is unusual for Travis, who is well-known for his genre-bending contributions to trap music.

It should also be noted that there is a popular coffee chain in Los Angeles (Travis and Kylies home) called The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, which is typically shortened to Coffee Bean.
Lyrics:

Title: 5% TINT
Release Date: August 3, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-5-tint-lyrics
Song Description: 5% TINT refers to a now classic line by Houston legend Slim Thug on his biggest hit Still Tippin':

Five percent tint so you cant see up in my window

Further emphasizing the southern influences of the track, the hook also interpolates the chorus of Goodie Mobs 1995 hit Cell Therapy. It also might be paying homage to an obscure DJ Screw cut Peepin In My Window which featured Lil Keke and Big Pokey.

On the song, Travis waxes lyrically about familiar topics including drugs, sex and cars.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Who's that creeping through my window?
'Fore you come outside, I got the M4

Believed in you, I was your sponsor
I got love for you, but I'm not in love
Gave me affection
Girl, I was lost, she gave me direction
Went through fuckin' you with no protection
All my blessings
Girl, you one of all my blessings
You think I don't care about you?
Girl, you better call my best friend
I got time to waste
Girl, I got time to waste
Girl, I cancelled everything
Just to get back on the same page
To finish the story
But you would rather ignore me
Your mama called to check on me
But you won't even pick up the phone, shit (Yeah!)
Goddamn, you feelin' yourself (Yeah)
Out in Hollywood, you got a nigga with some wealth (Word)
You ain't free tonight, I bet he call somebody else
Tryna tell you I'm the last real nigga left (Damn right)
You can hit me if you need help
With your love problems, with your money problems
I just might solve 'em, I just might solve 'em
I just might solve 'em, I just might solve 'em (Yeah!)

Release Date: August 3, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-who-what-lyrics
Song Description: On ASTROWORLDs 14th track, we see Travis hook up with Quavo and Takeoff of the Migos over thumping production from Cardo and 30 Roc, two producers that had a huge 2018.

Beyond that, Travis and Quavo also released a collab album late last year: Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho. The album also had a Takeoff verse on Eye 2 Eye  the chorus of this song shares a similar flow to several parts of Eye 2 Eye.

Quavo has appeared on both of Travis' studio albums: he was on Oh My Dis Side off of Rodeo, and on Pick Up the Phone from Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight. Quavo and Takeoff also featured on Sloppy Toppy off Travis' Days Before Rodeo mixtape. Scott was also on Migos' last two albums: Kelly Price from Culture and White Sand from Culture II.

In the documentary Look Mom I Can Fly available on Netflix, we see on Travis Scotts notebook that this track was originally titled WHO WHAT WHEN WHY. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TteHD_2iOTk

Title: Apple Pie
Release Date: September 4, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-apple-pie-lyrics
Song Description: On Apple Pie, the final track from Travis Scotts debut album Rodeo, Travis finally decides to jump off his mothers porch into the real world.

As Travis makes it to the mainstream of the ruthless music industry, he realizes life cant always be as sweet as his mothers apple pie, and that he has a legacy to build. The outro voiced by T.I. explaining the motive behind Rodeo is a prayer of sorts, similar to the introduction of the album, Pornography.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Travis Scott]
She say, "Your badass always had a thing for sweets"
Guess that's why I'm so hot on the street
"Won't you and your friends come eat with me?
And let me show you how to whip that recipe"
She say, "Your badass always had a thing for sweets"
Guess that's why I'm so hot on the street
"Oh, won't you come over and eat with me?
And let me show you how to whip-whip-whip-whip that recipe"

[Verse 1]
I don't want your apple pie, mama, yeah
I ain't tryna dap up niggas blockin' me, yeah
Made it out the spot, straight to Quintana
And I'm still that nigga with diamonds on my blocka
I say when they come at me I bet they have some backup
I bet I take your bitch, she take that dick straight up the stasher
Keep an ounce of garlic just to keep away the Draculas
I just seek out to find my home, why can't they just leave me
'lone?

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
'Cause I don't want your apple pie, no-no, mama
I don't want your apple pie, no, yeah
I don't want your apple pie, mama
I don't want your apple pie no more
I need my own pepper-pepper, please, pepper-pepper seeds
Need my own reme—, remedy, my own legacy
Yeah, I don't want your apple pie, mama

[Outro: T.I.]
Huh, que será, será, so the story goes on and on and back and forth, the evolution's absolute
Tours and shows and groupie whores wouldn't hesitate if he had to shoot, though he'd rather not
Forever been the elephant in the room that everyone can't wait to run and tell about
The head to the body of the belligerent militant group that sponsors the revolution that will not be televised
Decide to cross those lil' guys, you've obviously been ill-advised
Yet and still, the question that arises to the mind, "Will he make it? Was it worth it? Did he win? Will he survive the Rodeo?"

Title: TOPIA TWINS
Release Date: July 28, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-topia-twins-lyrics
Song Description: TOPIA TWINS, track eleven on UTOPIA, sees Travis Scott alongside 21 Savage & Rob49 feeding into a false utopia. More specifically when he says:

Twin Bitches hoppin' off a jetski

Travis seems to think that bringing these women to his hotel room will bring them closer to utopia, and that his surface level fantasies can fulfill his own fantasy. However, as exemplified in CIRCUS MAXIMUS, falling into the lifestyle of what is assumed from the public will only bring one to their own dystopia; on the surface it may seem theyve reached peace, but it only brings torture to the soul.

This tracks title TOPIA TWINS contains an interesting omission of the letter U from utopia. It might be a subtle reference to false utopias and dystopias, meaning Travis is aware of his own shortcomings.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Travis Scott & Rob49]
Twin bitches, twin bitches
Twin bitches hoppin' off a jetski (Yeah)
(Ayy, what we doin'?)
Twin bitches, twin bitches (Yeah)
Twin bitches hoppin' off a jetski (Yeah, yeah)

It's so hard to hide I'm a dawg, nigga, I make a mistake and show it
Way I shoot my shot at all these hoes, I fuck my shoulder up
Travis, what if they twins and they Siamese, but they wanna fuck us both? (Yeah)
Buy her what she want and suck her toes, I'm tryna make her cum
Told her throw it back and put that pussy on me (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott & Rob49]
Told her sit it on this dick, I took the glizzy off me
And you know this life been busy, man, I'm Bizzy, homie
And I come through, throw a pack, she never leave me lonely (Yeah, yeah)
I can't do no cuddles, can't stay 'til the mornin' (Can't stay 'til the mornin')
She an angel in the streets, a demon undercover (Yeah)
Lie to shorty like I hate her, fuck her like I love her (Fuck her like I love her)

Title: MODERN JAM
Release Date: July 28, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-modern-jam-lyrics
Song Description: MODERN JAM, UTOPIAs third track, is characterized by engaging synths and lively drums, setting it apart as a standout on the album. It sees Travis Scott team up with emerging Texas artist Teezo Touchdown, whose presence has evoked comparisons to music icons including Andr 3000 and Freddie Mercury.

Travis begins the track with indirect mentions of God, subtly hinting that MODERN JAM refurbishes the original instrumental of Kanye Wests I Am a God. Both tracks are the third of their respective albums, UTOPIA & Yeezus.

UTOPIA draws heavy influence from Yeezus, including this tracks subject matter, which matches Yes On Sight. CIRCUS MAXIMUS also contains a similar drum pattern to Black Skinhead from Yeezus.
Lyrics:

Title: HYAENA
Release Date: July 28, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-hyaena-lyrics
Song Description: HYAENA is the introductory track to the highly-anticipated UTOPIA. In the track, Travis slyly, but quickly cruises over the topics of women, money, and fashion.

Unlike the rest of the album, HYAENA primarily holds a Hip-Hop cadence which allows him to flow on the bouncy 90s-like beat as he samples both Funkadelics  July 1971, Maggot Brain, and Gentle Giants September 1974, Proclamation.

Throughout the track, Travis makes several references to other celebrities such as Kelsey Grammer and Chelsea Handler.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Derek Shulman]
The situation we are in at this time
Neither a good one, nor is it so unblessed
It can change, it can stay the same
I can say, I can make my claim
Hail, hail, hail

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Yeah
Okay, this shit is outta control
I'm drivin' through Hell and I done brought snow
It's shinin' in here, then I done brought glow
I hear the sirens right out the chateau, run me the info
Tryna hear what you did, not how you came close
'Cause I get bobblehead like I done made pro
I made Italian bread like I done made dough
I be all around the map
Write a show 'bout myself like I'm Chelsea Handler
Or write a series 'bout my bitches like I'm Kelsey Grammer
Nicknamed the jet Jayhawk 'cause it's outta Kansas
You know it's Spaldin' in my top, I'm in my esperanza
You know it's slammin' wall to wall

Uh, yeah
C-notes, B-notes, I took the biggest boat
We stayed down for life, it's like a jingle to do 'em all
We too much involved to spend a single ounce of time
She bust a whole ounce by doin' lines
I had to leave, like the leaves do trees
I'm finally home, I wiped the stress, then I touched that sweat
We took 'em 35 to 1 like this shit roulette
Hold up, beg your pardon, we done lit up, baby
Set up, told the preacher, "Never finish," that's to say the least
Buy it, never lease it, but I gotta lease it
Mobile, Mona type of pieces, Met Gala, night Jesus
Skip it, hit the city, party pack, I got it with me
I'm shotty while I let you with me
I'm too bent to let you ride, barely 'til it's empty
Gotta feel me, pockets dumb fat and I got a skinny
Squad is with me, and that's everything I know about it
[Refrain: Travis Scott]
I know about it, I know about it

So how we here trapped on the ocean?
'Bout to go up a level of disrespectful

I'm just one angel away from blockin' out the devil
Just one mountain away from meetin' all my rebels
Too much power, too many hours all in a day
I sent her flowers, ain't talkin roses, I'm talkin' maoda
Ask if she "ha-ha-ha", I wouldn't doubt it
Took her through the Hills at noon, she felt the (And how wonderful, how wonderful)
Baby girl think she in Honolu' (Wonderful)
Don't you know you in the I-5 loop? (How wonderful)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]

Our misery really ain't nothin' to see
I gotta travel the V, I like to travel to heat (Ooh)

Did I tell you I got my own weed? I had a lot to achieve
Blew it out and I'm relieved, take it down, now you relieved
Rather you leave, then you go back out on me
Don't throw no daggers at me, you gotta shoot 'em at least
You know my Dodge supreme, I put in hours this week

We got a timeless thing, we gotta find some Zs, yeah

Wine bottles cost 'bout a couch, you on the way with the wave
Stacks in my pouch, you know it jump at the house
You come with two when it's late, know the brown one is my fav'
Then Mike Brown gon' walk you out (Walk you out)
Step by step, watch yourself
Cleaners got anything you might've left
I couldn't do none of this by myself
With mafia, they in the tuck
I gave you fifty to boost up your butt
I gave you the juice, you'd rather get buzzed
I tried to choose you, you'd rather go club

I shouldn't have pushed so hard
I always push too hard
And now it's just a blackout
And now it's just a blackout

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
My mama always told me, "Put yourself first"
I don't really fall in love with women, man, 'cause love hurt
I hit a couple broads, I can't lie, I put my dick first
Now you runnin' 'round playin' payback and that shit hurt
I should've treated you better (21)
Used to deal with lames 'til she ran into a stepper (On God)
Big dawg Savage, I'm a Zone 6 repper (21)
Niggas throwin' salt, but the Draco came with pepper (Straight up)
She say we ain't goin' nowhere 'cause all I do is sext her (On God)
Woah, never knew that I had to propose, no (21)

I fade away every time that I
Take a sip, I been goin' off the rip
I been bumpin' more Coldplay, the world cold as shit

Knew exactly how to roll one and how to tote a stick
Even if she at the shows, so she never let 'em hit
Always knew she always on one and I can bare with it
Yeah, I can bare with it

Still rollin' up Swishers

In your club, on your couches, got paid to be here
On your girl, rubbin' on my favorite features
How could they tease us? Only wanted Ben Franklins and Mona Lisas

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Man, I might fuck 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out
I'm on a stakeout, on a farm or your lake house

Around 3 AM, dog
I was gettin' busy in the bathroom stall
Bad mamacita, Miami Heat her, put her in a two-seater
Too bad I couldn't three-peat her
Need a whole lotta vida 'fore I see the reaper

Title: HIGHEST IN THE ROOM (REMIX)
Release Date: December 27, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-highest-in-the-room-remix-lyrics
Song Description: Travis Scott enlists the help of Lil Baby for the remix to his October 2019 hit track, HIGHEST IN THE ROOM. Baby was expected to appear on the official single version of the track, however, his verse was scrapped prior to its release.

In late June 2019, Travis performed a large portion of the track, during his Morocco performance and on August 31, 2019, he previewed Lil Babys verse during a live show. On December 24, 2019, a new snippet of the track circulated online, before the entire song leaked. Two days later, ROSALA confirmed her feature on the remix via Twitter.

This track marks the first collaboration between Travis Scott and Lil Baby, although Travis frequently collaborates with Babys mentor, Young Thug, and his Quality Control label mates Migos.
Lyrics:

That ain't what she wanna hear (Nah)
Now I got her in my room (Ah)
Legs wrapped around my beard (Uh)
Got the fastest car, it zoom (Zoom)

When I'm with you, I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (Yeah)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side (Yeah)

Went and bought a new Bentayga
I paid cash, don't see no paper

All my cars' inside tomato
From Atlanta, not Decatur
I'm the one they say don't play with
Make them boys get on your tater
High-five LeBron, floor seat the Lakers
Get more paper, get more haters
Standin' still, my diamonds skatin'
Fucked her once, she think we datin'

Back when I was sellin' two-for-five plays, called in my RAZR
Niggas never had to give it to me, I want it, I'ma take it
Guaranteed to tell a ho goodbye if she don't try to get naked
I'm like mmh
Mmh, gotta get up out my room
Got some more bad vibes comin' through
Mmh, she gon' bust a move ('Toy acicalá')
Like you do

Title: GOD’S COUNTRY
Release Date: July 28, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-gods-country-lyrics
Song Description: GODS COUNTRY, a psychedelic trap-infused track that sees Travis Scott rapping about high affluence to mask the true meaning of togetherness and how he prioritizes his family while staying his need for moving away from the noise.

The track holds a slow and steady cadence as it is laced around a Dez Wright-made sample, looping the words La, la, la, la, which ultimately builds the warped sound while providing a melancholy undertone to it.

The song was originally supposed to be featured on Kanye Wests tenth full-length studio album, Donda, but it was removed for unknown reasons and was eventually released solo.

First previewed from a leaked documentary directed by Dame Dash, Travis officially previewed the track on August 6, 2022  alongside LOST FOREVER  while headlining at the O2 Arena in London.

A week before the albums official release, it was previewed for the final time at iHeartRadio on July 20, 2023, and was described as an exclusive snippet of an additional track from UTOPIA.

On July 29, 2023, Travis released the official music video which portrayed a strong image of a low-income neighborhood, suggesting that the idea behind GODS COUNTRY is that Gods country is a place where there are small and incomparable moments in your hometown  as if theyre Gods wish  which are near impossible to replace.

Title: SIRENS
Release Date: July 28, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-sirens-lyrics
Song Description: SIRENS sees Travis Scott make a nod towards the ancient Greek, human-like creatures with alluring voices named Sirens. In Greek mythology, Sirens were a symbol of the dangerous temptation of lust. Voiced by Drake, Travis' lust that he falls victim to includes that of a woman in his hotel room, along with having festivals inside of his room.

The song was first revealed on July 22, 2023, at Travis' Rolling Loud Miami set, where it was displayed along with 4 other titles in the fictional Utopian language from Thomas Mores 1516 book, Utopia.

The song features upbeat production from Travis' long-time collaborator MIKE DEAN, and Jahaan Sweet, sampling Zambian rock band Amanazs Nsunka Lwendo.
Lyrics:

[Intro: John Fannon & Travis Scott]

And the stars are all there
But when I look for you, you're never there
Explorer, are you out there?
We had to spread out the word
Mmm

I was too damn determined
Rap game, it needed refurbish
I was on top with no service
Watch as they all playin' verses
They in the bushes, they lurkin'
Might gotta call the insurgents
She wanna fuck with a purpose
I gotta juggle my urges
Got a couple departments
Closet built like a department
Double up cup of the bourbon
How I give all of my sermons
Yeah, we still (Still)
Do things down to detail

Only by the grace of God they ain't catch us though

And now he playin' 'round with fifteen or more, ayy

Title: sdp interlude
Release Date: September 2, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-sdp-interlude-lyrics
Song Description: S.D.P. stands for smoke, drink, popreferring to weed, alcohol (maybe in Travis' case, lean), and pills. Despite the title alluding to Scotts liking for substances, he claims he rarely smokes or drinks, and doesnt do any hard drugs at all.

The track samples Washed Outs You and I, and an interpolation of Madonnas Lucky Star.

A demo version of this song exists which is much longer, sporting two verses from Travis, as well as a chorus with different vocal effects and instrumentation. Its unknown why it was changed into this interlude version that made the album.

Title: Piss on Your Grave
Release Date: September 4, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-piss-on-your-grave-lyrics
Song Description: This track was slated to feature Sir Paul McCartney and land on Kanye Wests 7th solo album, The Life of Pablo. Travis Scott had other ideas: he traded an early demo of FML in exchange for this song.

The songs aggressive, in-your-face vibe is reminiscent of Wests Yeezus album in both production and structure.

In context, Piss on your grave is a prophetic announcement to the white executives of corporate America. The baby boomers have retired, and now only Generation X stands between the Snake Persons and corporate governance. Kanye and Travis know these faceless men are a dying breed and cant wait to rain on their parade. Kanye touched on this during his VMA Vanguard Award Acceptance Speech:

We the snake people bro, this is a new, this is a new mentality. We not gonna control our kids with brands. Were not gonna teach low self-esteem and hate to our kids, were gonna teach our kids that they can be something. We gonna teach our kids that they can stand up for themselves. We gonna teach our kids to believe in themselves.

The songs instrumental samples Jimi Hendrixs Machine Gun.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I use your face as a urinal, then do the same at your funeral
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
This one here for the executives, fuck you and all of your relatives
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, nigga, behave
Nigga, behave, nigga, behave

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Us niggas, we can't behave
We mobbed on the pave, got treated like slaves
Young niggas treated like slaves
This the moment I've been waiting for
This why I moved to Cali, stepped outside and got shaded for
Told momma, "Bitch, get back in the door"
I've been comin' up and down, a nigga can't take no more
Kamikaze over commas
Benjamins, dividends stuffed in my jeans, I can't fit in
Poppin' pills since droppin' Ritalins
Pop a penicillin, nigga, you gotta get with it
My, my, my, my, look at little Scotty now
The same fuckers used to doubt
All preachin' that they proud

Title: CIRCUS MAXIMUS
Release Date: July 28, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-circus-maximus-lyrics
Song Description: UTOPIAs twelfth track, CIRCUS MAXIMUS, shares a title with Travis Scotts debut film  directed by himself  both of which were inspired by the attraction in Ancient Rome which was a chariot-racing stadium, and a venue reserved for Italian entertainment. The track was unveiled via UTOPIAs tracklist, shared under two hours before its release.

It unites Swae Lee, The Weeknd, & Travis Scott for a grandiose cut  baring striking resemblance to Kanye Wests Black Skinhead  that plays into the idea of Circus Maximus, more specifically its action and entertainment fed to the crowd, who in modern day are the listeners of UTOPIA.

However, contrary to its stadium status sound, this track addresses how audiences view performers who risk their own health with a lack of humanity, like the Circus Maximuss viewers millennia ago.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Swae Lee]
Unreal, what is this?
God done gave me strength
Are these the front row seats you wanted?
We'll have our final moment

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
A walk-in attraction
A walkin' distraction
I'm naturally Black and
Unnaturally breathin'
Like a waist that is snatchin'
Welcome to my world where it's packed in
At the top of the tavern
How I see when this happenin'
All the real have been dabbed in
All the, all the bumps and the grabbin'
Ain't no cops here harassin'
All the looks and the laughin'
And outside, it got traffic
'Cause inside, we wreak havoc
Yеah, I know when this
Yeah, I know when this drastic, whеre it's goin'
When I back up emotions
All this here, I'm controllin'
When I'm back in the
When I'm back in the streets, on my side, I'm patrollin'
When I'm back in the, when I'm back in the (Ah)

Too hard to go drop off
You know that boy not soft
I never would travel
So I need me a time vault

With my Bailey Osanto
In this world, look around, yo
It's just mano y mano
I might still eat McDonald's
But don't think I'm a Ronald
I went back to my land
Move like Moses, walkin' over seas
In my state because the country
Every part of it is part of me
Tell your parliament, "Pardon me" (Woo)
Off the saké, turned to Socrates (Woo)
Heavy moments on the ground
Feel it shapin' in the sound
'Cause we ri—, 'cause we right in yo' house
And you know that we down
If yo' ass don't know nothin'
Gotta know that it's time
I'm excited to jump in
So much that I'm flyin'
Put you right in the function
Took you right off a vine
Got this shit in a bind
We got it, we got it now (Ah, woo)
Whenever I'm duckin' it (Ah, woo)

I'm waiting on a let go
I know myself, I know exactly how to make you special
Go, collect your fame
I'm waiting in an echo

Title: Green & Purple
Release Date: May 15, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-green-and-purple-lyrics
Song Description: Green & Purple features Playboi Carti, who at the time was fresh off of the release of his self-titled debut mixtape. Travis Scott also brought Carti out at a show in New York on his birthday.

This song describes the effects green and purple have on their system; green being marijuana, and purple being lean. Travis talks about his nights during his 2017 Birds Eye View Tour and references what would be his third studio album, ASTROWORLD, which has been released in 2018 and eventually became one of the best-sellers of that year.

The track was released on SoundCloud.

Title: PARASAIL
Release Date: July 28, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-parasail-lyrics
Song Description: In PARASAIL, Travis Scott employs a reminiscent and psychedelic delivery as he looks back upon his career over a monotone instrumental. The title  derived from the parasailing sport  is likely a call to the cadence of the song, which is much more slower than most tracks on UTOPIA.

Contrasting Scotts reflective lyrics, Yung Lean uses his minimal feature to emphasize how certain people may view artists as plants who have far more backbone in the industry than most newcomers.

This track is laced around a Dave Chappelle speech, in which the predominant message is to never give up, regardless of the situation.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Dave Chappelle]
I stand tall, I fall, I get up
I fall, I get up
I fall, but I get up
I stand tall, I stand tall

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Ridin' parasail, rollin' through the grass
Shaded under trees
Lookin' through a glass
Watchin' by the bushes, waitin' on a breeze
You is all I need
Water movin' fast, washin' memories, tryna make it last
Parasail

[Verse: Travis Scott]
Flyin' through the bush, we flyin' through the bush
Wave, we gon' rock, wave, we gon' take a swole
We gon' swole, we gon' rock clean
We gon' shake off the mother-mother-mother-mother live
We gon' live, we gon' rock show
We gon' pop, we gon' rock, I

And how we took off and how we on top
And how we won't fall, how we goin' up
Or how we came up, or how we came up
It all started in the basement
Was an attic, but we called that shit the basement
Bass used to break all my mama vases
Unc' shot my first 8, then, nigga, I probably weren't eight then

Title: Backyard
Release Date: August 18, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-backyard-lyrics
Song Description: On Backyard, Travis raps about his come-up, new accomplishments, and the great experiences he has had since becoming famous.

This song drew controversy after Logic used an almost identical sample loop in his November 2015 song, Stainless. Both songs sample the same part of Marvin Gayes Distant Lover.

Logic explained the backstory behind the similar samples in a November 2015 interview with Hot 97, confirming that he and Travis had spoken about it prior to its release.

Let me tell the tale of how Jacques turned Scott
Over one lost trip to the sky
Let me tell the tale 'cause you told the tale
When you said I could make it this high
Who knew?
Goddammit, who knew?
The grass ain't greener on the other side, it's just blue
You can really identify when you lookin' in they eyes
Who ready to ride, that's true
When they look in my eyes, they see that real
How Scotty entired that juice, had my back against that wall
Every summer felt so cold, my daddy ain't comin' home 'til fall
That's why my pimp game's so moist, had that du-rag and all
Had a twenty-year-old bitch in high school
Wasn't no tellin' what Travy might do
On the south side of that H-O-U
Hol' up, let's take it back to that room, no car, but still had drive
Just a hundred niggas standin' outside
Life's a beach with lot of sand on the lot
I'ma ride for all of my niggas, they forever here by my side

Title: LOOOVE
Release Date: July 28, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-looove-lyrics
Song Description: LOOOVE sees Travis Scott and Kid Cudi go back and forth about the love they receive from their respective fanbases, and the madness of life derived through fame. However, opposed to tracks like CIRCUS MAXIMUS & PARASAIL, which portray fame and notoriety in a dystopian-fashion, this track highlights the utopian part of it for Travis & Cudi, which is seeing the positivity stemmed from their core fanbases' loyalty.

LOOOVE dates back right to the release of Travis' sophomore 2014 mixtape, Days Before Rodeo. A snippet of an early version of the song surfaced online shortly after the mixtape was released, making it nearly nine years old as of UTOPIAs release.

Come and kick back with us
This a new religion, come and have mass with us
Tell me, have you made love to a bachelor-turned-ambassador?
Used to grow up in the backwoods
Come take a ride with the real, it's the last of us
We gon' make them Vogue bitches turn racheter
First task, 'nihilate, you used to laugh at us
Pass the Actavis 'cause a nigga past passivist
Imagine my world of misogyny
Nigga, fuck a, fuck a monogamy
Got her head tipped over the driver's seat
Meet me, don't go tell my mama 'bout this, baby
Hold up, we gon' own the summer
Never, never stressin', no, we always hit the numbers
Cuzzo always stressin', always cuffin' different numbers
Know he tired of makin' shit, you know the streets don't make diplomas
Drunk somethin', tryna find my keys
I find myself lookin' down at the stars, the bees
The stars align, remember when it was Ramadan
Might try a line, might try some crime, might try to dime
But now it's time
Baby, now it's time, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

I get it, I get it, I get it, love
They love me, they love me, love me long time (Long time, long time)

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
The night is too young and the love in the air, it hit me
Follow all the vibes, I'm in every city
Gamble with your life, thinkin' 'bout it woday
Tell ya homie chill tonight, you don't want it with him
We raise our glasses, the madness
The tiny waist, the asses, dancin' in trances
Baby say she ready and we 'bout to find out
Don't be mad that your girl done found 'bout
And we get it
Never lied, rager-fied, on a mission
And they lookin' like they know, but they didn't
Let me slip into my mode, I slip round the notes
Smokin' plenty with tequila, baby
Members of The Rage runway with it
Fashion week in Paris, front row with it
Diamonds always dancin', no bullshittin'
See a Black god on the job, yeah, I'm so winnin'

Title: Wasted
Release Date: September 4, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Travis-scott-wasted-lyrics
Song Description: Wasted serves as the fourth track off of Travis Scotts highly anticipated debut album, Rodeo. This song features Juicy J and a sample from the Pimp C track, Havin' Thangs 06.

Swedish rapper Yung Lean was originally featured on Wasted; work began on the song in December 2014. King Krule was seemingly also meant to appear on the track at some point, as seen on a picture of an early tracklist. In the end, Travis took both off, likely as Juicy J had access to the Pimp C sample.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Travis Scott]
Wasted or nah? (Aw, aw, yeah, aw)
Are you wasted or nah? Wasted or nah? Wasted at night

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Take a sip, drownin' in this shit, coppers on my hip, I hold my head
I been takin' risks to make that money flip, shots to the head
I ain't order it, I can't afford this shit, go to war with this, you overboard, I'm over-bored with shit
Now, it's pay a player, pay a nigga, got a day-to-day to stack and still, I pay accountants
Twenty racks to show just a little allowance, only come to Houston if the boy allow it
Bow your head to a real one, comin' down with them main niggas
H-Town, don't play with us, them with-it boys stay with-with-with it
I been grindin', slavin' over time since I was a fan
Lookin' in the mirror like "One day, Jacques, you gon' be the man"
One skinny, tatted nigga, blunt flicker, young La Flame, hot spitter who can't hold his liquor, yeah
[Chorus: Pimp C]
It's really goin' down in the goddamn South
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end
It-it-it-it's really goin' down in the goddamn South
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end

[Bridge: Juicy J & Travis Scott]
There's a lot of motherfuckers that can't handle they liquor, can't handle these drugs (Wasted or nah?)
It's only real niggas that can handle their shit, man (Wasted or nah?), yeah (Wasted or nah?)

Is you wasted, baby? One shot, two shots and you still talkin' crazy (Trippy)
Three shots and you faded, freaks comin' out at night and they gettin' X-rated
Four shots now, she wanna do the clique, any more shots, she ain't gon' remember shit
Smokin' on extendos, no clips, project hoes goin' up in the Ritz (Trippy)
She gon' do it for a G, anything for me, bruh, she just wanna fuck and drink and chief all the weed up
Sexy bitch, pop that pussy 'cause you in your prime, pour that purple over ice, call it "turtle time"
Shawty never been a hesitator, got her goin' down on the elevator
Heard the pussy bomb, I'ma detonate her, fuck her from the back, keep the neck for later
No magic trick, but I levitate her, with the magic stick, nothin' less than great
When I hit her with the dope D, I'm gone, don't text me later, no extra favors
[Chorus: Pimp C]
It's really goin' down in the goddamn South
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end
It-it-it-it's really goin' down in the goddamn South
I'm trill, I'm country 'til the end

[Outro: T.I.]
Hmm, weed, lean, MDMA, he say, she say
All the products of a young man gone the long way
From the home that he known, 'til he roamed where he at
And the phone break up, unknown wake up
Several one-night-stands, hung up phone, break up
If he fall, will he fly? Sure, it wouldn't take much
For you to find out, jump, have you took that plunge?
If not in the same spot, how could you judge?
(H-h-how could you judge? C-c-could you judge?)

Title: Hell of a Night

Lyrics:

[Part I]

[Verse 1]
Our first kiss in the livin' room
That's a hella way to end the night
A hella way to end the night
We did drugs in the bedroom
That's a hella way to end the night
A hella way to end the night
But she caught me fuckin' in the bathroom
Rubbers all over the bathroom
That's a hella way to end the night
Tonight, tonight
[Part II]

[Chorus]
I left my girl in the south, but this gold in my mouth
Thought I was in over my head, all my niggas is dead

[Verse 2]
It's a hell of a night for Heaven's sakes
All you see is mountain and clouds, can't hit the brakes
She hit me twice in the face, there go' the base
She like to lift her nylon skirt to show the lace
She say she love me, but don't know what love is
I lost love, 'cause my daddy said it, but ain't ever done shit
Pain is love and love is hell, uh
I might need some bail if this shit don't sell
Hand on my dick while I'm coastin' up the Fiji
Slow motionin' through emotion, tint in case a nigga see me
They'll come and feed you, but that felt a little easy
I brought the squeegee in case it get a little greasy
After a moment I fell into the mist
She reminisce a nigga style, God damn, a nigga rich
Wine and cigarettes under a light
Said she lost that angel done turned into a hell of a night (Night)

I pledge to a flag so grey
No matter what time, the skies are grey

Ooh, around this time, was starving, no Ramadan

Yeah, keep that in mind, fear two things, being broke and dying
Yeah, jump your ass inside, LSD, come take this ride

Might be the last time I trip
I know I said this shit last time, but damn, I never had a trip like this
Who knew a threeway on freeway
Can trip with three hoes to a six-way?
Ain't gotta finesse out the midway
So Bird can wrap birds in that Ben-Gay
No more, goddamn
And pops never gave me shit
But pops ain't raised no bitch
I swung, I missed, he swung, he hit, then I hit that ditch
Raised in a town where they looked so good outside like it ain't that serious
My nigga got dumb years doing dumb shit
Locked up in the car, had to pull a gun quick
Killer tatted on his face, leaked to his conscious
Now he stuck in a cell, know he feeling nauseous
The nigga so good, he was so cold
Another lost kid, Mo City soul

Lyrics:

[Verse]
She take a shot of Hennessy, I take a shot of Pimp C and slow up
I do this shit for him and me, I'm the next Lone Star to blow up
Picture bein' locked in a box, sellin' beats 'cause you need dollars
They say I can make it to the league, Mama, five hundred dollars, all we need, Mama
Then we gon' be on, tired of seeing the lights off
Pops heatin' up the stove, was close to stealin' and killin', now just to get 'em on
Couple drinks down of Rosé, I'm tipsy, y'all faces done look like an emoji
The RAV4 turned into a Rover 'til it took flight and ended up on the shoulder
Now our money a little longer, lookin' back how we finessin', we ain't know shit
They gave me three, got twenty-five on the low, who knew that lump sum would get me on?
My fifteen seconds last a little longer, longer, I can shit all day, diaper
Call that eat-all-day itis, will I ever fall off? I doubt it

[Bridge]
No, no, no, no, all these diamonds shinin'
All this gold on me, all these foes on us
How do I dodge these zombies?
They want my soul from me, know that I'm gone, but one thing
They will never catch me fallin' off, fallin' off
Never catch me fallin' off, fallin' off

Can't even look at my phone line
Without a couple texts that I can't deny
Locked the phone, I had to close my eyes
Half the time, man, they tellin' lies
Who to trust? Man, I can't decide
Nowadays, we just don't reply
But they know my name, they compare it, still

A thousand on the leather, you niggas should know better

Twice only on a Tuesday when I'm in a bad mood
Ooh, your skin mahogany (Fuck, Fuck)
Ooh, let's break the monotony
Government threw us in a maze (What?)
Had me trickin' forty K for some grades (What?)
Just to make forty K for the wage
Dropped out and made that in one day
I'm in a bad mood

[Verse 3]
Ooh, nigga, I'm wildin' on 'em
Mm, back pilin' on 'em (Pilin' on 'em)
I never feel the pain, only God can make it rain (Make it rain)
So I must be Mary, Joseph, Allah

Black slacks, it's R.I.P. clothes, see amigos
Laid back, I cock the nino, game time, gang time
No time to reload, handle mine, take mine
I've gotta deebo, can't waste a minute
Rap Yeats, I master business, but still a menace
Peep my mojo I got together, I'm in my bag
Too many looks, they pocket watchin', gotta hit the gas
Look back, I see the clouds, these niggas doubt
They say a nigga'd never make it, now look at me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hood times, I never cared, I pull up there
Outside your club, I'm at your club

[Intro: Girl, PARTYNEXTDOOR & Travis Scott]
Hey, I'm not allowed to do this, but does anyone have a cigarette?
A menthol cigarette? It's my birthday
I don't smoke cigarettes
I don't either, that's why I look so young
Cigs? It's her birthday
I think Jordan does
Or just, anything
Jordan?
Jordan?

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
I might use the bitch for a cook

I feed bitches rocks and load the Glocks
And now she feinin' like a mothafucka

Last call, last call for the weed and alcohol
Last call for you to slip out them drawers
Girl, I need it right now, get your ass in this stall
We ain't got time to stall
These niggas got me pissed off
Sippin' so long, girl, I'm pissin' Cristal
Sippin' and swervin'
My words don't know if I crashed into a pool or her jaw
Pops never home, left a long term
On the back when a lil' nigga had to sit and deal with it
Loner turned rock star, nigga, under the moon
Got the world in my palm, 'bout to rub her pussy with it
When you dominate it, come with digits
Let her see the Tempur-Pedic
Bend it over, beat it, skeet it
Then delete it, then repeat it
Then repeat it (Yeah) then she told me...
