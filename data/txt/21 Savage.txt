Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

You a stand-up nigga, I love seein' shit like that
[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gon' pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga
[Chorus: 21 Savage]
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)
How many pray that you flop? (A lot)

How many times you got shot? (A lot)
How many niggas you shot? (A lot)
How many times did you ride? (A lot)

How many times did she cry? (A lot)
How many chances she done gave you?

And had an epiphany (21)

Watch so much that a car came with it
Back in the day I used to rob with no mask on
Shit on my wrist, I woulda killed the whole house for
And I went to school high, I ain't go to class though

Caught me with a deuce five, mama kicked my ass, bro

Shawty got a booty, I'ma grab it (I'ma grab it)
In the fast lane, tryna dodge traffic (Skrrt skrrt)

War wounds, I got scars (21)
Teachers told me I wouldn't be nothin' but I went far (21)

While Post experienced this after his rise to fame, 21 sat down with Rob Markman on For the Record and explained that he first began to lose friendships over money when he started getting street money, before his rap career.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Post Malone]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Lost a few friends chasin' hand money (On God)
Had the same friends when I was bummy (Straight up)
They should've went and did stand-up
'Cause when the money come, niggas act funny (True)
Crocodile wristband, 21 Dundee
Yo' bitch skate so fast to the dick
That she'd even go and get a job at Sonic (On God)
Made it from the bottom, I'm a star (21)
Playin' with the stick like a guitar (21)
Why you got a 12 car garage? (Why?)
'Cause I bought six new cars (No lie)
I remember times was dark (I do)
Now I'm backstage with a bar (Big dog)
Couldn't pay the light bill, it was dark (Yeah)
Now I can shine in the dark (On God)
Lost a couple friends, I ain't even really mad though (On God)
I ain't even really mad though (21)
Hard to tell the real from fake
'Cause nowadays, they got masks on
Who gon' be around when the fame and the cash gone?
I lost all my friends countin' bands in a Lambo truck
VVSs on me, fightin' icy like a hockey puck
If she wanna dance, let her dance, watch her pick it up
I don't need no friends, what's a friend if it ain't no trust?

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
I lost all my friends countin' bands and I copped a Benz
Pulled up with no army, just the guap and I'm spendin' it
No, no, never lendin' it, that's all for me
I stay greedy with the dollar, givin' no 'pologies
All these mans with they fuckin' hands out, tryna spare some
I don't never stress, no, I got plenty peso
I been all alone, on my own in my new mansion
Everybody says I went ghost, jump in my Phantom
Paparazzi always tryna press up on me
Ever since I blew up, I don't know nobody (Know nobody)
Yeah, I blew 80 bands only for you to leave
Hey, I know somewhere that my mama prayin' for me (For me)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe (For me)
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth (For me)

If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh

Mama, it's a lot of secrets that I had to keep from you
Got in so much trouble, thought the teachers had beef with you
And it paid off 'cause we livin' like the Greeks and Jews
Used to leave your stove runnin', stove runnin' (21, 21)
Now it's Louis rags when my nose runnin'
Got it out the mud, I don't owe nothin'
You pussy ass niggas, I ain’t on nothin'
Wanna see me fucked up 'cause they poor hustlin'
The same niggas with me back when I was head itchin'
Man I'm having nightmares that the feds listenin'
You fake gangstas pump fakin' and they scared snitchin'
The coupe fast and it's fucking up the dash digits

If you ain't suckin' dick you get a early dismissal
We got your wifey at the spot, she tryna lick a pickle
I just went and bought a Lamb and it cost a nickel
And I came from the bottom and it feel good
And I went platinum, still in the hood
And I take the gang with me everywhere I go
Why these niggas hatin' on me? Man I don't know
Ain't a place in the world that I can't go
And I got a hundred racks inside a Go-Go
And I get a hundred racks for a show, show
Wanna give a bitch my heart but I can't though

You're my old school runner, you're my old school runner
But my new school runnin', it costs more than a hundred
You lil' niggas so bummy (21)
Make a diss song, they gon' wrap you like a mummy
My young niggas geekin' on boot like zombies
They hungry, up it on you then they tell you, "Run it"
I stole cars, drove them like go-karts (facts)
Niggas actin' like bitches, they got both parts (cat)
And I came from the gutter, I don't got no heart
And I'm straight up out the gutter, I don't got no heart
Nigga when they killed my brother, I had to go hard
Put that chopper in his face and then I Bogart
Niggas tryna cross me, I don't understand it
I'm just tryna take care of the family
And I'm sippin' Codeine, not Brandy (21)
And I'm sippin' Codeine, I'm an addict
You go to jail, can't depend on a bad bitch
She fucked and sucked him tryna keep up with the fashion
And I'm really, really rich and I ain't braggin'
Sometimes I really can't believe this shit happened
Who woulda thought I'd make it rappin'?
I almost lost my life when I was trappin'

Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the

Nigga, I was on Glenfair (On my mama, dawg)
Went hollow, Collier Ridge to VC
Robbin', landin', all the way to Line Street, they don't play fair (21, 21)
If you make your bed, you gon' lay there (You gon' lay there)
Made a hunnid on Austin off my cell, yeah (Off my cell, yeah)

Title: Issa
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/21-savage-issa-lyrics
Song Description: Issa is a catchphrase coined by 21 Savage, first used in his interview with DJ VladIssa Knife quickly became slang, and eventually became a meme.

https://twitter.com/21savage/status/826318937151373313

Issa was initially only a Young Thug and 21 Savage collaboration when the snippet was released, however, Drake was recruited for his input.

Issa was rumored to be called Petty or Kylie Jenner (in reference to 21s crush on Kylie) before the official release.

On October 10, 2017, producer Bricks privately uploaded the full song in CDQ on his SoundCloud, but it was only publicly made available in late December. This newer version of the song features Bricks' production tag as well as additional adlibs from Young Thug.

Got a extendo and a hoodie, he gon' shoot you on camera (21)
Lost his faith in Jesus Christ, he prayin' to a bandana
Police gunned his brother down, this shit too hard to handle (Fuck)
Loadin' up his chopper (Loadin'), he gon' show 'em black lives matter (21, 21, 21)

I used to sell dope, nigga, now I can't vote (Vote)
Poppin' Percocets to kill the pain, I can't cope (God)
Anger in my genes, they used to hang us up with ropes (21)

My heart in this 'til I heart attack
Runnin' this shit 'til cardiac
Not far from this shit where they find me at
Flame, Flame, La Flame
Walk in my closet, she tryin' on pieces
She wanna bling blaow for the evenin'
Up at the top it's still plottin' and schemin'
City of Angels, we watch for the demons
Out of the window, we countin' in seasons
Three nights in The Forum for the kids, gotta feed 'em
They open pits up without even speakin'
It's been some tension, but can't rock the wave
Let the coupe roller coast, get the fuck out my way (Yeah, yeah)
It will start makin' sense, I guess, when I get older
For now 'cause they cold, I got ice to get colder
I run through the H, keep an eighth when I go there
Don't break out Moët 'cause I'm lit if I'm sober
Don't mean that I'm slippin' and slidin' on this

Lyrics:

[Intro]
(Zaytoven)
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

[Verse 1]
Rags to riches, nigga came from the bottom
Hood rats, now a nigga fuckin' on models
Ridin' in the foreign, remember ridin' on MARTA
Grind got harder and my mind got smarter
I was gettin' bags for the cheap
When I ain't had money, I was robbin', nigga
I was gettin' bags for the free
21 Gang, they were right beside me
And they still with me, nigga, I'm on TV
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover
Niggas tryna clone a nigga's shit, damn, woah
Used to drive a hotbox, shit, Lambo'
Niggas want a handout, shit, mine broke
I grinded for this shit, I grinded for this shit
Can't change on my gang, niggas still here
Kinda hard to change my ways 'cause the shit real
Niggas rappin' 'bout shit they ain't even lived
Niggas lyin', I can hear it in their ad-libs
I'm poppin' Percocets, bitch, not Advil
It's kinda fucked up what they did to Black, damn
If I catch him in the trap, I'ma whack him
I catch that boy in traffic, nigga, I'ma whack him
Nigga, try to keep up with this fashion, uh
Makin' sure my kids happy, yeah
They dependent on their daddy, yeah
Tryin' not to let the streets distract me
I know it's bumps in the road like acne
Had to sell dope, I couldn't be an athlete
I'm a solid young nigga, you can ask C
The internet ain't gon' help you, understand me
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm a street nigga, yeah, I'm famous
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gang-bangin'
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'
All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
You knockoff gang-bangers ain't bangin'
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'

[Verse 2]
And I come through when the gang need
And I wear shades, so they can't see
And I pay them lawyers and the bond fees
Nigga, one thousand, I'm beyond G
I put my main bitch inside Givenchy
Niggas still askin', "Can you front me?"
My old ho sayin', "Boy, you growed up"
Promethazine, it got a nigga slowed up
Too solid, pussy-niggas can't disclose us
Went and seen Eliantte, and he froze us
I'm too street to walk around with my nose up
Especially to the niggas knew me 'fore I blowed up
Savage Mode drop, now my price'll go up
Streets cold, nigga, they ain't showin' no love
Niggas get in front of judge and they fold up
Face shot, hit that boy with the whole dub
[Chorus]
I'm a street nigga, yeah, I'm famous
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gang-bangin'
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'
All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
You knockoff gang-bangers ain't bangin'
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'

[Outro]
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover15Embed

Title: 7 Min Freestyle
Release Date: July 7, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/21-savage-7-min-freestyle-lyrics
Song Description: Over a menacing instrumental, this freestyle finds 21 discussing licks, hits and sticks with an aggressive yet somewhat satirical delivery. Featuring an abundance of one-liners  21 Savage referring to someone as a shrimp and insulting another by calling him a good dude are common examples of the tongue-in-cheek motives integral to the successful composition of this lengthy banger.

There are some serious moments in the song, however  involving 21s history, materialism, and violence; accompanied by his distaste for those who depend on external parties for their money.

21 has referred to people as being a shrimp multiple times in an earlier freestyle. The term can  by definition be used as a derogatory term toward a person who is small in stature and not their crustacean counterparts.

This song was previewed April 26, 2017, via Twitter.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
October '92 when you pushed me out (Straight up)
It was only right that I made a song about you (Straight up)
Ain’t no tellin' where I'd be if I went without you (On God)
Wish I woulda stayed in school, but I dropped out (On God)
You taught me how to be strong, gotta give praise (21)
When the times got hard, you always made ways (On God)
Even though I barely got the new Js (On God)
You made sure the kid kept a temp fade (Straight up)
And you kept my PlayStation with some new games (Straight up)
And you buy me freezy cups with your loose change (Facts)
My daddy never was around, that nigga too lame (Fuck ’em)
I think that's why I quit school and started to shoot thangs (21)
My mama taught me how to tie my shoes (On God)
My mama taught me how to cook my noodles (Straight up)
Mama told me don't spend all my money with a jeweler
I bought some real estate plus I'm investin' in my shooters (21, 21)

[Chorus]
Had to write a letter to my ma dukes (Ma dukes)
I know you proud of me, but I'm proud, too (I'm proud, too)
You the only woman I'd give some vows to (On God)
I’m still your baby even though I got a child, too (Straight up)
I paid it off, ain’t no mortgage or no rent due (Facts)
Yes, she got a Range Rover and a Benz, too (On God)
It's a hard job, but women raise men, too (21)

I know you proud of me, but I'm proud, too (I'm proud, too)
You the only woman I'd give some vows to (On God)
I'm still your baby even though I got a child, too (Straight up)
I paid it off, ain't no mortgage or no rent due (Facts)

It's a hard job, but women raise men, too (21)
Ma, you never left my side and I thank you (21)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'ma handle business
S600 big body and it's tinted, just to handle business

Walked out of Wells Fargo and ran to Chase
Hopped out a Bentley truck and jumped inside the Wraith
Young Savage, I was trappin' on the back street
All in traffic with that ratchet on the backseat
From the gutter, fake models don't attract me
Got a project bitch, she love to get nasty

Gotta keep it on me, niggas schemin'

Bitch you gettin' comfortable, I don't need you

You know I share everything with my people

Doin' donuts in the foreign while it sprinkles
You keep callin', I'm ignoring, bitch I'm single
You keep callin', bitch I'm single like a pringle
You know I'm fly like G4
Bitch you riding in a Pinto

Title: Thug Life
Release Date: July 7, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/21-savage-thug-life-lyrics
Song Description: Thug Life is an ode to the late hip-hop legend 2Pac. Regarded as one of hip-hops best artists of all time, Pac was a notorious gangster and had a prominent tattoo across his stomach that read Thug Life.



In 1993, Tupac formed a rap group called Thug Life that consisted of Tupac Shakur, Big Syke, Macadoshis, Stretch, The Rated R, and finally Tupacs half brother Mopreme. Eventually, the Thug Life caught up with 2Pac on September 7, 1996 and he was shot four times in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada. Six days later, hip-hop lost one of the greatest artists it has ever witnessed.

In addition to referencing 2Pac, Thug Life, the sixth track on Issa Album, details 21s drug-filled beginnings of him hiding crack at his grandmas house, his experience with an unfaithful girl and other dealings that all represent his thug lifestyle.

The song also samples Giving Him Something He Can Feel, a classic 90s r&b hit by En Vogue.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Scrape the corner, buy a Rover
Crack inside my grandma's sofa
Sunday, family coming over
Move the crack behind the toaster
Carry pistols with no holsters
Trying not to be a poster
You was listening to your coaches
I was listening to the vultures
And I slept with rats and roaches
That's why I don't smoke no roaches
Niggas tryna knock my focus
Wonder why I'm sippin' potion
We happy, dawg, but we ain't joking
Big bullets, we ain't poking
In that pussy, slow motion
Nigga, ain't none of my songs wrote

[Chorus]
I'm thinking to myself, you ain't gang, nigga, fuck you
Feel like 2Pac, Thug Life, nigga, fuck you
If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you
Dog-ass bitch, I knew I never should've trust you

[Verse 2]
Ho, stab a nigga in the back like the streets do
Can't believe that you betrayed me, I used to sleep with you
Niggas quick to say they loyal to you, they be see-through
Gang, gang, screaming, "Fuck you, they want to eat you"
My son got asthma, grandma having spasms
Fuck the chatter, he gon' tattle, put 'em on the platter
Snakes plotting on my downfall, I can hear 'em rattle
(That fuck nigga gon' flop, man, 21 ain't even no real nigga, fuck that nigga)
We sticking to the G code, nigga, we ain't beefin' over freak ho's
I hit her on the D low, yeah, she like my steelo
That nigga think that he a bully, do him like Craig did Deebo
30-round hangin' out the big Glock
Nigga, no six shots, shootin' 'til the clip stops
You a lil' kid and I'm a big dog
Nigga, when we pullin' up the sticks out
Too much money got 'em pissed off
Nigga, I'ma pull up at your bitch house
Fuck a niggas bitch to get a kick out it
Nigga pop percs, gon' get a kick out it
Drinking on syrup with my dick out
Glock 17 with the dick out

What you want, ho, I got what you want, ho

[Verse 3]
All my tint presidential, like I'm Trump, dawg

Denzel, I get surgical with this pump, dawg
Busting down, breaking down, then I put it in a blunt, dawg
Made man stamped, I got "21" stamped
In my face, teetee and taytay in the same count
I was down, bad and now I'm shining like a lamp
You put a ring on her, she ain't nothing but a tramp
They kicked me outta middle school and sent me to the house
We 'bout that gunplay, nigga, motherfuck your count
19, I bought a Cutlass, four 12's and an AMP
Beating down Glenwood, nigga, feeling like a champ
Nigga, we ain't takin' no deals
Lil' nigga, we ain't snitchin', we ain't making no sound
Used to jump niggas, now we jumping in a crowd
Used to make my mama cry, but now I make her proud
I remember rainy days but now she like the sound
[Chorus]
I'm thinking to myself, you ain't gang, nigga, fuck you
Feel like 2Pac, Thug Life, nigga, fuck you
If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you
Dog-ass bitch, I knew I never should've trust you

Ho, stab a nigga in the back like the streets do
Can't believe that you betrayed me, I used to sleep with you

Title: Close My Eyes
Release Date: July 7, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/21-savage-close-my-eyes-lyrics
Song Description: On the third track of his latest album Issa Album, 21 Savage rationalizes his homicidal tendencies and grapples with the consequences of his trapping lifestyle.

Theres a certain game 21 has to play in order to succeed at trapping because to go against that game is suicide. Whats more is that if you arent the one murdering, then you are the one getting murdered. Add to that a traumatic childhood which leaves 21 asking God why all his friends had to die growing up, and youve got yourself a rationale for killing at least 5 enemy gang members and setting an entire block on fire. Not to mention, wasting the police who come to arrest him and his gang.

As a consequence for all of his actions, 21 sees dead bodies whenever he closes his eyes. He has to live with being the one that made the mothers of his victims cry. He also cant get any sleep because hes too high from having to deal with his PTSD.

Yet despite all of his suffering, all of these experiences make him the the last real rapper.

Release Date: February 1, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/21-savage-a-lot-video-version-lyrics
Song Description: The music video version of a lot follows the same structure of the original song with the addition of a new fourth verse from 21.

I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I'm aware
I been playing a bet from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga
[Chorus: 21 Savage]
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)

Before the fame, plan B was robbin' banks (Robbin' banks)
Be a married man, right now I just can't (I just can't)
All the love they gave me, knew that it was fake (It was fake)
Mama love me so much, either way I'm straight (Way I'm straight)
I done seen so many handshakes turn to hate (Turn to hate)
Seen so many BFs turn s-n-a-k (Turn a snakes)
Death before dishonor tatted on my face (On my face)
Way I run the check up, should've been with Chase (Been with Chase)
Start at the bottom, the trenches, the gutters, so I had to go little harder (Straight up)

Lyrics:

[Verse]
Woah, I get rid of all the smoke like Ozium
Shorty got that real jelly, yeah, petroleum
Niggas actin' like my kids and they be older than him
Can't believe they killed Skiney, I really growed up with him
I'ma leave a lot of niggas covered in roses for him
Spray the witness, I ain't leavin' no Jehovah for them
Won a GRAMMY and I couldn't even show it to him
Put my face inside a line up, niggas know that I'm him
Anybody speakin' on my brothers got stepped on
Pull up from the three like Stеphen
And the coupe bald-hеaded like the other Stephon
Put my kids in private school so they could get they prep on
Think my heart made out of Teflon
What? What? Think my heart bulletproof
You ain't got a mask, I can show you what a hoodie do
Pull the string tight 'til your eyelids covered too
I think they on the left, roll the window, hit the lights, boom
Everybody wish they switched sides when we comin' through
Everybody wish they was inside when we comin' through
I pray that you ain't on the other side when we comin' through
PTSD and I mean it
Nigga, Johnny got killed and I seen it
I can't fight with these demons
Top shotta, nigga, I got gunfire for these demons
Hope you know you gotta stand on all that shit you been tweetin'
Took some real niggas from me, I could kill the whole world and I still won't be even
I be thinkin' 'bout my brothers while I'm shoppin' in Neiman's
Real gangster, when I'm gone, carve my name in the cement
Watch these hoes when you rich, they play games with the semen
Trials and tribulations, I face them
Prosecutors probably wanna case him
See my opps, I jump out and chase them
I ain't Charleston White, nigga, I'll never Mace them
Love for all my artists, nigga, I'll never Mase them
Shit, that's probably why they hate him
Tryna get my brother out of jail, I'm like, "Hey, Kim"
Cut from a different cloth, he never let it break him
Look at my advance, it make me wonder, would I make them?
But I own my masters, so I can't do shit but thank them
Video visits, he be smilin' on FaceTime
Passionate, I'm talkin' with my hands, these ain't gang signs
You don't know Larry, Tayman, or CJ, you ain't one of mine
Braids on my neck, nigga, I ain't got no hang time
Nigga, I ain't got no kick-it for you
I don't wanna make friends
I don't wanna make amends
I'm chasin' Ms

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
Once you cross that line, it ain't no tryin' to fix it
You want me to forgive you, let's be realistic
I can't kick it with your kind like I tore my meniscus
How you go from co-defendant to a fuckin' witness?
They'll stand on couches with you, but won't stand on business
Woah
I watched everybody turn on my brother like he ain't have 'em out here flyin' jets and fuckin' bitches
This shit ridiculous
I feel your pain, my brother
I know you from the struggle
I know how hard you hustled just to take care of your mother
I know you took clothes off your back for niggas you call brother
I know how hard it get in this jungle, tryna prevail without bein' tried like you no sucker
Huh, life's a motherfucker, yeah
I know ain't nobody perfect
But what's the point in makin' it out if all they do is cuff ya?

[Interlude]
You know, we be comin' from, like, the worst conditions, the worst circumstances
The trenches, the gutter
And sometimes we be forced to make decisions that we don't even wanna make
It be about survival
At the end of the day, we be havin' good hearts
They just be in bad places
I guess that's life, though
You might also like[Verse 2]
Father God, forgive me for my sins
Take the mask off all my enemies that's out here actin' like my friends
Did some shit I'm prayin' I never gotta do again
I put blood, sweat, and tears inside this win
If I take care of my hood, the prosecutor call me Gotti
Turn my back on the hood, they probably kill me, probably rob me
It's a Catch-22, I'm bein' honest
Hard work, tryna keep the past behind me
I still be havin' flashbacks 'bout Johnny
Fast forward and the major label signed me
Had to hustle, had to focus, perseverance
Mama used to go to TJ Maxx and shop on clearance
Tayman and CJ, I can still feel they spirits
Skinny and Wanwan used to rap, I know they hear it
It ain't that easy, puttin' pain inside of lyrics
Send this up to Heaven so they can clear it

[Outro]
Y'all know, like, real street niggas gon' feel this shit
And I don't want niggas to get misunderstood
'Cause the rules we live by, don't even matter no more
Just a, just a setback for you to come back
Can't hold a nigga down forever
Know what I'm sayin'?
'Til then, we gon' hold this shit down, straight up3Embed

Niggas go to switchin' sides, bitches go to switchin' sides
My lil' brother walkin' on crutches, but he still'll ride
I can't find the words to describe what I feel inside
Go against the gang, you ain't heard? That's like suicide
Pillar box, grab a Glock, spray a block, that's how we slide
Spin that bitch again, nigga, we don't care 'bout who done died
Go to war with everybody if my crew decide
Ain't no fuckin' middle, nigga, better chose a side
No respect for Instagram gangsters, gotta tag something
He was talkin' crazy, caught him lackin' at a gas pump
Start a war, then hide in the house, you get your man slumped
Shots out the Draco, ain't no chaser, got his ass drunk
Every time my voice come on the beat, that shit got mad bump
Nudy smokin' fetus funk, check the score, they ass skunk
Headshot, his forehead lump, flip the switch, nigga, dump

You can feel my presence before I came in the building
I'ma put some condos in my hood, I get a billion
Lost my right hand and my arms and it killed me
Wash away the trauma with the drugs, but I need therapy
My daddy broke my momma heart, while she carried me
I don't respect him enough to even ask him for the clarity
I just want my girl to hold me down and not embarrass me
Treat me how you treat your Birkin bags, baby, cherish me
You heard I don't like you, nigga, now you wanna blast me
If you was a man, you would've had the balls to ask me
I want everybody on, I don't care 'bout who pass me
Knowin' if I turn my back, you probably still gon' stab me
I ain't wanna jump inside the streets, but they grabbed me
Know you want me back, but bitch, you played me when you had me
Gotta make it home, I got some people call me daddy
They depend on me, that's why I bulletproof the Caddy
Take a couple Ms, put 'em in a safe
Then I took my brothers and put 'em all in place
I know niggas envy, I know niggas hate
Shots out the Draco, put 'em in his face
When it come to smoke, I'm givin' what they take
I freed up my calendar, nigga, pick a date
Got a lot to lose, tryin' not to bite the bait

Title: american dream
Release Date: January 12, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/21-savage-american-dream-lyrics
Song Description: The title track and introduction to american dream is a spoken word from 21 Savages mother, Heather Carmillia Joseph. She begins the album by outlining her sons career in  the context of her own life, describing harsh choices and persevering through difficult circumstances so that her familyspecifically, her son, 21could have a better life and achieve his American dream. In hindsight, we know that he became a successful, wealthy rapper and musician. Via Heathers commentary, we can assume the title of this track and the album as a whole are reflective of Savages mindset now that he is this far along on his journey in life. When the introduction ends, it smoothly transitions into all of me, a song that fittingly paints a picture of 21s harsh upbringing and key events across his life.

In an Instagram post made January 9, 2024, 21s mom said:

This Friday 12th.The New @21savage AlbumYall Ready ?!!!!!! Mom is 
#AmericanDream
Lyrics:

[Interlude: Heather Carmillia Joseph]
My dreams have always gone beyond the crossing of a pond
As a mother, every path I walked was for my son
Challenges were a part of the journey
And what I wanted was an afterthought
The idea of providing him proper chances
Helped me to never stop moving forward
Forever confronting whatever transitions that needed to be endured
To make his position as a winner more secured
Now I smile, feeling assured
My choices wеre not in vain
Locations and situations constantly change
But my unwavering hеart remains
For all the trials and all the pain
The mission is as it's always been
For my son to become a man and live free in his American dreamYou might also likeEmbed

Song Description: 21 savage explains that things are quite different where hes from and the mentality his lifestyle is about. His environment is not friendly nor welcoming to the weak-hearted. His experiences have made him the man who he is today.

21 and the Savage family will paint the city red with you.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Hot box with a paper tag on it
Your baby brother used to be my crash dummy
Don't call my phone if it ain't 'bout cash money
I don't wanna talk if it ain't 'bout cash money
I got a lot of shooters 'round me and they hungry
He sold a zip and now he acting like he Tony
I be chasing after money like I'm homeless
I had to leave that bitch alone cause she was bogus
Put a 100 on your head
Now a nigga dead
You niggas know that Young Savage will paint the city red
I don't want to do no song with these niggas 'cause they scared
Draco on the seat I keep that Draco on the seat
Molly, percs and weed you know these bitches like to eat
Slaughter gang, we slaughter hoes cause half these bitches freaks
All the shit I've been through man it change a young G
That's why I keep that hundred round drum around me
That's why I keep a lot of fucking guns around me
If you ain't with the gang you better not come around me
All that motherfucking leechin', ain't no bummin' round' me
You like that pillow talk but niggas shoot for fun around me

[Chorus]

Put a Birkin bag on your wish list
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
My dog don't want nothin' out of life but to kill niggas
And they wonder why I'm still with 'em
All these Ms in the bank, I don't feel richer
I'ma step up in that way since a lil' nigga
Another body get dropped, I don't feel different
Took some Ls, but I'm still winnin'
You knew she was a thot, why you still with her?
When you tell somebody no, you see the real in 'em

[Verse 1]
Slidin' in the Benz
You know that's my brother, so we call each other twin
By the way we shake hands
Got it out the mud, but we grew up in the sand
You a shooter or a fan?
We can't get at you, then we gon' bring it to your mans
I don't do the Twitter rants
Brand new Desert Eagle, tryna stuff it in my pants
Check my net worth, I'll be dead fresh
All my hoes fine, got the best set
If I wanna cuff her, she arrested
Try to take my bitch, you get your neck slit
Call me Santa Claus, 'cause I'm rich-rich

Sippin' on this syrup and it got me movin' slow-mo
She gon' take a charge if we run into the po-po
Walk 'em down 'til I'm tired
Give an opp a first-class ticket to the sky
Diamonds ice skating, if you touch 'em, we gon' slide
Shut up, hit this hookah, you keep fuckin' up the vibe
She ain't mine, but I treat her like I love her
Pussy good, but I can't hit without no rubber
She start trippin', I'ma go and get another

Song Description: Referencing Gully, the film whose soundtrack it was included in, Metro Boomin delivers an energetic instrumental over which 21 Savage regards traitorous individuals with scorn in his verses; articulating the pre-requisites for his romantic involvement on the hook.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Metro!

[Chorus]
I been betrayed before, I done been played before
Givin' 'em all the smoke, givin' 'em all
I done been left in the rain, I ain't have nowhere to go
I feel less of a man, I can't depend on a ho
They put my brother inside the ground, I found me a sound
Don't care if it's war or we fuckin' on bitches, I'm holdin' 'em down
If she a hustler, fine and honest, I'm bringin' her 'round
I told her I don't care what she do in the street
Just don't make me look like a clown

[Verse]
Big dawg status, my play money, whole M stacks in the PayPal
Caught a opp' hangin' at a barbecue and fucked around and shot the whole playground
Eastside nigga 'bout gunplay, say the wrong thing, we'll chase y'all
Hit 'em broad-day with a AR, 12 still tryna get the case off
One twenty-five with the backend, still on tour with a MAC-10
Count a couple Ms, I'm clappin', make sure the fans get a fraction
Don't think I'm just rappin' and all these lyrics cappin'
Talkin' out his neck, we right hook, left hook, stomped and slapped him
VVs in my ear, I look like a star
Plain Jane Richard, I coulda bought a car
If she ain't givin' top, we gon' let her starve
Your shooter wrote a statement, so now we call him Sarge'
Hit him with the AK, make him burn carbs
I brought my Thunder to Los Angeles, Paul George
Make a brick, do the woah with a Ford
Got a thot pregnant, woah, hit abort
Niggas know I'm geeked, high on the moon
21, made man, bada boom
Pussyboy, you're lukewarm, not cool
Glock, Ruger, KelTec, rob who?
Your baby momma went to Cali'
She touchin' the city, we gettin' 'em gone
We really tryna catch a body
You just tryna catch a body in a song
I let down my guard, I showed her my heart
She couldn't believe it was chrome
Them pants thirty-five hunnid

Lyrics:

[Verse]
Life ain't been no walk through the park, where do I start?
Young nigga selling rock and robbin', just not to starve
He never paid attention in school, can't get a job
Plus he confused, most of his partners behind bars, he turned to God
Asking Him why he was dealt these cards, he feeling odd
His blood is cold, his heart's scarred but he's a street nigga
He got a pistol, he gon' eat nigga
He give a fuck about a bitch or a weak nigga and that's real
And if that ain't real then tell me what it is
My cousin, 19, they gave his ass 20 years
My nigga Larry died and I'm still shedding tears
But I salute him cause he kept it real
But there's a lot of fakes
Backstabbing ass hoes and snakes
They turn on their people for a little piece of cake
And when you make it to the top, these fuck niggas hate
But I'm okay cause I know one day
That I'ma leave and they gon' know that I was 100

Lyrics:

[Intro]

(Run that back, Turbo)

[Chorus: Gunna]
911 Porsche, it's emergency (Ooh)
Kick in the door, it's a burglary (Ooh)
Light his ass up, burnin' third-degree (Ooh)
Twenty-five racks for a surgery (Ooh)

When I really pull up, you gon' call the authorities (Ooh)
I run it up, gotta see who I really can trust
'Cause these niggas ain't for me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1: Gunna]
I'm in the ring and my back 'gainst the ropes
I'm a young king and I'm keepin' 'em woke
Jumped off the porch, went and got what I want
Smokin' Biscotti, it smell like a skunk
Take care my mama and brother and nephews
Now what the fuck else is you payin' for?
I sat on the block, but didn't go to school of the hard knocks
And wasn't none of this planned for
I bought her the big body Jaguar
We pull up with sticks like a task force
It's two-twenty MP the dashboard
GunWunna, young Wunna a bad boy
Own business, I got me a company key
Go get it, I get it, ain't workin' for free
You wan' see that show, gotta pay you a fee
She want a big Birkin, the big Bentley B (Big Bentley B)
I'm servin' this cash (Yeah)
Come with it, we kill him, ain't no sympathy
Dig up the grass (Yeah)
Then bury his body, don't nobody speak

Take my gun everywhere, I'm from the A
We call her thottie, you callin' her bae
Every nigga try it, we slid on tape
Nigga playin' tough, got hit with the Drac'
Rich and paranoid, in the hills with a K
Nip it in the bud, I check that (21)
Your bitch in the vert, in my lap where her neck at
Pull up in your hood, we'll stretch that (Straight up)
Your lil' nigga starvin', send him a care pack

I met a new Migo, he said he got kilos

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I met a new Migo, he said he got kilos
He asked me how much can I move, and I told him a few
I'm 21 Savage, I rob all my plugs, and he don't have a clue
He told me, they touch down in a week or two, so be ready to move
A week or two passed, he pulled up with bricks
I'm looking like shit, I'm finna be rich
I took a brick, took a nine out and turned it back into a brick
And it's still coming back, nigga, I got the cleanest dope in the six
I got clean dope down, big Migo, he just changed my life
If he pull up with a hunnid, I might have to take his life
ManMan caught him at the back door, he was looking like
"Papi, why you wanna cross me? I thought you was on my side"
I told you, pussy-nigga, Young Savage with the bullshit
Running off with niggas work, bitch, I'm with the bullshit
I'm a backstabber, but I'm really not with the cool shit
I think the fuck shit that I'm on should be a movement

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Million dollar lick, million dollar lick
Million dollar lick, million dollar lick

With a million dollar lick, you can fuck a bad bitch
Million dollar lick, million dollar lick
Million dollar lick, million dollar lick
I just hit a million dollar lick, and went and ice my wrist

I know you still mad about the brick that I sold ya
I cook me up a brick and went and bought me a Rollsie
I'm playin' with the rock like my real name is Hova
AK-47 still strapped to my shoulder
Them niggas tote choppers like them niggas from Magnolia
I fucked a nigga's bitch

When you gettin' money you can fuck a nigga's bitch
VVS diamonds I done flooded out my wrist
I ain't talkin' 'bout Toronto when I say I'm in the 6

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When you tryna get this money for a brick
Reaching in your pocket feelin' lint

Mess with 21 Savage, they gon' put you on a list

These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't help me grind for this shit
I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's
Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat?
Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes
Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more

[Verse 1]
Shootouts on shootouts on shootouts on shootouts
Young nigga done been on them shootouts
Where yo ass was at dog?
When we was in Wynhollows, nigga, with them tools out
Compton Red's in the cut tryna hit the dope, nigga where the cut in
Tied his partna up in the cut
Me and Lil Harold had took a laptop
That nigga had bussed so the nigga got popped
Me and Johnny tried to rob everything
Mookie tried to tell us, do the right thing
Larry died, man, I cried twice
Chevy went down the road nigga twice
They tried to give my nigga T-Tay life
Tip and Metro nigga ready to fight
I keep Lotto with me, real ripe
Pussy niggas, nigga we don't like
Free Lil Tooto, he gon' open a fight (Pew, pew)
RIP Tayman, that's why I got that knife
I don't get excited about the fame (21)
Bitch I'm still with the same gang (21), bitch I still claim the same thing (21)
Still take a pussy nigga chain

I had to get me some money (Some money), bitch and that drum hold a hunnid
You run up, you know that I'm gunning, 2Pac nigga, thugging (2Pac)
A lot of niggas changed on me, I just bought some chains on me

Lyrics:

[Intro]
(Kid Hazel on the beat)

[Verse 1]
AK, double clip, one in the tip whenever I slide
He exposed his hand talkin' to hoes, we killed two of his guys
I had a load of Reggie, but it was a drought, so niggas gon' buy it
You really feel like I'm pussy? I stay in the street, nigga, come on and try it
Remember them days we were strugglin', hard times, my momma would cry
I got off my ass, I hit me a lick for a hunnid, then wiped her eye
I'm Slaughter Gang, nigga, I slaughter your daughter, you go against me, you gon' die
I'm a God fearin' man but for my brother, I get on that stand and lie
Scrape the pot, wiggle that fork 'til it lock (Wiggle that fork 'til it lock)
Trappin' with no pistol? Get the fuck off of the block (Get the fuck off of the block)
Sleepin' with my MAK-90, I fell in love with the star (I fell in love with the star)
Nigga, I cut my sister off, I catch her talkin' to opps (I catch her talkin' to the opps)
I'll go do a whole elbow 'fore I sit down with the cops ('Fore I sit down with the cops)
My auntie ask for some money but she back to smokin' on rocks (She back to smokin' on rocks)
I don't never have my hand, I don't never raw dawg thots (I don't never raw dawg thots)
They need the coroner, body bag, and a detective when I throw shots

[Chorus]
Big smoke, big smoke
I'm givin' out big smoke, big smoke
Got a whole lot of big smoke, big smoke
Ain't no runnin' from this big smoke, big smoke
Bullets rainin' on 'em

Shoot out all your windows, he moved to California
Ambulance tried to save him, they was disappointed

[Verse 2]
Lamborghini, Perc', chinchilla fur
Ice on brr, drank got me slurred
But this Honda curve, cost a half a bird
Say you from the street, nigga, who you serve?
21 Bandit, strip you out your panties
Glock, it don't jammy, keep a Nick Cannon
I don't pop Xannies, Draco turned to ******
He ridin' dick, fanny, tryna get a candid
Love left me damaged, can't trust my own family
On a home invasion, this nigga froze, panicked
That .44 came in handy, I shot up out the jammy
They took him to the station, I think he finna stand me
I'm known to get some straightenin' 'bout all my smoke, nigga ('Bout all my smoke, nigga)
Clutchin' and Cali Red, smokin' on a Port, nigga (Smokin' on a Port, nigga)
I done sold mid and gas, I probably served your folks, nigga (I probably served your folks, nigga)
I used to sell dry wall when I ain't have dope, nigga (When I ain't have dope, nigga)
Gamblin' in the hallway, posted on Parkway
He was talkin' that rah-rah shit, he got hit broad day
I ain't tryna fist fight none of you niggas, straight to the gunplay
I got engaged to the streets, dawg, the six my fiancé
This Saint Laurent ain't even came out yet, it's still on the runway
I told my opps this shit 4L, they gonna die one day
Better take your ass inside the house, and do what your mom say
You fuckin' with the wrong photographer, you gon' be on the front page
[Chorus]
Big smoke, big smoke
I'm givin' out big smoke, big smoke
Got a whole lot of big smoke, big smoke
Ain't no runnin' from this big smoke, big smoke
Bullets rainin' on 'em

Roll it down and let him have it

Make the white jump like a rabbit
I took your bitch to the cabins
Wipe your nose like I'm Calvin
Paid in full if you ain't know
I ain't chasing no hoe
I ain't worried about a bitch
I keep me extended clips
Young savage, Fresh Jones
I just poured a 4 inside a Jones
I might take your baby mama home
She gon' suck me up and give me dome
Rap niggas I ain't really with it
Shit you rapping about, bitch I really did it
She ain't got no money, I can't hit it
Put some bullet holes in your fitted
She let me nut on her titty
If I say shovel, I dig it
Gangbanging like I'm Suge
Red rag in my Dickies

Fake niggas bend, real niggas don't fold
I'm tricking J's daily, selling sheetrock for blow
In my younger days, nigga, I was robbing stores
Still got it for the low
Judge give you the book, hang your ass without a rope
When you at the bottom, seem like you ain't got hope
And when you got kids, nigga, anything will go
Green dots at funerals, they got my head fucked up
Can't digest these Percocets, they got my chest fucked up

Fast paper had me dropping out of school
Violating laws, breaking all the rules
Smoking marijuana, riding with them tools
Hanging 'round hustlers, robbers, and fools
Hand to hand with strangers, watching from an angle
Praying for an angel, protection from danger
'Cause I done seen plenty niggas died that had a banger
And I done seen them niggas' partner ride out of anger
And never came back, about them greenbacks
Now have you seen that? These are obscene facts
And just because we paid, the stress don't decay
Still thinking 'bout them losses, winning never made 'em fade
With Gs being dead and [?] on my mental
It hurt so bad that I can't do the shit I didn't do
To keep my niggas here with me, I swear that shit be killing me
I hope you niggas feelin' me, 'cause I know that you hearing me
And just because we smile and play
That don't mean that everything is going okay, no
Man, just because we smile and play

Title: Start Dyin
Release Date: May 20, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/21-savage-start-dyin-lyrics
Song Description: 21 Savage and Offset take their Atlanta attitude and aggression to create a classic Trap and straight out the cut vibe. Offsets Gwinett County origins combined with 21s Zone 6 roots create a true Atlanta sound.

Start Dying can be considered the retrofit foreshadowing of Without Warning, which was a full-length album between Offset, 21 Savage, and producer Metro Boomin released on October 31, 2017.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Offset]
(Zaytoven)
Fuck wrong, with a nigga?
Migo Gang
Yeah
Pussy-nigga

[Verse 1: Offset]
Momma told me to get money, but don't be stupid
Know how to add up the grams and weigh up the bands, don't know how to use computers
Bando beating like it's Lex Luger
Pinky ring, sixty thousand, man, you can't fuck with my squad and you know it, man
Come on my block, get extorted, man
Dope on my Margiela, dope on my wrist and my fist 'cause I'm cooking up coca, man
Windmilling that pot like a hurricane
And I hope you don't think that we broke, man
Come to the north and it's Cokeland
The critics, say change my attitude
I told 'em, "Fuck 'em, get my gratitude"
Don't make me show you what the MAC 11 do
Better watch out, you'll get life with that dog food

[Chorus: Offset]
Standing in the trap, made a hundred thousand
Call up Domingo, he pull up extension, he glaowed him
I got them bricks, but used to be nickel and dimeing
Look at my Rollie it's flooding, I can't see the timing
Everything cool 'til you pussy-niggas start dying
Heart of a lion
You pussy-niggas start dying
You pussy-niggas start dying
You pussy-niggas start dying
You pussy-niggas start dying

Pull up on you window down, choppas out, murder gang, nigga, don't slip
21 savage, bitch, I cause havoc
Riding with the .30, nigga, that's a habit
Make the choppa sing like I'm Lenny Kravitz
Bob the Builder, nigga, handy with the ratchets
I'm trappin' and cappin', shippin' and packin'
Robbin' and rackin', designing my fashion
Change on bling, watching my ring
And I beat all my cases so fuck an arraignment

[Chorus: Offset]
Standing in the trap, made a hundred thousand
Call up Domingo, he pull up extension, he glaowed him

Whoa, whoa

[Verse 1]
Etrafta koşuşturup alkol alıyorsun
Fotoğraflar çekiniyorsun çünkü beni özlüyorsun
(Özlediğini biliyorum)
Etrafta koşuşturup alkol alıyorsun
Sikişiyorsun çünkü beni özlüyorsun

Dünyanın yarısıyla yatabilirsin
Bahse girerim yine de beni unutmayacaksın
Aşkı bulabilirsin, evlenebilirsin, çocuk yapabilirsin
Ama sana çakmış en gerçek zenci yine ben olacağım
Sakso çektiriyordum az önce ve aklıma sen geldin
Olabildiğince sağlamım ama sen çizgiyi aştın
Evet, gerçek olmayı bıraktın, işaretleri görebiliyorum
Arkanı kollamaya gelince ben çok gerçeğim
Muhtemelen sana omurgamı verirdim
Sеvgidense sadakati tercih еderim
Çünkü sevgi hiçbir şey ifade etmiyor
Sevgi sadece bir his
Birisini sevebilirsin ve yine de arkasından bıçaklayabilirsin
Sevmek için çok bir şey gerekmiyor
Birisini sadece bağlanarak sevebilirsin
Sadakat bir aksiyondur
Beni sev ya da benden nefret et, hâlâ arkamı kollayabilirsin

Sana her şeyimi verdim
Kankamdın benim
İsteğinle dünya ile savaşa girerdim
Arkamı kolladığını zannetmiştim
Düşmeme izin verdin
Acımı iyileştirdin
Sonra sebebi oldun
Şimdi sensiz devam etmek zorundayım
Şimdi devam etmek zorundayım
Şimdi sensiz devam etmek zorundayım
Şimdi devam etmek zorundayım
Şimdi sensiz devam etmek zorundayım
Şimdi devam etmek zorundayım
Şimdi sensiz devam etmek zorundayım
Şimdi devam etmek zorundayım

[Verse 2]
Bana bir kez yamuk yaptın, siktir git sonsuza kadar
Orta okul kalbimi kırdı, aşk mektupları yazmayı bıraktım
Kalbim soğuk, evet, o kadar soğuk ki Moncler kazak aldım
Sevgililer günü, kartı yırttı ve gül yapraklarına işedi
Kaya gibiydin, ağır metal
Şimdi bi bok değilsin benim için
Aşk olduğunu zannetmiştim sonra uyandım
Ve aydınlanma yaşadım
Ün sende kalsın, aşk sende kalsın
Sadece bana sadakat ver
Nefertiti, Kral Tut
Sana kraliyet ailesi gibi davrandım
[Bridge]
Keşke aşkın solup gitmeseydi
Duman dağılsa bile ben kalırım yanında
Sakın izin verme kimsenin benim yerimi almasına
Asgari ücrete çalışsam yine de kalır mıydın yanımda?

[Chorus]
Sana her şeyimi verdim
Kankamdın benim
İsteğinle dünya ile savaşa girerdim
Arkamı kolladığını zannetmiştim
Düşmeme izin verdin
Acımı iyileştirdin
Sonra sebebi oldun
Şimdi sensiz devam etmek zorundayım
Şimdi devam etmek zorundayım
Şimdi sensiz devam etmek zorundayım
Şimdi devam etmek zorundayım
Şimdi sensiz devam etmek zorundayım
Şimdi devam etmek zorundayım
Şimdi sensiz devam etmek zorundayım
Şimdi devam etmek zorundayımEmbed
