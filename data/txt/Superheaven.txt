Song Description: This song was written about singer Taylor Madisons  younger sister and her heroin addiction, a topic that also inspired the song Gushin' Blood off of their following and final album, Ours Is Chrome.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It's useless, I tried but to no avail
To tell you how much I know, how much I care

[Pre-Chorus]
Come home

[Chorus]
Breathe until your lungs fail
You can sing 'til you go deaf
Everyday that you don't call her
I can feel it coming down

[Verse 2]
I am sick, I am horrified at everything I hear
The youngest daughter lost her way
Everyday repeats itself again
The cycle of our misery, it drives us all insane
Please come home

[Bridge]
The poison takes away from us
Now you're sick to death from all the drugs

[Chorus]
Breathe until your lungs fail
You can sing 'til you go deaf
Everyday that you don't call her
I can feel it coming downYou might also like2Embed

Title: In On It
Release Date: April 30, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Superheaven-in-on-it-lyrics
Song Description: In On It by Superheaven conveys the narrators commitment to helping someone in distress, regardless of the difficulties they face. The lyrics depict chaotic events symbolized by signs and a car crash, yet the narrator remains ready to offer assistance and fulfill their needs.

The chorus expresses the narrators energetic and selfless attitude towards aiding the person, even if it entails sacrificing their own energy and time. The second verse alludes to the narrators struggles with eating and sleeping, suggesting the emotional and mental strain they experience while supporting the individual.

The bridge exposes the narrators vulnerabilities and their feelings of hurt when the person eventually departs. Others fail to comprehend the emotional toll that supporting the person takes on the narrator. In the final verse, the narrator finds solace in nature, particularly in the beauty of fall leaves and fallen trees.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Save your breath, don't you break your neck
I'm seeing signs inside my head
A car crash in the woods
I'm saving things that I think you'll need
On and on until you bleed
Could I be imagining worse things?
Take me for granted and a sin
I'll be in on it, on it, on it

[Chorus]
I'll be in on it
Feeling all this energy
Call me up when you feel sick
I'll be in on it, on it, on it

[Verse 2]
I haven't been eating much this week
Eating's for the strong, sleep's for the weak
Falling in the same routine I see
I'll be in on it, on it, on it

[Chorus]
I'll be in on it
Feeling all this energy
Call me up when you feel sick
I'll be in on it, on it, on it
You might also like[Bridge]
Don't touch me, I feel hurt when you leave
Nobody could understand what this does to me

[Verse 3]
And I know just what I need
Autumn leaves and fallen trees
To feel the cold beneath my feet
I'll be in on it, on it, on it

[Chorus]
I'll be in on it
Feeling all this energy
Call me up when you feel sick
I'll be in on it, on it, on it

[Outro]

Title: I’ve Been Bored
Release Date: May 4, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Superheaven-ive-been-bored-lyrics
Song Description: I wrote this song about bands that do things for the wrong reasons. I see plenty of bands, all over the world, just doing the exact same thing other current bands are doing. Its one thing to be inspired by something another band is doing, but its another to just rip them off completely.  Taylor Madison
Lyrics:

I've been stagnant
I've been bored
Think I've seen it all before
Chewing on a different age
You got carried away

Mirror image for the worse
Another one out of the herd
Take a look around and say that you can tell the difference

Put a gun up to my head
Wouldn't miss me if I left
Negative opinions fall from me

I've been so sick of flowers on everything
Someone told me I'm crazy
Keep it in
Thousands under a dim light
It's hard to see
Guess it's just me
Oh well

Symmetry in everything
But one side is always fake
Take a look around and say that you can tell me different

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]

Buried in the backyard with the dog
I've thought of leaving more times than once
I'm leaving you all alone
I tried so hard to be the rock
But all I felt like was a wet sponge

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna run, I just can't
The things it takes to be a man

[Chorus]
I'm on a road, I'm not proud of the things I have done
Don't let my living bring you down
You'll never know how much it hurts to nod when I'm the son
I'll never stand and watch you drown

[Verse 2]
I'm under a spell, this isn't what I want for us
We've held it all together this long
My spine's deep as well
My heart is bigger than you know
This family is just a sad song

I want you to know how much I care
I wish I could take away your pain
I fear I'll come home to see your grave

[Verse 3]
Mother, please don't cry
I'm states away and begging to die

Its an extremely personal song to me.  Taylor Madison
Lyrics:

Warm steel lays on top of you
Under quiet trees
Cold fear takes a hold of you
Can't feel anything

When your spine went and became two
I'm sorry I wasn't there
All I wanted to see was you
You're sleeping
I said a prayer

Gravel pressing into your skin
You can hardly breathe
But I'm so far away
Tell me anything
Please forgive me

When your spine went and became two
I'm sorry I wasn't there
All I wanted to see was you
You're sleeping
I said a prayer

Had the sweetest dream last night
I was playing with my knives
Gushin' blood ran down my chin
It wasn't mine
It was me against them all
Pinned them up onto the wall
Cut out pieces of their skin
I missed your call

They all tried running away
Chased them down through the woods
You're always running away from me

In my head I'm feeling fine
They all say I lost my mind
They're crying for the ones they love
But they hurt mine
I tell myself it's all for you, but I think I love it too
I took the bodies down the stairs
What did I do?

Blood red stains on my shirt again
This time the house will burn
Sorry, they called your name
When I promised them it would hurt

Gave them more than just a scar

A spade under my arm

This time we'll feed the worms

[Verse 1]
Afraid to be myself
Alone, I can't be loved
I stare through your soul
To find something meaningful
Something that can't grow old

I know where you are and why you're there
It's making it hard to disappear
I see you in the walls where I sleep
Your tight grip, it suffocates me

At least I was loved when I was a kid
I'm feeling the distance
It's so hard to talk when you turn away
In your home I don't feel safe

I know where you are and why you're there
It's making it hard to disappear

Is this not for me?
Are you sick of this?
Every time I leave I come back right where I left

I spent the end of last October crying on your shoulder
I'll just never win
We're going through this, I'm not even there
I'm never there

[Verse 2]
My mind, it could use a little peace and quiet
My soul wouldn't mind a warm place to hide
My ears, red and sore from always standing in the snow
My lungs need air, I spent it on all the thank-yous and goodbyes

[Chorus]
I'm scared, I'm helpless, I'm shaking, I'm weak
My bones, I feel them breaking
I'm tired of losing against me
I'm lost, I can't win

[Verse 3]
My tongue is bleeding red from all the things I can't say
My hands are clawing at the dirt to dig up anything
I can't say I didn't wish for this before
I'm ashamed, I don't deserve to be here anymore

Lay me on the road
Next to the other dead carcasses
Watch the murder, swarm above
Rip me limb to limb
Took everything and left me
Only eyes to see what they've done

You don't know what it feels like
To have it all rest on something important
Pressures pushing in from both sides
I'll break soon

I would try to scream, but I don't have a voice anymore
Been at it for weeks, there's no end
Feeling stretched across the table, I'm next to nothing
All the eyes on me, watch me fail

You don't know what it feels like
To have it all rest on something important
Pressures pushing in from both sides
I'll break soon

Always left broke, no where is home
I see the edge but I pretend that I don't

We recorded all the music and it came time to record the vocals and I still didnt have anything, I was ready to throw it away but Will [Yip, producer] thought it had potential. We were running out of time so I was in the other room writing lyrics while Taylor and Will were laying down ideas in the other room. When I came back after I finished writing lyrics they showed me what they had and it rocked. It became such a strong song.  Jake Clarke
Lyrics:

I've been there before
I never want to go back
I try to forget, what it feels like to be unattached

Always falling apart
Barely hanging on to much
Windows boarded up
Left in the dark
No where to be found, hideaway
Left cold to the touch, don't find me

I wanted it dark
I never let the light in
Covered myself
Hid from everything
Well I was stuck, I never want to repeat
I watch the ground, slowly give out beneath me

Always falling apart
Barely hanging on to much
Windows boarded up
Left in the dark
No where to be found, hideaway
Left cold to the touch, don't find me

Song Description: This song is particularly special to me. Its about my family being evicted from our home last year. We had a really sketchy landlord who didnt do anything he was supposed to do. While we were trying to find a new place to live and resolve the situation, I was getting ready to go on tour in Europe. Ive never felt so helpless in my life. I wanted to cancel the tour, but I knew it wouldnt have made any difference if I was home or away. It was one of the most stressful times of my life. While I was in Europe, all I could think about was my mom and my sisters dealing with the whole thing in my absence. My youngest sister also went back to jail during this time, and shes still there.  Taylor Madison
Lyrics:

I'm in a place I told myself I wouldn't go
A million miles from a house I can't call home

I wanna leave it behind
Stained carpets and all the things we hide
I'm gone for it all, in my mind

God bless the freak show we call "us". I miss home
An ordinary life seems bland, but ours is chrome
I never wanted anything more than a room
Some place to lay my head. A place where I'd have you

I wanna leave it behind
Stained carpets and all the things we hide
I'm gone for it all, in my mind

It's as bad as it seems. I'm losing sleep over the screams
I'm away for it all. God help me

I came down. I turned blue and choked
I came down again

I wanna leave it behind

I won't forget what I said, I meant

I let out, the room went cold
I could tell I ruined things

The words dig in
Let me go and let this end

[Chorus]
Brother, I can't even breathe beneath the sun
Tell me you don't even care

[Verse 2]
Held a glass up to the light so I could see
The colors in the room aren't what they used to be
Tell me all your woes and make it my concern
Drank the water we would use to cool the burn

[Chorus]
Brother, I can't even breathe beneath the sun
Tell me you can't even talk about the things that sent you here
Sister, I can't even try to be someone
Tell me you don't even care

[Outro]

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
We’re all alone
Drifting through the great unknown
Swear I never felt this cold
This is God
It’s in their eyes
Flames have never burned this bright
I got nothing left to fight
It’s long gone

[Chorus]
We open a window to a different place
Climbed through and forgot ourselves
We’re so past the point that we could ever be saved
Angel from a distant hell

[Verse 2]
We’re on a roll
Gettin’ high to keep us low
I just wanna let you know
Somethin’s wrong

[Chorus]
We open a window to a different place
Climbed through and forgot ourselves
We’re so past the point that we could ever be saved
Angel from a distant hellYou might also likeEmbed
