I picked that (Marilyn Manson) as the fakest stage name of all to say that this is what show business is, fake. Marilyn Monroe wasn’t even her real name, Charles Manson isn’t his real name, and now, I’m taking that to be my real name. But what’s real? You can’t find the truth, you just pick the lie you like the best. As long as you know everything’s a lie, you can’t hurt yourself.

—Marylin Manson

Title: The Beautiful People
Release Date: September 22, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-the-beautiful-people-lyrics
Song Description: Marilyn Mansons first original hit after the cover of Sweet Dreams. The song is preceded with a few seconds of backward-guitar feedback and electronic noise. It includes a heavily distorted spoken sample by Tex Watson, declaring We would swoop down on the town and kill everyone that wasnt beautiful.

Lyrically, it is intertwined with 1996s Antichrist Superstar overarching theme, a semi-narrative examination of the Nietzschean bermensch. Within this context, The Beautiful People deals explicitly with the destructive manifestation of the Will to Power, while also exploring Nietzsches view of master-slave morality, particularly the concepts connection with Social Darwinism and its relation to various political and economic systems such as capitalism and fascism.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
We would swoop down on the town
Kill everyone that wasn't beautiful

[Verse 1]
And I don't want you and I don't need you
Don't bother to resist, or I'll beat you
It's not your fault that you're always wrong
The weak ones are there to justify the strong
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
It's all relative to the size of your steeple
You can't see the forest for the trees
And you can't smell your own shit on your knees

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no time to discriminate
Hate every motherfucker that's in your way

[Chorus]
Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
If you live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean
(Ah, ah)

[Verse 2]
The worms will live in every host
It's hard to pick which one they hate the most
The horrible people, the horrible people
It's all anatomic as the size of your steeple
Capitalism has made it this way
Old-fashioned fascism will take it away

Title: SAY10
Release Date: October 6, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-say10-lyrics
Song Description: If anyone just thinks this song is simply anti-Trump and pro-Hillary then you must be new to Manson. This song to me is about cutting off the head of a person and looking at what they are without their vanity and words. And all we are are carnal beasts. This is what Satan truly is; ourselves. The lyrics seem to suggest that Manson shows contempt for the empty shell on the stage (Trump or Hillary if you will) but even more for those in the audience. As they are the ones that will act upon the words, that come from what they perceive as gods and what Manson knows as Satan. Essentially we are all beasts and we shouldnt blindly follow other beasts. This song is very laveyan in that sense.
Its about the desperate acts of people who believe something that is preached by an unbeliever. -Marilyn Manson.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Devil's got a cut like a slit in a cattle's calf
Dollar-sign snakes, I'm all in the damn
God-less, fearless of the flood
Or the blood of the coming Spring
Something is shedding its scales
Crying from the heat of the light
Or the empty shell on the stage
"And cash is the poor man's money"
"And cash is the poor man's money"

[Chorus]
You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
Say, say, "SAY10"

[Verse 2]
Open your mouth, love
Like a gutted church
My goat horns are napalm trees
And a crown of thorns is hard to swallow

You should pray, now
Is it above or is it below?

Title: The Dope Show
Release Date: September 15, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-the-dope-show-lyrics
Song Description: The Dope Show was the lead single off of the 1998 album Mechanical Animals. The song discusses life in the public eye and what it takes to keep your audience entertained in the modern world. It additionally references the influence of drugs in the song title and in the music video as well. The controversial music video depicts Manson as an androgynous alien-like creature that is thrust into the limelight but does not want to be. The Dope Show is Mansons way to warn listeners about the dangers of fame and the ups and downs that come rapidly with an ever-changing audience and industry.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
The drugs, they say, make us feel so hollow
We love in vain, narcissistic and so shallow
The cops and queers, to swim, you have to swallow
Hate today, no love for tomorrow

Title: Cupid Carries a Gun
Release Date: January 7, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-cupid-carries-a-gun-lyrics
Song Description: Written as the opening theme song for TV show Salem, which deals with fictionalised Salem Witch Trials, the lyrical themes of Cupid Carries a Gun deal with similar subject matter.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycGClZhNRjw

The song Cupid Carries a Gun was the last track we just finished for my new album. The occult and witchcraft [are] so often used in cinema with a heinous disregard for even researching its origins. However, I liked the themes of Salem. It looks at the witch trials without being cliche like most modern films
- Marilyn Manson

The song has been played in its entirety live:

Dead and hardened spiders
Like two mangled crowns
On the white heads of the meanest coiled snakes
Folks say that I look like death
Lived in the hotel of my eyes
Blinds wide open like a whore
Paid in spit from that hearse between her thighs

Title: The Nobodies
Release Date: November 11, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-the-nobodies-lyrics
Song Description: The Nobodies is the third and final single released from Holy Wood. The synopsis of the song was inspired by the 1999 Columbine High School Massacre where two seniors opened fire on the school, killing fifteen people (themselves included), and injuring twenty-one others.

The songs title is taken from statements made by Mark David Chapman, John Lennons assassin, who declared that he felt like a nobody.

Manson himself has previously commented on Columbine, as in the dawn of the incident many assumed that he was responsible. Manson later appeared in the 2002 documentary Bowling For Columbine, where he was interviewed by director Michael Moore, famously closing the interview with the quote:

I wouldnt say anything [to the shooters]. I would listen to what they had to say. And thats what nobody did.

Despite the aggressive nature of the song, an acoustic version does exist, and appears in the UK release of Holy Wood and the Bowling For Columbine documentary.
Lyrics:

Title: Deep Six
Release Date: December 16, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-deep-six-lyrics
Song Description: Lyrics inspiration: The close relation between sex and violence, between good news and bad news, helps to explain the compulsion of the admen to dunk all their products in sex by erogenizing every contour of every bottle or cigarette. Having reached this happy state where the good news is fairly popping, the admen say, as it were: Better add a bit of the bad news now to take the hex off all that bonanza stuff. Lets remind them that LOVE, replayed in reverse, is EVOLtransposing into EVIL and VILE. LIVE spells backward into EVIL, while EROS reverses into SORE. And, we should never forget the SIN in SINCERE or the CON in CONFIDENCE. // Lets tighten up the slack sentimentality of this goo with something gutsy and grim. // As Zeus said to Narcissus: // Watch yourself. (Marshall McLuhan).

Deep six is a nautical term meaning to throw something overboard. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to recover something at this depth.

Title: Irresponsible Hate Anthem
Release Date: October 8, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-irresponsible-hate-anthem-lyrics
Song Description: Antichrist Superstars lyrics were a product of Manson only, Except for this song which co-written by band member Ramirez.

In the CD booklet found under the lyrics to the song Irresponsible Hate Anthem, states the song was recorded live on February 14, 1997. This is despite the album being released well before that in October 1996.

Is the opening track on the Antichrist Superstar release. With music composed by Daisy Berkowitz and Madonna Wayne Gacy.

Production was carried out by Trent Reznor and Dave Ogilive, the duo also produced most of the tracks on this release.  Manson and Sean Beavan also produced tracks on this release.

Running time is 4:18.

The song talks about the central contradiction in the christian morals, where love is praised, but in reality hate is what is directed towards different ethnic groups, different faiths, sexual orientations, political values etc. It also references nitzschean anti-christian philosophy of affirmative values and following ones desires, as seen in the line I am the animal who will not be himself.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you
And all the children sing
We hate love, we love hate
"We hate love, we love hate!"
"We hate love, we love hate!"

[Verse 1]
I am so all-American, I'd sell you suicide
I am totalitarian, I've got abortions in my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
I am the animal who will not be himself

[Chorus]
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!

[Verse 2]

Title: Antichrist Superstar
Release Date: October 8, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-antichrist-superstar-lyrics
Song Description: Antichrist Superstar is the  self-titled twelfth track on the Marilyn Mansons second studio album, released in 1996.  The song is composed of 27 rhythm guitar tracks and 5 lead guitar tracks.

The song is most famous for its live performances, which featured an Antichrist podium and a desecration of The Bible, whilst the crowds repeatedly chants Hey.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPQD7KxutcM

Thematically, the song details the rise of Marilyn Manson as the antichrist superstar; his creation was a negative response to his Christian upbringing, which he believed to be hypocritical. The story of this semi-autobiographical character is further chronicled across the trilogy of albums, Antichrist Superstar, Mechanical Animals and Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), which are collectively known as the Triptych.  The story is told in reverse (in a similar way to how satanists read the bible backwards), with Antichrist Superstar, the first album released effectively being the end of the story/character arc.

Title: Coma White
Release Date: September 15, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-coma-white-lyrics
Song Description: This song continues with one of the albums themes: perfection and acceptance (utopia and dystopia). This song is about Coma White, the love interest of Alpha (one of the characters Manson takes on in this album). It tells us that no matter how hard we try to attain perfection, we are always our own worst enemy.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]

She's standing on an overpass
In her miracle mile

A world that threw me away, today, today

Title: WE ARE CHAOS
Release Date: July 29, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-we-are-chaos-lyrics
Song Description: WE ARE CHAOS marks the first single from Mansons 11th studio album of the same name, and his first release since the late 2019 single, The End.

Although having clear references from David Bowies style of singing, the overall tone of the song might have its own meaning, being more uplifting and setting us in a more calm yet sentimental mood, in contrary to Marilyn Mansons usual projects. It also symbolizes the solace and peace of mind his fans might find in his music.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
"Some, you know, we need to find some help for you."

[Verse 1]
If you say that we're ill, give us your pill
Hope we'll just go away
But once you've inhaled death
Everything else is perfume
Maybe I'm just a mystery, I could end up your misery
Maybe I'm just a mystery, I could end up your misery
In the end, we all end up in a garbage dump
But I'll be the one that's holding your hand

[Chorus]
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured
We are sick, fucked up and complicated
We are chaos, we can't be cured

Maybe I'm just a mystery

Title: Third Day of a Seven Day Binge
Release Date: October 26, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-third-day-of-a-seven-day-binge-lyrics
Song Description: Third Day of a Seven-Day Binge was the first single from The Pale Emperor. It is the first single released since 2012s Born Villain. Recorded in one take, Manson described it as:

dirty, like the dirt under my nails, like someone who has dug a grave



It was released as a double A-Side with Deep Six, on December 23rd, 2014.

It was strange, the first review of that song Third Day of a Seven-Day Binge, was equally catchy and depressing. But strangely what I was thinking when I was recording was this will keep a lot of girls in college because if theyre strippers, you know, theyll really like to dance to this song. And its not fair to make beats that confuse strippers becauseits not nicebecause they have a job to do.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
We've only reached the third day of our seven-day binge
And I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
We've only reached the third day of a seven-day binge
I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips

[Verse 2]
I can't decide if you're wearing me out or wearing me well
I just feel like I'm condemned to wear someone else's hell
We've only reached the third day of our seven-day binge
I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips

[Chorus]
I've got bullets in the booth
Rather be your victim than be with you

The most satisfying marriage of styles is Tattooed In Reverse  opening with a punchy, So fuck your Bible and your Babel, its a no-fucks-given glam stomp with the most wickedly tongue-in-cheek pun on the record (Im un-stabled, Im not a show horse), and an electro-gothdancefloor interlude.

Eleanor Goodman, Loudersound.

Title: The Reflecting God
Release Date: October 8, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-the-reflecting-god-lyrics
Song Description: This song is the climax of Marilyn Mansons album Antichrist Superstar, which is a concept rock-opera about the rise and demise of a fictional rockstar. The song is very nihilistic, and is mainly about how life serves no purpose without death, and vice versa. It also talks about how there is no god, and that we are merely cigarettes to be lit and thrown to ashes in the never-ending expanse that is eternity.

ACCEPTED EDIT: The song is indeed nihilistic as it illustrates even in its title Nietzsches philosophy, as in his excerpt about the mad man yelling God is dead meaning each single man believes hes god himself.

You can catch this Nietzsche reference in Mansons godfather, Trent Reznor'sNINs heresy"
God is dead and no one cares
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Your world is an ashtray
We burn and coil like cigarettes
The more you cry, your ashes turn to mud
The nature of the leeches
The virgin's feeling cheated
You've only spent a second of your life

Title: The Fight Song
Release Date: November 11, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-the-fight-song-lyrics
Song Description: The second single released from Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), both The Fight Song title and music video refer to the culture associated with American Football games.

The concepts of the album are heavily featured in the music video for the single, with the two contrasting factions of Holy Wood matching off in a football game; Holy Wood is the home of the Beautiful People, whilst Death Valley is the home of the Nobodies.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GFI6Rf-IkI

According to Manson, the song is about:


a person whos grown up all his life thinking that the grass is greener on the other side, but when he finally [gets there], he realises that its worse than where he came from and that its truly exploitative.

[Holy Wood is] not necessarily [all] about the Columbine incident, but more the reason why it happened  [Its about] the way America raises its kids to feel like theyre unwanted and made to feel like theyre dead already
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Nothing suffocates you more than
The passing of everyday human events
And isolation is the oxygen mask
You make your children breathe in to survive

[Chorus]
But I'm not a slave
To a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit

So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds

Title: Saturnalia
Release Date: October 6, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-saturnalia-lyrics
Song Description: Saturnalia references an ancient Roman festival of the same name, dedicated to the agricultural god Saturn. Saturnalias carnival-like atmosphere overturned Roman social norms, allowing them to participate in darker passions which would not be permitted in everyday life.

Mansons album, initially titled SAY10, was originally going to be released on Valentines Day 2017. However, this was delayed and three new songs were subsequently added, including Saturnalia:

If the record came out when I intended it to, when I thought it was finished back in February, it would not have Revelation #12, Heaven Upside Down or Saturnalia. Those are three of the most key songs that really tell the story [] Those lyrics were all written, but I had not found a home for them. Those three songs take place in the three places where if it were a film, its the opening, its the middle and its the ending.
Lyrics:

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
When all your demons die
Even if just one survives
I will still be here to hold you
No matter how cold you are
No matter how cold you are

I see the terror in your teardrop
Take your belief
Make it snow, let go
And wait together until we thaw

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be another bullet hole
In the exit sign of your road
I don't want to be another bullet hole
In the exit sign of your road

[Chorus]
Just smile like a rifle, hot metal in the setting sun
Just smile like a rifle, hot metal in the setting sun

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I feel I've got to run away
I've got to get away
From the pain you drive in the heart of me
The love we share seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night

[Chorus]
Once, I ran to you, now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I'll give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all

Tainted love

[Verse 2]
Now, I know I've got to run away
I've got to get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
Need someone to hold you tight
And you'll think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way

Title: 1996
Release Date: October 8, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-1996-lyrics
Song Description: This song is about Manson incorporating both the contradictions of society and whats expected of himself, that is, the political correctness coupled with the drug-induced destruction of expression, thought and life that made western civilization become one that is inhuman, even anti-human, anti-life. The values are so twisted, so filled with hate and oppression, ours lives are so blank and artificial, any form of free and natural expression is opposed and stigmatized, so Manson comes as the Antichrist, which the anti-people deserve.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Light a candle for the sinners

Anti choice and anti girl
I am the anti-flag unfurled
Anti white and anti man

Anti sober, anti whore

I can't believe in the things that don't believe in me
Now, it's your turn to see what I hate about me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

Title: Man That You Fear
Release Date: October 8, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-man-that-you-fear-lyrics
Song Description: Man That You Fear was released as the final single from Antichrist Superstar. The albums concept follows the journey of its protagonist, The Worm, as he metaphorically evolves from a worm to angel. Having shed his ability to feel empathy, he repurposes himself as someone feared by society, the eponymous Antichrist Superstar.

As outlined in his autobiography, Marilyn Manson initially wrote Man That You Fear during his cousins wedding ceremony. The song appears to detail how Mansons past experiences and upbringing have informed who he has evolved to becomea man or monster that people have grown to fear.

The music video depicts a man who is condemned to die, and chronicles his last day on earth before he is stoned to death in the desert. According to Manson in a 1999 MTV interview, the video was inspired by Shirley Jacksons 1948 short story, The Lottery.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Ants are in the sugar, muscles atrophied
We're on the other side, the screen is us, and we're TV
Spread me open, sticking to my pointy ribs
Are all your infants in abortion cribs
I was born into this, everything turns to shit
The boy that you loved is the man that you fear

[Chorus]
Pray until your number
Asleep from all your pain
Your apple has been rotting
Tomorrow's turned up dead

[Verse 2]
I have it all and I have no choice but to
I'll make everyone pay and you will see
You can kill yourself now, because you're dead in my mind
The boy that you loved is the monster you fear

[Chorus]
Peel off all those eyes
And crawl into the dark

I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape

Pinch the head off, collapse me like a weed
Someone had to go this far

Release Date: May 5, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-saint-lyrics
Song Description: The 7th song on Marilyns 5th studio album The Golden Age of Grotesque. The song was recorded in two California locations between 2002 and 2003: at Mansons own Doppelherz Studio in Hollywood and at The Mix Room in Burbank.

A music video for the song was released. However, it became notorious for its extremely graphic nature.

This music video was banned by its parent label, Interscope Records, in the United States. In Japan and Germany some of the more graphic scenes were blurred.  Manson himself described the video as:

An uncompromised look at me at my absolute lowest point, the point where I have to look up to see shit, that Im below that,
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]

Song Description: Angel with the Scabbed Wings is the tenth track on the 1996 release Antichrist Superstar.

The song features a riff strikingly similar to the main theme of the Broadway Jesus Christ Superstar, of which Antichrist Superstar is a parody.
Lyrics:

He is the angel with the scabbed wings
Hard-drug face, wanna powder his nose
He will deflower the freshest crop
Dry up all the wombs with his rock and roll sores

Dead is what he is, he does what he please
The things that he has
You'll never want to see
What you're never gonna be, now
Sketch a little keyhole for looking-glass people
You don't wanna see him, you only wanna be him
Mommy's got a scarecrow, gotta let the corn grow
Man can't always reap what he sow

[Chorus]
He is the maker
He is the taker
He is the savior
He is the raper

Title: If I Was Your Vampire
Release Date: April 16, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-if-i-was-your-vampire-lyrics
Song Description: 6am christmas morning  6 am reference to when humbert and lolita first had sex in the hotel room,   he calls it christmas morning (because he wrote the song on Christmas)  but also because its like he woke up to find a gift for him  except the gift is actually the girl in his bed.   no shadows no reflections here -> vampires dont have shadows or reflections, so he is calling himself a vampire.  Humbert is similar to a vampire because vampires feed on its victims blood for its own needs. while Humbert feeds on Lolitas innocence for his sexual needs.   So soft and so tragic as a slaughterhouse  refers to Humbert/the vampire describing the event that is occurring at 6 am.  you press the knife against you heart,  say that "i love you so much you must kill me now   Some predators are so completely desiring of their victim that they start to believe that the victim wants them back,  in Lolita, some might say that lolita never seduced humbert first and it was all in his imagination because he wanted her so badly,  if this is a vampire, he feeling like he wants her blood so badly she could beg him to drink her blood and it wouldnt make a difference to him.  in his sick twisted fantasy he sees her saying I love you so much you must kill me now, whether kill me means rape me, drink me, eat me is up to how you look at it.  another example is in eminems stay wide awake https://genius.com/11210145   in lolita humberts actions actually did SPOILER lead to her death so on that first 6 am morning he effectively started her down the road to her death, but this song is most likely about a vampire tho.    well have eachother until the sun  this refers to how humbert drugged lolita in attempt to put her into a deep sleep so he could get naughty with her while she was sleeping, this however didnt work but when she woke up at 6 am, thats when they got it on.  but orginialy his plan was for them to have each other until the sun  because when the sun comes up lolita will wake up from her deep sleep.    Digging your smile apart with my spade tounge  a metaphore for their relationship where only he is happy while she is being abused.  very cleaver word choices.  the hole is where the heart is  the hole has a double meaning,  the hole in his heart is what he wants her to fill,  also the hole could meen the hole in the ground for the tomb,  where he wants to be with her, which would also symbolically fill his hole, or tripple meaning the hole could refer to her pussy hole which he loves like its her heart.    "we built this tomb together i wont fill it alone  he claims that theyre relationship was equal and both parties were equally sinfull in their actions,  so he wants the consequences to effect both of them and let them both die together similar to how humbert and lolita both died the same year but in different places meaning they had something of a connection but the connection they had was not meant for this world but maybe another.  Beyong the pale everythings black no turning back  means that beyond the vampires pale skin he is pure evil and theres nothing that can make him realize what hes doing is wrong and he shouldnt do it.   blood stained sheets in the shape of your heart  could refer to the vampire spilling her blood or humbert making lolita bleed by taking her virginity on the hotel bed.  this is where it starts means this is where their relationship starts and this is also the first step to both of their ends.  (they both die)    here comes the moon again  refers to how vampires come out at night.   drive me off the mountain youll burn and ill eat your ashes  - they both die,  her because he abused her and him because  while he was to busy abusing her she drove him off the mountain symbolically getting rid of him death waits for no one  he;s saying we all die so might as well do all the things you want to do even if it will lead to an earlier death since in the course of eternity a 1 second life is no different from a 2 second life.    i think our time has come  he thinks the time has come for him to use her also he thinks it is their time to die from consequences as well,
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
6AM, Christmas morning
No shadows, no reflections here
Lying cheek to cheek, in your cold embrace
So soft and so tragic, as a slaughterhouse
You press the knife against your heart
And say that, "I love you so much, you must kill me now"
"I love you so much, you must kill me, now"

[Chorus]
If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time
We'll have each other until the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face
Because I think our time has come

[Verse 2]
Digging your smile apart with my spade tongue
And the hole is where the heart is
We built this tomb together, I won't fill it alone
Beyond the pale
Everything's black, no turning back

[Chorus]
If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time
We'll have each other until the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one

Song Description: This is a single possibly off the new Marilyn Manson Album which has been teased at not to long ago. This is the first single since the abuse allegations and the record label sign. This is the first song released by Manson on nuclear blasts records.
The part and the title could possibly be a reference to the line in wrapped in plastic which says Im only as sick as the stick in the pig

Manson would also post this on twitter
As Sick As The Secrets Within is a personal look into my life & Im proud to be able to share my art and vision with you.

The music video as directed by Bill Yukich. It features shots of Manson and a person with a cloth over their body. In some shots you can see Marilyn Mansons paintings and Manson has dressed up in different things which may be a reference to the beautiful people. SO MANY REFERENCES IN ONE SONG!
Lyrics:

This is no longer just my communion
The worms of the flesh have turned
With all the sacrifices I swallow
And the blood from the cup is so cold

You're only as sick as the secrets within

I built this cage we've been trapped in together
Can't remember where I hid the keys

Title: Rock Is Dead
Release Date: September 15, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-rock-is-dead-lyrics
Song Description: In the third single from Marilyn Mansons third full-length studio album, Manson discusses the emptiness of contemporary rock music.

This sentiment echoes Billy Corgans statement when interviewed by Howard Stern in 1998 (Corgan was involved with Mechnical Animals in an early advisory capacity).

Im on Howard Stern; I say rock is dead. Angry phone calls I dont care. Rock & roll is not about what you play, its about how you play it. Its the spirit, OK?

The song also examines the general numbness of Western society, caused by illicit drugs abuse, the influences of religions, as well as violence as a form of entertainment.
Lyrics:

We were neurophobic and perfect
The day that we lost our souls

Title: Lunchbox
Release Date: July 19, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-lunchbox-lyrics
Song Description: I wrote a song called Lunchbox, and some journalists have interpreted it as a song about guns. Ironically, the song is about being picked on and fighting back with my Kiss lunch box, which I used as a weapon on the playground. In 1979, metal lunch boxes were banned because they were considered dangerous weapons in the hands of delinquents.

 Marilyn Manson for Rolling Stone

Despite Mansons statements, the lyrics have often been interpreted as criticizing gun control in America.

Title: Cake And Sodomy
Release Date: July 19, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-cake-and-sodomy-lyrics
Song Description: Manson has stated that he wrote this song while stuck in a cheap hotel and flipping channels. One had someone baking a cake and another had a hardcore anal sex scene. The juxtaposition seemed to encapsulate some core concept of American white trash culture.

The song questions the puritanical mindset that sex is solely for procreation. Rather, it is the solvent of isolationism. The experience through which a solitary human being, caged in the prison of himself comes closest to escaping from the lonely bondage of life by uniting himself with another. This song may have some purpose in desensitising the hardened idea of random rough sex upon societys normal outlook of it being considered taboo.

In addition to the 1994 album Portrait of an American Family, versions of the song also appear on early Marilyn Manson cassette tapes, Grist-o-Line (1990), Lunchbox (1991), Live as Hell (1992) and Refrigerator (1993), as well as the unreleased album The Manson Family Album. Remixes of the song (titled White Trash, and Everlasting Cocksucker) are also featured on the 1995 remix album Smells Like Children.

Title: Cryptorchid
Release Date: October 8, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-cryptorchid-lyrics
Song Description: Cryptorchid is the sixth track on Marilyn Mansons 1996 second LP Antichrist Superstar.

Though Cryptorchid has a video, it was not released as a single, nor a promotional single. Though, it was put on the single version of The Beautiful People as a B-side.

Cryptorchid has an interesting video, but was not made intentionally for the song. The video are clips from the 1991 experimental horror film Begotten. Fans call it something you find in the Deep Web.

People often confused the title for Cryptorchild, with a L between the I and D. But it has been confirmed to be just Cryptorchid, with no L.

The title for Cryptorchid was dirived from the word Chriptorchidism, a medical condition in which a boy going through puberty has only dropped one testicle; hence the line I wish I had my balls
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Each time I make my mother cry
An angel dies and falls from heaven (But when they get to you)
When the boy is still a worm
It's hard to learn the number seven
But when they get to you (5, 6, 7, 8, never)
It's the first thing that they do (7, 8, 9, 10, Heaven)
But when they get to you (4, 3, 2, 1, never get to 7)

[Verse 2]
Each time I look outside, my mother dies
I feel my back is changing shape (But when they get to you)
When the worm consumes the boy
It's never, ever considered rape
But when they get to you (I wish I had my balls)
First thing that they do (I wish I had my balls)
But when they get to you...

Eden Eye serves as the outro for performances of Coma White during several tours.

The fact that this is track 15 most likely has some significance as 15 is a recurring number throughout the bands work.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
"A loved one laid his head in her lap
Red roses fell to the floor
And the world stood still"

[Verse 1]
My mouth was a crib and it was growing lies
I didn't know what love was on that day
Heart's a tiny blood clot, I picked at it
It never heals, it never goes away

[Pre-Chorus]
Burned all the good things in the Eden eye
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die
Burned all the good things in the Eden eye
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die

[Chorus]
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world, you took the angel away
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay

Title: Slave Only Dreams to Be King
Release Date: January 15, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-slave-only-dreams-to-be-king-lyrics
Song Description: Well known as a literary prism through which much great written work has been filtered into his vivid, lurid spectrum, Marilyn Manson incorporates one very obvious influence on this album, most notably with Slave Only Dreams to Be King  namely, Oscar Wilde.

Slave reads very much like one of Mansons intense dreams had while falling asleep with a volume on his chest; in this case, the volume lay open to Star Child by Oscar Wilde.  The imagery and activity in the story translate well to Mansons typically lurid imagination:


The beatings taken by the slave (once a king in his own mind, destined to be crowned again, but beaten by one whom he would consider worthless were he not condemned to the same destitution);
Wildes cloak of golden tissue curiously wrought with stars transmorphed by Manson into Fibonaccis golden spiral, the bees (trapped in honey) scattered across the fabric at the golden ratios intersections are Wildes stars sewn across the fabric;






The beggar woman and the leper who become his brand new parents at the end of the fable;
At the place of the old and evil-visaged man (who uses a spelled ring of graved jasper to magically unlock his door), the pomegranate tree that covered the entrance to the Star Childs dungeon, trapping him as the apple trapped all mankind.



Mansons dreamlike spin casts this fable in a modern, clearly cynical light: How would most of us react today if we had been the Star Child  humbled as was the boy-king, or bitterly awaiting our chance to reign?  If the story had been written by Manson with himself as each character (at least as wonderfully appalling as Aphex Twins Come to Daddy video), this song would be the distillation.

Mansons immersion in Wilde does not stop here, but is merely put front and center in Slave  throughout Pale Emperor he references Wildes works, most notably The Picture of Dorian Gray in Odds of Even (My dagger and swagger are useless in the face of the mirror/When the mirror is made of my face); Dorian Gray is also woven into Deep Six via the reference to Narcissus who, of course, is the basis of Wildes Star Child.

Noting these references to Wildes Dorian Gray and Star Child, lets go back to Slave Only Dreams to Be King for an Ouroboros twist only Manson could conceive: Persephones fanatical distraction by the Narcissus flower is what led to her capture by Hades (Verse 2), and her subsequent consumption of the Pomegranate seeds that damned her to return to the underworld, instigating (Demeters) winter.

The name of the volume in which Oscar Wilde published his Star Child story?

A House of Pomegranates.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
The human will, that force unseen
The offspring of a deathless soul
Can hew away to any goal
Though walls of granite intervene
Be not impatient in delay
But wait as one who understands
When spirit rises and commands
The Gods are ready to obey

[Verse 1]
Take my money like an ugly bee
Covered in my honey, too dumb to see
My Fibonacci blinded by your jealousy
I'm happy to pull my veins out and braid a rope
I don't need hope to know that you'd die slow
I'm happy to pull my veins out and braid a rope
I don't need hope to know that you'd die slow

Title: EAT ME, DRINK ME
Release Date: June 5, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-eat-me-drink-me-lyrics
Song Description: EAT ME, DRINK ME, is the 11th and final song of the album Eat me, Drink me, ending the vampire-inspired gothic theme of the album. The lyrics are quite abstract, but a few references can be seen through out the song. The title references Jesus Christ who said to eat his body and drink his blood. The Alice in Wonderland inspiration present in the album can be seen here in the Red Queen whose trees are painted blood red, and is fond of beheadings, which is also a reference to the work of russian-american novelist Vladimir Nabokov, Invitation to a Beheading. Another of his works is referenced in the phrase This is only a game, this is only a game, which appears in his book Lolita.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
In the wasteland, on the way to the Red Queen
It's no wonder our stage clothes have dreams to be famous
The trees in the courtyard are painted in blood
So I've heard she hangs the headless upside down to drain

[Refrain]
Eat me, drink me
This is only a game
This is only a game

[Pre-Chorus]
I was invited to a beheading, today
I thought I was a butterfly next to your flame
A rush of panic and the lock has been raped
This is only a game, this is only a game

[Chorus]
But then our star rushes in
Feeling like a child and looking like a woman
She's been forecast with an attempt to kill herself
But the ending didn't test well

Title: Great Big White World
Release Date: September 15, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-great-big-white-world-lyrics
Song Description: This song is written in the point of view of an Astronaut looking down on our Earth and what he sees is a world only white. A world that we have destroyed.

Before the release of Mechanical Animals rumors spread that the title of this track was a racial statement. Manson cleared up the rumors by stating that this song is about cocaine.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
In space, the stars are no nearer
Just glitters like a morgue
And I dreamed I was a spaceman
Burned like a moth in a flame
And our world was so fucking gone

[Pre-Refrain]
I'm not attached to your world
Nothing heals, nothing grows
I'm not attached to your world
Nothing heals, nothing grows

[Refrain]
'Cause it's a great big white world
And we are drained of our colors
We used to love ourselves
We used to love one another

[Chorus]
All my stitches itch, my prescription's low
I wish you were queen, just for today
In a world so white, what else could I say?

[Verse 2]
And hell was so cold
All the vases are so broken
And the roses tear our hands all open
Mother Mary, miscarry
But we pray just like insects
And the world is so ugly now

Title: The Speed of Pain
Release Date: September 15, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-the-speed-of-pain-lyrics
Song Description: This song is about how desperation can be a hard thing for us to be in peace with ourselves and society, so by saying outrace the speed of pain Manson must mean he just wants to run away and feel like nothing in this world matters

PROPOSED SUGGESTION: This song is about drugs and their effect and can also be figuratively applied to love lost
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Marilyn Manson]
They slit our throats like we were flowers
And our milk has been devoured

[Pre-Chorus: Marilyn Manson]
When you want it, it goes away too fast
Times you hate it always seem to last
Just remember, when you think you're free
The crack inside your fucking heart is me

[Chorus: Billy Corgan]
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day
And I, I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day

[Verse 2: Marilyn Manson]
I wish I could sleep, but I can't lay on my back
'Cause there's a knife for every day that I've known you

Title: The Golden Age of Grotesque
Release Date: May 5, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-the-golden-age-of-grotesque-lyrics
Song Description: The Golden Age of Grotesque is the sixth song off the album of the same name.

Marilyn Manson said in an interview with Outburn that he had a burning piano in mind when writing this song. Manson also notes in the same interview that the entire song was written, performed and recorded in about 12 hours.

I just wanted to lay out my sack of notebooks  there were about 20 of them  and I had been writing down phrases that come from wherever I can find them. I spread them out and I started singing. It has such and odd phrasing and cadence, like after the chorus, I hit this high note on the word Gloominati. I was creating words that didnt exist, but it seemed like the way I could paint this picture. Sometimes you have to mix colours.

-Marilyn Manson

Title: Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)
Release Date: April 17, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-heart-shaped-glasses-when-the-heart-guides-the-hand-lyrics
Song Description: Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand) is the first single off Marilyn Mansons sixth studio album Eat Me, Drink Me.

When Manson was interviewed, he said, The song was written because I had been reading the book Lolita and it was very close with Evan Rachel Wood, whos now my girlfriend, and she came to visit me one day wearing these glasses like Stanley Kubrick in Lolita. And part of it because of her sense of humour and knowing that people would make their comments about our relationship because shes younger than me. And when I saw her wearing those glasses I had to write a song about it, and thats the way I wrote most of the record.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
She reminds me of the one in school
When I was cutting, she was dressed in white
And I couldn't take my eyes off her
But that's not what I took off that night
And she'll never cover up
What we did with a dress, no
She said, "Kiss me, it'll heal but it won't forget"
"Kiss me, it'll heal but it won't forget"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't mind you keeping me
On pins and needles
If I could stick to you
And you could stick me too

[Chorus]
Don't break, don't break my heart
And I won't break your heart-shaped glasses
Little girl, little girl, you should close your eyes
That blue is getting me high
Don't break, don't break my heart
And I won't break your heart-shaped glasses
Little girl, little girl, you should close your eyes
That blue is getting me high, making me low

That cut up the negatives of my life
I couldn't take my hands off her
She wouldn't let me be anywhere but inside

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't mind you keeping me
On pins and needles
If I could stick to you
And you could stick me too

[Chorus]
Just don't break, don't break my heart
And I won't break your heart-shaped glasses
Little girl, little girl, you should close your eyes
That blue is getting me high
Don't break, don't break my heart
And I won't break your heart-shaped glasses

Title: Heaven Upside Down
Release Date: October 6, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-heaven-upside-down-lyrics
Song Description: Title-track Heaven Upside Down was revealed on September 6, 2017 via Loudwire.

If the record came out when I intended it to, when I thought it was finished back in February, it would not have Revelation #12, Heaven Upside Down or Saturnalia. Those are three of the most key songs that really tell the story, Manson explains. Those lyrics were all written, but I had not found a home for them. Those three songs take place in the three places where if it were a film, its the opening, its the middle and its the ending. Then theres the song after Heaven Upside Down, its sort of the end title credits where its really surmising the story of the record, which is to be interpreted by the listener.

Title: BROKEN NEEDLE
Release Date: September 11, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-broken-needle-lyrics
Song Description: This is a play on Snow White tale by Brothers Grimm.

Verses tell a story of princess eating an apple and falling asleep for a century what can be recognized as plot of Snow White where the girl was tricked to eat a poisoned apple and, as people thought, die. But she was saved by her friends, dwarves, who occassionally dropped her coffin and made the piece of apple jump out of her throat, thus resurrecting her.

Manson replaces the evil stepmother in this plot with himself, a narrator, telling princess the truth from the very beginning. Thus, though she is awared, the story will go on as its supposed to, so Manson, despite being a broken needle in the record player, still makes the record play from alpha to omega. He questions the expediency of doing this (All of these lies are not worth fighting for) but does it like a machine.

Later in the outro, he compares his struggles to the result of his actions and finally denies to go on what can be heard in line Ill never ever play you again. This decision comes not only by his suffering, but also because the tales played by record player are lies and he cant see the point in setting them over and over again.

This song closes the album with bitter taste of disappointment, which on the other side can be defined as finally seeing the truth and acting the right way. Manson is done with tales, the needle is finally broken and record player is doomed to stay silent forevermore.

Leaving the record player metaphor, it might be a story of Mansons relationship with some person or even with entire humanity itself. He kept doing what he was supposed to for a long time but then saw it was bringing zero result, thats why he decided to leave and finally breathe free. He either leaves the person alone in their fictional silly world or stops listening to what society says, and now its not simple flaming protest for protest but a weighted decision of an adult man getting old. Now that he has seen almost everything, he can be sure there are no fairy tales, and no record player can save us from reality. He throws the delusions away and leaves to heal his wounds, to not be broken ever again.

Title: Target Audience (Narcissus Narcosis)
Release Date: November 11, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-target-audience-narcissus-narcosis-lyrics
Song Description: Throughout Target Audience (Narcissus Narcosis), Marilyn Manson appears to confront religious fundamentalists and the media. He critiques their abuse of power and influence, and mocks the medias obsession with ratings. This theme even extends to the song title, which alludes to chapter four of Marshall McLuhans 1964 book Understanding Media, titled The Gadget Lover:Narcissus as Narcosis.

Near the end of the song, a snippet from WABC Radio broadcaster Don Gardiner confirming the assassination of President John F Kennedy  The President is dead. Let us pray is played. This transitions into President Dead on the album, the title taken from a headline about the incident.

On an appearance of MTVs Total Request Live, Manson stated that this was his favorite song from the album Holy Wood.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Am I sorry your sky went black?
Put your knives in babies' backs
Am I sorry you killed the Kennedy's and Huxley, too?
But I'm sorry Shakespeare was your scapegoat
And your apple's sticking into my throat
Sorry your Sunday smiles are rusty nails
And your crucifixion commercials failed

But I'm just a pitiful anonymous (Yeah!)

Title: Rock ‘N’ Roll Nigger
Release Date: October 24, 1995, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-rock-n-roll-nigger-lyrics
Song Description: For obvious reasons, Rock n Roll Nigger is a controversial song to cover, which not many artists tried to do.
Its a cover of the original Patti Smith song.
Manson chose to cover this song, despite the use of the N-word. He explained:

I thought Rock N Roll Nigger was a song that I could really relate to, and our fans could relate to, about being an outsider. I also thought that nobody else really, in our era of music, had the courage to do a cover of a song like that because, you know, they would get in trouble for the title but this song isnt about racism. Its about standing up for yourself

Title: Little Horn
Release Date: October 8, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-little-horn-lyrics
Song Description: Little Horn is the fifth track on the 1996 release Antichrist Superstar. The song is based on a dream Marilyn Manson had of an apocalyptic future in Fort Lauderdale where most of the human race had been turned into zombies for the entertainment of a small elite. There was a strip club where they had reanimated female corpses and made them dance naked in cages made of thick metal bars. Their flesh was covered in boils and gnarled veins, and their hair was falling out in clumps. Their jaws had been wired shut so that they wouldnt bite off the penises of the men around them masturbating. The dream was the beginning of the concept for the Antichrist Superstar album.

Title: Lamb Of God
Release Date: November 11, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-lamb-of-god-lyrics
Song Description: Lamb of God is an song on Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), in which Marilyn Manson comments on the way in which the media makes martyrs out of public figures who are killed.  It is part of the cult of personality that Holy Wood as an album investigates.

Holy Wood, which isnt even that great of a hyperbole of America, is a place where an obituary is just another headline. Where if you die and enough people are watching, then youre famous
- Marilyn Manson

Its interesting to note that the song takes several elements from other songs, mostly by Mansons favorite artists. Nothings going to change, for example is a variation of a Beatles lyric from the song Across the Universe, while the song is sung in the tune of Radioheads Climbing Up The Walls. It re-enforces a concept Manson often discussed when this record came out: We are the TV. Were a copy staring at a copy, of a copy of a copy Eventually its a xerox thats so degenerated we dont know what came first.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
There was Christ in the metal shell
There was blood on the pavement
The camera will make you God
That's how Jack became sainted

[Pre-Chorus]
If you die when there's no one watching
And your ratings drop, and you're forgotten
If they kill you on the TV
You're a martyr and a Lamb of God

[Interlude]

There was Lennon in the happy gun
There were words on the pavement
We were looking for the Lamb of God
We were looking for Mark David

Burn his money and his house down
And wait for the fire to spread

Sometimes hate is not enough
To turn this all to ashes
Together as one and against all others
Break all of their wings and make sure it crashes

Title: SOLVE COAGULA
Release Date: September 11, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-solve-coagula-lyrics
Song Description: Solve Coagula comes from the Latin words Dissolve and Coagulate, the two words describing a process to break a substance down to its basic elements before reforming it into something new, which is to say that nothing new can be built if not before we make space, breaking the old.

Its written on the forearms of Baphomet and is tattooed on the side of Marilyn Mansons hands, as on the the 1856 drawing popularized by French occultist Eliphas Levi, as described by BBC News,

He envisaged a winged hermaphrodite with a torch between his horns and a pentagram on his forehead.  Its arms bore the Latin words SOLVE (separate) and COAGULA (join together)  the powers of binding and loosing usurped from God.  Levis drawing was the inspiration for the Satanic Temples new monument.

That Detroit monument was unveiled in 2015; Time magazines quote from a key organizer adds a socio-political meaning to the de-facto controversy created,

Baphomet contains binary elements symbolizing a reconciliation of opposites, emblematic of the willingness to embrace, and even celebrate differences, Jex Blackmore, who organized the unveiling, told TIME late Sunday night. In a sense, the statue is a stress test of American plurality: at what point does religious freedom make the people uncomfortable?

Levis Baphomet, 1856:
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You are the one
Tore off both your arms
Gouged out your eyes
And ripped out your own tongue

Title: Fundamentally Loathsome
Release Date: September 15, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-fundamentally-loathsome-lyrics
Song Description: The song deals with the drug-induced escape from reality, and the opposition of the numbed empty life to an awaken life, which faces suffering and tries to deal with it, instead of denying it. It also speaks once again in the album about love and hate, opposing the numbness caused by love to the extreme vivacity of hatred.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
And I wanna wake up in your white, white sun
And I wanna wake up in your world with no pain
But I'll just suffer in a hope to die someday
While you are numb all of the way

[Chorus]
When I hate it, I know I can feel
But when you love, you know it's not real, no
When I hate it, I know I can feel
But when you love, you know it's not real

[Verse 2]
And I'm resigned to this wicked fucking world
On its way to hell
Living are dead and I hope to join them, too
I know what to do and I do it well

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
The sky was blonde like her
It was a day to take the child out back and shoot it
I could have buried all my dead
Up in her cemetery head
She had dirty word witchcraft
I was in the deep end of her skin
Then it seemed like a one car wreck
But I knew it was a horrid tragedy

[Pre-Chorus]
Ways to make the tiny satisfaction disappear

[Chorus]
Blow out the candles on all my Frankensteins
At least my death wish will come true
You taste like Valentine's and we cry, you're like a birthday
I should have picked the photograph
It lasted longer than you

[Verse 2]
Putting holes in happiness
We'll paint the future black if it needs a color
My death sentence is now a story
Who will be digging when you finally let me die?
The romance of our assassination
If you're Bonnie, I'll be your Clyde
But the grass is greener here
And I can see all of your snakes

Title: Godeatgod
Release Date: November 11, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-godeatgod-lyrics
Song Description: GodEatGod is the opening track to Holy Wood (In The Shadow of the Valley of Death).

The title GodEatGod is a spoonerism of the term dog eat dog.

Manson said himself that this album can be interpreted many ways. In terms of the albums concept, in reference to American celebrity culture, or in reference to Mansons own life. In reference to the Celebritarian movement I think this is Manson talking about how Kennedy was made by the media into a Christ like figure after his death. So the God Manson is referencing in the verses isnt the God of the Bible, but the God Kennedy was made into after his death.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Dear God, do you wanna tear your knuckles down
And hold yourself?
Dear God, can you climb off that tree?
Meat in the shape of a 'T'
Dear God, the paper says
You were the King in the black limousine
Dear John and all the King's men
Can't put your head together again

[Chorus]
Before the bullets, before the flies
Before authorities take out my eyes
The only smiling are you dolls that I made
But you are plastic, so are your brains

[Verse 2]
Dear God, your sky is as blue
As a gunshot wound
Dear God, if you were alive
You know we'd kill you

Before the bullets, before the flies
Before authorities take out my eyes

Pointless intervention, legal separation

Title: Organ Grinder
Release Date: July 19, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-organ-grinder-lyrics
Song Description: Organ Grinder is a response from Manson regarding criticism against him. Throughout the 90s, Manson and his band were the target of multiple religious and parental groups who verbally attacked him over his/their image and lyrical content. Manson is essentially parodying himself with the lyrics; which  samples the eerie character called the Child Catcher from the 1968 British musical fantasy film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

On top of this, the title plays into the opening and closing seconds of the song, where an automatic mechanical pneumatic organ can be faintly heard. A person playing this instrument is referred to as an Organ Grinder. The title could also have a sinister connotation to it; referring to someone who literally grinds entrails, or organs.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I am the face of piss and shit and sugar
I do a crooked little dance with my funny little monkey
What I want, what I want is just your children
I hate what I have become to escape what I hated being!

[Verse 2]
Calliopenis envy from your daddy
You're not gonna hear what he don't want to hear
What I say disgusts him
He wants to be me and that scares him

Title: Posthuman
Release Date: September 15, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-posthuman-lyrics
Song Description: The word Posthuman or Post-human is a word that originates from futurology that means a person or entity that exists in a state beyond what we know as a human.

While the exact meaning of the word Posthuman varies, it is generally considered to be a person who through either genetic manipulation or other biointerventionist measures, has the ability to remain healthy and active through an extended period of time that would not be considered normal by our current standards.  Their cognitive powers, such as deductive thought or other intellectual capabilities, would far surpass those of a simple human.

Posthuman was released on the bands website before Mechanical Animals released, making it the first song from the album to be heard by the public.

Title: Track 99
Release Date: October 8, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-track-99-lyrics
Song Description: Track 99 (also known as Better Messiah, Dying Years, Minister, Empty Sounds of Hate and Untitled despite there already being a song by this name) is the ninety-ninth track on the 1996 release Antichrist Superstar.
It is separated from the final song on the album, Man That You Fear, by eighty-two silent tracks about four seconds long in duration. When the album is placed on loop, the pacing to Irresponsible Hate Anthem matches that of the additional distorted recitation found in Track 99, causing the album to display a perfect loop.
Lyrics:

[Outro]
— Go ahead and build a better messiah, we can dig another grave
— This is your calling. If you are hearing this, there's nothing I can do. Something has grown in my chest, and I have seen it, it is hard and cold. It's been dormant for many years. I have tried to save you, but I cannot come to save you. But this is what you deserve, this is what we deserve. This is something that we have brought upon ourselves. We are not a victim, you are not a victim. We are not a victim, you are not a victim. God will grovel before me, God will crawl at my feet. These are the dying years, these are the dying years.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Do we get what we deserve?
Or do we deserve what we get?
Steal from the last, fuck the past
Here is your present, let's take the future
Do we get what we deserve?
Or do we deserve what we get?
Steal from the last, fuck the past
Here is your present, let's take the future

Don't try changing someone else
You'll just end up changing yourself
I keep my head together
Better keep your head together

You hand me a shovel and expect me to dig my own grave

Title: ♠ (Spade)
Release Date: May 5, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-spade-lyrics
Song Description: Track 10 from the album The Golden Age of Grotesque also known as .

Certainly one of the most Grotesque elements of The Golden Age is that which the song Spade is about; Lustmord or Sex Murder. Giving a woman power over a mans heart also gives her the power to destroy it. And with that destruction is the natural human instinct to reclaim what had been usurped, which is what Sex Murder answers towards.

The painting pictures with words imagery Manson uses often comes into play with Spade, as a Spade itself resembles an upside down heart which has been stabbed. Just as in the song his sweet knife rusts tomorrow, covered in the color red and corroding with the stains of blood from the body of the lover who scorned him. And we said til we die, being realized, although not in the manner it is traditionally said in, whilst the screams of the retribution sex murder victim can be heard after this line, personified by Manson, as well as the exhaustive aftermath of the murder, the climax of the song.

In recording The Golden Age Of Grotesque, much of the time spent was dedicated towards developing powerful beat driven rhythms. The beat of Spade that can be heard is the lethargic beating of a dying heart.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
The beauty spot was borrowed
Now my sweet knife rusts tomorrow
I'm a confession that is waiting to be heard
Burn your empty rain down on me
Whisper your deathbeat so softly
We bend our knees at the altar of my ego

[Chorus]
You drained my heart and made a spade
But there's still traces of me in your veins
You drained my heart and made a spade
But there's still traces of me in your veins

[Verse 2]
All my lilies' mouths are open
Like they're begging for dope and hoping
Their bitter petal chant "We can
Kick, you won't be back"
I'm a diamond that is tired
Of all the faces I've acquired
We must secure the shadow ere
The substance fades

[Chorus]
You drained my heart and made a spade
But there's still traces of me in your veins

But there's still traces of me in your veins

We're on a bullet and we're headed straight into God

Title: No Reflection
Release Date: March 13, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-no-reflection-lyrics
Song Description: No Reflection was the lead single off Marilyn Mansons eighth studio album, Born Villain, and in many ways represented a return to form by Manson.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Crushing, cheating, changing
Am I deaf or dead? Is this constricting construction
Or just streets with rusty signs
Of something violent coming?

[Pre-Chorus]
This will hurt you worse than me
I'm weak seven days a week
Don't run from me
I won't bother counting one, two, three

[Chorus]
I don't know which me that I love
I've got no reflection
I don't know which me that I love
I've got no reflection

[Verse 2]
I can show myself how to make a noose
A gun's cliché and a razor too
I'm not a death-trip vacation vacant station
Made of scars and filled with my old wounds

[Pre-Chorus]
This will hurt you worse than me
I'm weak seven days a week
Don't run from me
I won't bother counting one, two, three

Title: Cruci-Fiction In Space
Release Date: November 11, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-cruci-fiction-in-space-lyrics
Song Description: Cruci-fiction In Space is another song on Holy Wood that alludes to John F Kennedy status as a matryr, whilst also subversively questioning a key tenet of Christianity  the crucifixion of Jesus.

The song also continues the albums theme of celebrity death, a concept that Manson calls Celebritarianism.

FUN FACT: The song was written and recorded in Drop C#/Drop Db guitar tuning (and is the only Marilyn Manson song in this tune).
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gun
If Christ was in Texas
The hammer, the sickle, the only son
This is your creation
The atom of Eden was a bomb
If Jack was a Baptist
We'd drink wine from his head

[Chorus]
This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man and the gun

[Verse 2]
I am a revolution
Pull my knuckles down, if I could
I am a revelation
And I'm nailed to the Holy Wood

[Chorus]
This is evolution
The monkey, the man, then the gun
This is evolution
The monkey, the man and the gun

In our space, in our space
