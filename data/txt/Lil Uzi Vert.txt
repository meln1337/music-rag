Artist: Lil Uzi Vert, Alternate Names: Orenji, Renji, Symere “Lil Uzi Vert” Woods, Symere Woods, Lil Uzi, Steaktown Vertical, Symere Steaktown, Steaktown Zombiez Vertical, Lil Vert, Sealab Vertical, Sasuke
Artist Description: Symere Bysil Woods (born July 31, 1995), professionally known as Lil Uzi Vert, is an American recording artist from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In an interview with Vibe Magazine, the Francisville, North Philadelphia native explained the origins of their stage name:

Some guy was just like ‘You rap fast, man. Like a little machine gun,’ and from that moment I was Lil Uzi.

Uzi also added “Vert” to the end of their stage name. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Uzi described the meaning of “Vert” as “straight to the top, like a vertical leap.“ Lil Uzi Vert is also a loose homophone for Lucifer — a name that fits perfectly with their satanic image.

After being inspired by their classmate William Aston’s freestyles, Uzi began making music for money in their sophomore year of high school in 2010 — under the moniker Sealab Vertical. Following this, the two formed the rap group Steaktown with a fellow Philadelphia rapper A.Y. — ultimately causing Uzi’s first official song “Steaktown Anthem” to come into fruition.

Shortly preceding the release of Uzi’s first project Purple Thoughtz Vol. 1, they caught the attention of the A$AP Mob along with their label’s co-owner Don Cannon. The latter led to Uzi signing to Generation Now their second project, The Real Uzi came out.

After scoring songs with notable names like Metro Boomin, A$AP Ferg, and Lil Durk, Uzi dropped their critically acclaimed Luv Is Rage mixtape late that year — leading to them being throned “breakout artist of 2015” by HotNewHipHop.

Uzi’s January 2016 performance with the A$AP Mob would preface their stardom, as they would go on to drop “Money Longer” in the following month — the two-time platinum single that would put them into the mainstream’s radar. They then dropped their first commercial mixtape Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World, which likewise marked their first charting Billboard entry. Furthering their long list of achievements, they appeared in the most renowned XXL cypher of all time alongside being in their 2016 Freshman class.

Uzi’s feature on Migos' “Bad and Boujee” and the release of their hit single “XO TOUR Llif3” gave Uzi significant popularity and exposure, peaking at #1 and #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 respectively.

Lil Uzi Vert’s style has been compared to Lil Wayne on multiple occasions, and their style has been described as emo rap with some elements of rock. They have also been called a lo-fi rapper. Uzi calls Marilyn Manson one of their biggest inspirations.

Uzi released their highly anticipated debut studio album, Luv Is Rage 2 on August 25, 2017, a sequel to their first mixtape. The album debuted at #1 and is certified double platinum.

On January 11, 2019, Uzi allegedly quit music and claimed they would be deleting all of their music on an Instagram story, later turning out to be false:

I wanna take the time out to say I think each and every one of my [supporters] but I’m done with music I deleted everything I wanna be normal. I wanna wake up in 2013

On March 25, 2019, Complex confirmed that Lil Uzi Vert was being managed by Roc Nation, even amidst long-term conflicts with Uzi’s label, Generation Now, and they returned to music with the single “Free Uzi” three days later.

On March 6, 2020, after over a two-year delay and releasing a majority of singles in 2019, the rapper dropped their highly anticipated second studio album, Eternal Atake. It features their highest charting Billboard Hot 100 single, “Futsal Shuffle 2020” and “That Way” with a classic pinch of Backstreet Boys' 1999 smash hit, “I Want It That Way”.

Only a week later on March 13, 2020, Uzi released the deluxe version of Eternal Atake titled “Eternal Atake (Deluxe) – LUV vs. The World 2” which also serves as the sequel to their 2016 mixtape Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World. It features many highly anticipated songs such as “Lotus,” “Bean (Kobe),” and more. Other artists, such as 21 Savage and Young Thug also make appearances.

On July 22, 2022, Uzi released the EP RED & WHITE as a precursor to their then-upcoming third studio album, Pink Tape—red mixed with white creates pink. The songs were released one by one through Uzi’s SoundCloud between July 16 and July 22, before the project was made available on streaming services. The EP featured fan favorite snippets, including “I KNOW,” “FOR FUN,” and “BELIEVE ME,” among others.

On June 30, 2023, Uzi released their long-awaited third studio album, Pink Tape. The album features twenty-six tracks, including Uzi’s October 2022 hit single “Just Wanna Rock” and two of their most beloved leaks from 2018: “Of Course” and “Zoom.” The album contains guest appearances from Travis Scott, Nicki Minaj, Bring Me The Horizon, Don Toliver, and BABYMETAL.

Title: Myron
Release Date: March 13, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-myron-lyrics
Song Description: Myron starts off Lil Uzi Verts LUV Vs. The World 2, the deluxe edition of his second studio album, Eternal Atake.

Originally referred to as Like Me by producer Supah Mario before its release, the track was first previewed on Uzis Instagram on September 22, 2018. On November 28, Uzi previewed an extended snippet of the song in an Instagram live video.  Finally, on March 6, 2020, Uzi confirmed the tracks title to be Myron, along with implying its inclusion on the deluxe edition of Eternal Atake. The next day, Uzi teased two new  snippets from Myron, building up the hype for the track even further.

A large portion of the second verse differs from what was heard in previews of the song. This new verse is believed to have been re-recorded and switched out the week Eternal Atake dropped.

Get Dior discounts from my cougar
Back in the sixth grade, I got them bad grades
I was in love with my tutor (Yeah)

The songs instrumental is the work of Philadelphia-based producers Oogie Mane and Brandon Finessin, both of whom are members of the Working on Dying collective. It is built around a sample of Mykko Montanas 2012 track Do It, which would cause a delay in the songs release due to clearance complications.

Sanguine Paradise was originally previewed on December 8, 2018, when Uzi used it as the opening track for his Lil Uzi Vert + Friends concert held in Philadelphia, PA, at the Wells Fargo Center.

The song was leaked online on March 31, 2019, under the fan-made title Money Keep Coming, a day prior to the leak of Thats a Rack. The leaking of both songs prompted Uzi to respond in a photo posted to his Instagram story, in which he wrote:

Everytime something leak you know everything takes longer .so have fun
Lyrics:

[Intro]
We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my ho
She shake her ass (I'm working on dying), do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro

[Verse 1]
If she left with me, she the right ho
Man, she ridin' me like a BMX
Man, she said the D is for Dyno
I got two horns like a rhino
It's no way you could buy ho
But I bought a mansion with a slide door
Yes, I opened up the slide door
So you can hear her hit the high note

[Bridge]
I like the way you (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)

Money keep comin' in, I can't lose
Money keep comin' in, I can't lose

Foreign car got V10, I can't cruise

I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin' and my doors suicide

[Verse 2]
Side note, you will never reach my goals (At all)
I be walkin' with a slime nose
And I'm also walkin' with my side ho
Only time I be walkin' when I'm on the moon, so I feel like Michael
I was talkin' to my little slime, that's a lil' lizard, call her Geico
In reality, I'm 5'4"
Stand on my money, now I'm 6'6"
Hit her once, now she dismissed
Can't fuck her sister, make her lick dick
Forty-orty make my hip thick
When I see an opp, make the clip hit
Aimin' at his top, boy you need a mop
Man, I'm goin' out with a vengeance
My pants, Raf Simons
My shoes, Rick-Rick
Your girl dipped my tartar sauce so she ate my dick like a fish stick
Hit it raw, yes, I am a dog, I don't do this shit for no image
All my diamonds, they be hittin' hard
Try to play me boy, that's a scrimmage
[Chorus]
I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be riding and my doors suicide

[Verse 3]
Live it up, you can just go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Got frost on my diamonds, I'm gettin' the cake now
Now stay on your stomach, lil' bitch, when you lay down
Live it up, 'cause you can go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Frost on my diamonds 'cause I got the cake now
When you on your stomach, lil' bitch, better lay down
I'm so up and I can't turn it down
They counted me out, my whole life turned around
Clean up my diamonds, you know I got rinse it
Know my boys comin', you know they mean business
That advance that you waitin' for, already spent it
When I’m on the beat man, you know I'm gon' kill it

Title: Bean (Kobe)
Release Date: March 13, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-bean-kobe-lyrics
Song Description: Bean (Kobe) (originally titled Jellybean) is a track named after the middle name of legendary NBA player Kobe Bean Bryant, who is referenced in the song, and the nickname of his father, former professional basketball player Joe Jellybean Bryant, from which Kobes middle name originates.

The track was recorded on September 19, 2017, marking one of the first known collaborations between Lil Uzi Vert and Chicago rapper Chief Keef. It was first previewed on the same day in an Instagram story video by Keef. It was later previewed in an Instagram live video by Uzi. Originally thought to be titled Kobe Rollie by fans, the track was one of the most highly-anticipated Uzi songs for over two years, with many expecting it to land on Uzis then-upcoming Eternal Atake album.

Many fans were upset after it was absent from the final Eternal Atake track list once Uzi announced the listing on March 5, 2020. To the surprise of many fans, the next day, after the standard version of album was released and the deluxe version of Eternal Atake was announced, Uzi teased that the song would finally release on the deluxe in a tweet announcing the song:

Jellybean ( Kobe) ft @ChiefKeef
  

After fans' complaints about the tracks original album mix, Uzis go-to engineer, Kesha Lee, previewed an updated mix on her Instagram Story on March 14, 2020. The original album mix is scheduled to be replaced with her mix.
Lyrics:

Title: Baby Pluto
Release Date: March 6, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-baby-pluto-lyrics
Song Description: Dubbed the best song made by Baby Pluto since Lil Uzi Vert introduced his alter ego, Baby Pluto serves as the introduction to Uzis long-awaited sophomore studio album, Eternal Atake. The track is also the opener to the Baby Pluto third of Eternal Atake.

The aggressive banger energetically kicks off the project with a triumphant vibe, with Uzi rapping a monotone manner instead using his traditional melodic vocals. Uzi is very braggadocios on the song, flexing his sexual prowess and materialistic wealth all over the track while reasserting his position on top of the game.

The instrumental is based on that of Uzis unreleased 2017 throwaway Fast as You Can produced by Ike Beatz.

Moved to Francisville and met my real friends (Bah)
Mama said, "Stay down there 'fore you get hurt" (1600, hurt, I was)
That was way before I was Lil Uzi Vert (1600, Lil Uzi Vert)
Mama saw me in action, it could've got worse (1600)
I know that my mama, know I'm shootin' first

[Chorus]
Dear mama (Boo, bah)
I don't wanna sign off (No way)
Out here gettin' commas (Count up)
Like my dad, I'm a grinder (Oh yeah, grinder, grinder)
She don't want me locked up (Locked up)
Mama, I'm gon' wash up (Wash up, yeah)
Whip my wrist, it lock up (Yeah, okay)
All my diamonds rocked up (Oh yeah, okay)
I don't wanna sign off (Woah)
[Outro]
Dear mama (Slatt, 1600 Block)
Love you mama (That's on gang, slatt)
And grandmama (1600 Block)

Title: Do What I Want
Release Date: July 31, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-do-what-i-want-lyrics
Song Description: Do What I Want sees a positive and confident Lil Uzi Vert rap about his newfound lifestyle. The track, produced by Don Cannon and Maaly Raw, offers listeners a simple yet exciting sound.

The songs original version, which had different vocal effects, leaked a few months after the song was officially released.

While fans awaited Uzis Luv Is Rage 2 project, Uzi dropped the tracks official music video on April 27, 2017.

The music video embodies the Do What I Want lifestyle, showing Uzi enjoying the fruits of his labor by celebrating on vacation in Hawaii, chilling with his homies, and riding dirt bikes and ATVs, sticking true to his hometown roots in Philly. The videos psychedelic theme once again implies that Uzi is in his own universe, following his previous trippy music videos, Money Longer and You Was Right.

This song was also played in the commercial for Jordan Westbrook 0.2.

Title: That’s a Rack
Release Date: April 9, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-thats-a-rack-lyrics

The songs instrumental is the work of DJ Bangout and Uzis frequent collaborator Oogie Mane. It samples nm_rabbit_2_140.wav, a loop from Nick Miras The Peoples Pack loop kit.

Title: Free Uzi
Release Date: March 28, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-free-uzi-lyrics
Song Description: Free Uzi is Lil Uzi Verts first release since his September 2018 single New Patek. The instrumental, produced by DJ L Beats, was originally used in G Herbos 2012 single Gangway.

The songs title is in correlation to Uzis public struggles with Don Cannon and DJ Dramas record label, Generation Now, to which he signed to in 2015. Fans would persistently beg both Cannon and Drama to free Uzi for months, calling for the release of his forthcoming second studio album, Eternal Atake.

Due to the fact that Atlantic Records nor Generation Now authorized the songs release, Uzi uploaded Free Uzi to streaming services himself through DistroKid. As a result of this, the first service to release the song was TIDAL, which many fans assumed was in connection to his recent management deal with JAY-Zs entertainment company, Roc Nation. Throughout the day, the song was released on all remaining streaming platforms, followed by its accompanying music video directed by Qasquiat. The song, however, would be subsequently removed from all streaming platforms a day after its release, presumably by Uzis label.

Free Uzi was first previewed by Uzi in a video posted to his Instagram story on March 25, 2019. In the video, he can be seen in Roc Nation Studios, recording ad-libs over the song that would release three days later.

She said, "Baby, you know your dad a panther?"

Song Description: 444 is a reference to JAY-Z and his 13th album 4:44. JAY-Z is namechecked in the song.

The sum of 444 and 222 is 666, or the Biblical Number of the Beast, commonly associated with Satan. In 2017, a theory that Uzi was associated with Satan gained traction online, citing evidence such as the similarity between Lucifer and Lil Uzi Vert. Uzi also wears an inverted cross, or the Cross of Saint Peter, as part of a necklace. Even though the symbol has its roots as a Christian symbol, it is also used to express anti-Christian sentiment and is popular in punk rock, a genre that Uzi draws inspiration from.



This song title, as well as some of the iconography from LUV is Rage 2 depicting Uzi with wings and horns, shows Uzi acknowledging or even embracing the theory.

Title: Silly Watch
Release Date: March 6, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-silly-watch-lyrics
Song Description: Silly Watch is yet another song focused on watches by Lil Uzi Vert. The track features Uzi in a similar, braggadocious mood to much of the first third of the album, or the Baby Pluto portion of the album. He raps in a cutthroat manner over a dark beat about his material wealth and sexual prowess with women.

Silly Watch was teased countless times before its release on Eternal Atake. The track, prior to its release on the album, was known to fans as 40 Glock. However, producer Supah Mario tweeted in a now-deleted tweet that 40 Glock doesnt exist, leading fans to discover that the track was actually called Silly Watch once Eternal Atakes track listing was released on March 5, 2020.

Title: Zoom
Release Date: June 30, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-zoom-lyrics
Song Description: Zoom was originally previewed in a since-deleted Instagram post made by Lil Uzi Vert nearly a month after the release of his debut studio album Luv is Rage 2, which featured the caption:

Just a Vibe .vs2 ?

This caption would spark the assumption that the song would land on a forthcoming, as-of-yet unreleased, sequel to his Lil Uzi Vert Vs. The World mixtape from 2016.

In July 2019, FaZe Clan member Nordan, better known as FaZe Rain, took to Snapchat and played part of the song. He later joked about dropping it, however, he then went back on it, saying he didnt want to do Uzi like that. Despite this, the song later leaked externally on August 10, 2019. It appears quite unfinished, featuring mostly the same lyrics looping throughout the track.

Over a very bass-heavy beat scarce of instruments, Uzi raps ruthlessly about topics typical to his rap such as material wealth in the form of jewelry and cars as well as a female named Nicki who is referenced all over the track.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
I got one girl from Philly, I think her name Nicki
And I fuck with Nicki 'cause she not too picky
And she not too choosy, but sometimes she bougie
I play with her kitty until it get sticky
I'm movin' the bitch just like an alien
Chop with a fifty, my Uzi Israeli
See, I turned to the boss, can't deal with no middleman
Anthony Davis, don't deal with the Pelicans (What?)
Straight out the mud, we got that work that turn you to the Grudge
Leave you slime like a snail, you get hit with these slugs
I say how I feel and I do what I want
And not just because it is what it was
I'm high like a bird, man, but don't got no Lugz
Know you heard what I said, got this shit out the mud
I'm not in these streets, I'm just close with the plug
I just saw his mother, I gave her a hug

[Verse 1]
If you talkin' 'bout the work, nigga, just hide that, supply that
Stuff a hundred rounds in the compact, contact
I probably fucked the bitch from your hometown projects
Opened up her mouth, put my dick all inside that
She don't get high, but she geeked off the contact
That's why I'll never, ever, ever keep in contact (Yeah)
Just closed case, so a nigga can't find that, baby, where your mind at?
Come here, girl, sign that, matter fact, oh, never mind then
Front door, find that after the climax
And she screamin' my name every time we behind it
When I heard the door, get up, baby, where my nine at?
Water on my neck, 3D like it's IMAX (Water)
Diamonds turned a bird to a goddamn blind bat
Ass so fat that I got to hit beside that
Heard a nigga put his Lamb' trucks on finance (Finance)
Woah (No, no, no), y'all niggas insane
No, we're not the same, I'm more like a big body (Skrrt), you like a Range
These niggas, they frauds, they repping my gang (Vroom)
Like, what's up with that? (No, for real)
I just pulled up Maybach, yeah, and that shit all matte black, yeah

Forty-five-hundred for some Margiela kick-offs
Got the yellow diamond Patek on my wrist, too pissed off
Laughin' to the bank, it's funny (Ha-ha)
Go get you some, go get your own money
Hold on, I got you with some loan money
No, matter fact, you ain't help me when I had no money
Three-hundred thousand, yeah, that's your money
Twenty more million, that's tour money
If you fuck me good, that's your money (Woah)

Title: Sasuke
Release Date: April 24, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-sasuke-lyrics
Song Description: Sasuke is the first single by Lil Uzi Vert following his March 2020 album, Eternal Atake, and its deluxe edition, Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2. The title is an ode to Sasuke Uchiha, a character in Naruto, the anime and manga series. Uzi has had a continued and documented infatuation with anime.

On the song, Uzi raps about his usual topics of sex, weapons, and wealth, but he also makes references to Sasuke and the Naruto series.

During the week leading up to the singles release, Uzi hinted at the songs title with a series of tweets referencing Sasuke as his new alter-ego, following his Orenji and Baby Pluto monikers from earlier in 2020. Sasuke is Uzis second Naruto-influenced alter-ego, as Orenji was based upon Pain, a villain in the series.

The single also arrives amidst a dispute between Uzi and his former close collaborator, Playboi Carti. On March 19, 2020, Uzi tweeted that he would drop more music as soon as an unnamed individual dropped music of their own, which many assumed was a subtle shot at Carti.

After Carti released his single, @ MEH, on April 16, Uzi began to promote his own music in correlation with everything that Carti posted on social media. Uzi announced this single about four hours before its release by unveiling its artwork. Uzi notably takes from Cartis style in this track, from the use of Cartis adlibs to his mimicking of Cartis baby voice.

Uzi and Carti ultimately squashed their beef on April 25, hours after this track was released.

Title: I’m Sorry
Release Date: March 6, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-im-sorry-lyrics
Song Description: This track ends the section of Baby Pluto songs and begins the Renji section of the album, one of Uzis personalities who he has described as being the more sweet and nice side of his personality.

Since Renji is a reflection of Uzis softer side, the track is an apology to a past lover with whom Uzis relationship went sour. The line thats why you cant fuck with fans is a clear sign that this song is about Brittany Byrd, one of Uzis ex-girlfriends. He has discussed their relationship in many songs, including 20 Min from Luv is Rage 2, where he tells the story of him meeting her in the crowd at one of his shows. The cover art of the first Luv Is Rage album is also a depiction of this happening.

This song is an apology to Brittany, apologizing for potentially being misleading and letting his fame affect their relationship together.

The Renji section of the album ends with Prices, with Urgency being the first song off of the albums Uzi section. Uzi confirmed this on Twitter the day of the albums release.

And you didn't come here for me, let's talk about it

You ain't say, "Oh I'm coming this day, I'm coming that"
You sit here and you tell me one thing and you always do another
'Cause, cause let me know, let me... let me tell you why
'Cause you're not a man of your word
That's - that's the reason why. So let's talk about it
Oh, you come here for nothing
No, you came here for what?
Whatever you came here for
So, whatever
You have no type of communication at all
So get up out my comments

Song Description: Just Wanna Rock, the lead single to Lil Uzi Verts Pink Tape, sees Uzi introduce a fresh sound away from the trap genre, moving closer to Jersey Club, a sort of electronic club music.

The short track sees Uzi battle a loud beat as they prolong their distorted cadence to build pressure and intensity until the song reaches its climax  as the beat drops.

Before its release, the song would be heard for the first time on September 14, 2022, through a fan page on Instagram that Lil Uzi Vert frequently experiments with. A snippet of the track would eventually go viral, leading to the official release.

The official Gibson Hazard-directed music video was released a month after the song, on November 18, 2022. The video sees Uzi  alongside hundreds of people  parading through New York City with appearances from media personalities such as Kai Cenat.

What about the times you looked at me like you loved me, gave me the face

I might even hold you close like you my antidote
Understand you let me go, but you still at my show

Yeah, they getting wild, yeah, she getting wild
Thought of something important baby, it is nothing now
It is nothing now, I said it is nothing now
And I thought they just was hating, no, they wasn't hating
I was just on wait and you was contemplating
We was in the same book, but we different pages
We was in the same book, but we different pages
Better yet, we like the same, she my other half

Never took it serious, we slept in on Bape clothes

Title: Dolly
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-dolly-lyrics
Song Description: Dolly is a leaked song by Lil Uzi Vert, originally thought to have been produced by Bugz Ronin, but recent findings suggest it was instead produced by C4Bombs, with the help of BRackz.

The song seems to make references to Uzis frequent collaborator, Young Thug, and his younger sisters Dolly White (as per the title of the song and its chorus) and Dora.

The song was first teased by Uzi in early 2018 with fans expecting it to appear on either Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2, or some other upcoming project. Before this could happen, however, Music Mafia put the song up for the sale on their site.

The song was purchased from Music Mafia and it leaked online on July 16, 2018.

The song was remixed by Uzi and Lil Tecca and officially released as Dolly on September 18, 2020. It was included as the tenth track from Teccas debut studio album Virgo World.

Title: Suicide Doors
Release Date: June 30, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-suicide-doors-lyrics
Song Description: On Suicide Doors, Lil Uzi Vert likens themself to the late Brandon Lees character The Crow from the 1994 gothic film, whilst also rapping about women and bragging about their rise to fame.

The song is introduced by a short clip of Charleston White, a reformed former gang member, now internet personality and CEO, making fun of Uzi and their distinct style as a rapper.

However, Uzi seemingly uses this song to reject these criticisms which have been heavily present throughout their career, especially in recent years. Throughout the song, Uzi asserts their identity and doesnt shy away from the reproval they have faced from the media.

The song was debuted at their Summer Smash 2023 set in Bridgeview, Illinois on June 24, 2023, and once again previewed during Pink Tapes trailer uploaded on June 26, 2023 before its official release.

Title: Strawberry Peels
Release Date: March 13, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-strawberry-peels-lyrics
Song Description: Strawberry Peels is a hyper-aggressive banger from Lil Uzi Vert and frequent collaborators and YSL members Gunna and Young Thug. The three rap in a very braggadocios manner about topics from heavy drug use to flexing their expensive jewelry, all over a chaotic beat featuring heavily-distorted bass and a repeating industrial, screeching tone.

The songs title, Strawberry Peels, is actually a censorship of the phrase strawberry pills, which refers to a collection of red-colored pills. Various other drugs, including lean and weed, are also mentioned throughout the song.

Censoring explicit words and drugs in song titles for public relations purposes is common in hip-hop, a genre that can frequently discuss more mature topics like drug use. It also recently happened to the title of Migos February 2020 single, Give No Fxk, which Thug appeared on as a featured artist.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Young Thug]
Spider (Hey)
Hey (SEX, Spider, SEX)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]

Smoke on that thrax, I'm on strawberry peels
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels

Strawberry peels
Cop what I want and my wrist and my style is on crunk and it's real
Half of my niggas get high off a seal

I cannot breathe 'cause there's ice on my gills
She give me brain, that's that Urkel and chill
She mixed with white, told her my name Jaleel
Uzi too rich, man, how does it feel?
Tryna be humble, man, I ain't tryna kill
They walk on my heels, my heels made of steel
That's no oil my spill, I burnt off the wheel
She ate up the deal
My baby so spoiled just like some old milk
The paint on my whip, it's already peeled
Put my dick in her gut, it's just for the guilt
Fuckin' this bitch, did that right on film
I need the beat, that's just for the stems (Yeah)
[Chorus: Young Thug & Lil Uzi Vert]
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels (Yeah)
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels (Yeah)
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels (Yeah)

Louis my shoes
Pull out my whip on twenty-twos
I saw your girl, I had to scoop
Just like a bird, she gonna swoop
Neck is achoo, might catch the flu
Banana clip straight from the zoo

[Verse 1]
I'm like Mother Goose, if I say shoot, they gonna shoot
No, I'm not sweet, I just got flavor
Don't need no water to mix up this juice
They say, "Why your chain it look like a choker?"
That's for the slaves that had to wear the noose
Uh, no, you can't cuff me, baby, let me loose
The way that I live, baby, that's a roof
Matchin' closet, it came with a pool
Bro moving 8 balls, not no pool
If you ask me his name then I don't have a clue (Woah)
Make 'em hit the folks every time that I shoot
Too much money, I'm evil from the root
Yeah, my shows they bust right through the roof
Saw your crowd at your concert on snooze
I'm a dog, bitch, I howl at the moon
I remember when I didn't have cable
That was back when I used to watch Zoom

Oh, that's 'cause her jeans, they from Rhude
You better have you a real good excuse
He want the smoke, but I don't got a Juul

Title: Watch This
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-watch-this-lyrics
Song Description: Watch This is an unreleased track from Philadelphia rapper Lil Uzi Vert. On the track, Uzi boasts about his exorbitant wealth and flexes his loyal fanbase to his opposition, in addition to bragging about his sexual prowess and material possessions.

The track was first previewed on March 12, 2019, during an Instagram Live session that was hosted by Uzi. The song was allegedly intended at one point to serve as a single for Eternal Atake, Uzis second studio album, but these plans were later scrapped for unknown reasons, and the track was omitted from the final tracklist of Eternal Atake.

The track was later leaked in its entirety on April 7, 2022. Due to a long-existing conflict between Uzi and the tracks co-producer Forza, which stemmed from Forzas unauthorized selling of other unreleased tracks recorded by Uzi in 2019, it is highly unlikely that the song will ever see an official release.
Lyrics:

Title: Heavy Metal

Song Description: Heavy Metal is a single from Lil Uzi Vert, collaborating for the first time with fellow rappers Lil Keed and Lil Gotit.

In the track, Uzi compares himself to a heavy metal rock-star, based on a genre very popular in the late eightys and ninetys. Heavy metal was characterized by highly intense musicians and hardcore lyrics. Lil Uzi Vert is actually a major fan of one such artist, Marilyn Manson, and actually spent over twenty thousand dollars on a diamond chain to commemorate the artist.

Five-seveN, Five-seveN, Five-seveN, Five, FN bust your top, yeah
Put it right in her neck just like a tie
I go to her crib just with my fire
I got a thot live on my opp's block
She always give up the drop (Drop)
We always gon' be on top
Whether you like it or not (Not, not)
My chain too cold, but I'm hot, made it colder
Hit from the back, she made me say, "Woah, there" (Let's go)
I hit that girl, made her pull her rotor (Okay)
I hit that, then I had break my shoulder (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Open up a loaf of bread, then spread it out (Out)
I remember I almost ain't make it out (Out)
You too old, you just keep tryna burn it out (Oh)
She said, "Lil Uzi, please, can you eat me out?" (Yeah)
I said, "No, I cannot, I could beat it out" (Ew)
Put it in her, she screamin' like, "Take it out" (Ouch)
There's no feelings with no, um, relations now (Yeah)
I had got money, then took the paper route (Let's go)
My deposit, it look just look like my saving now (Yeah)
Get hit with a charge, my boy gon' take it now (Woo)
But don't worry, 'cause we gonna break him out
Cook the crack like a chef, so I base it out (Master chef)
Okay, my, my, my, my, that's my baby now (My, my, my)
Keep it on the low 'cause that's your lady now (Yeah)
I just made me a hundred and eighty now
That's how much the promoter be payin' now (Lil Uzi)
[Verse 2: Young Nudy]
Hahaha, I got your bitch over here promotin' my nuts (I got your bitch)
Yeah, your ho is a slut, hit her from the back, nigga, in her guts (Give me that)
Yeah, slap it on her butt, whole lotta white stuff on her butt (Yeah)
I know that ho freaky, she's a nut (Yeah)
She just sucked me up, young nigga goin' nuts (Uh-huh)
Uh, Glock 17 holdin' the nuts, y'all niggas really frontin' for what?
Get a pussy nigga bust for nothin' (Fah-fah)
All that talkin', need to hush it, bluffin'
Kill a nigga for the money, frontin'
In the hood, hoes stuntin', money (Stuntin')
In the booty club throwin' money (Money)
Just like a diamond, nigga, know I'm shinin'
And I do this shit Monday through Sunday
Y'all broke as fuck, can't get no money (Huh?)
I'm laughin', these niggas, they ain't doin' nothin' (Nah)
Yeah, I smoke big blunts, I smoke big blunts, bitch, I big stunt
Everybody know that Slime got a big gun
Niggas be playin', when I point my finger, they gon' shoot somethin' (Fah-fah)

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Open up a loaf of bread, then spread it out
I remember I almost ain't make it out
You too old, you just keep tryna burn it out
She said, "Lil Uzi, please, can you eat me out?"
I said, "No, I cannot, I could beat it out" (No)
Put it in her, she screamin' like, "Take it out"
There's no feelings with no, um, relations now
I had got money, then took the paper route
My deposit, it look just look like my saving now
Get hit with a charge, my boy gon' take it now (Yeah)
But don't worry, 'cause we gonna break him out
Cook the crack like a chef, so I base it out (Let's go)
Okay, my, my, my, my, that's my baby now
Keep it on the low 'cause that's your lady now (Let's go)
I just made me a hundred and eighty now
That's how much the promoter be payin' now (Yeah)
