Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I watched you change
Into a fly
I looked away
You were on fire

[Chorus]
And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

[Verse 2]
I took you home
Set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
Then I laughed

And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings

Title: Sextape
Release Date: May 4, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-sextape-lyrics
Song Description: Frontman Chino Moreno discussed this lament about spiritual isolation with Artist Direct. Said Moreno: I love that one; it jumps around a lot. I was going to fix it so every verse told one cohesive story, but I decided that I really like it the way it is. Its really fragmented. Pieces of information are in different placesunder the water and in the city. Its broad, and it feels really good. It adapts to the overall vibe. It has a night time feel to it as well. Weve been playing it in rehearsal and I realized how much I like it now. When I first wrote it, I thought, You could tell this is one of my songs. Its probably the most Team Sleep-esque song on the record. I didnt want it to be too self-indulgent right off the bat or for people to think, This is Chino just being Chino. Really its not; everybody contributes on that song fairly equally. I wrote the opening riff, but the song grew from everybody building on to that. Its more of a Deftones song than people might believe it is. Playing the song in rehearsal, it sounds mighty. For the simple fact that it doesnt have any crush guitar, screaming or anything aggressive on it, Sextape sounds really big.

Title: My Own Summer (Shove It)
Release Date: October 28, 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-my-own-summer-shove-it-lyrics
Song Description: The first track and lead single from Deftones' sophomore album Around the Fur.

Chino has said that the song refers his displeasure with the sun after long nights of recording and it burning his eyes, resulting in him putting tin foil over the windows to block it out.

However he has also said the song is about how agitated he became whilst touring during summer, the intense heat and crowds of people irritating him.

The song is one of Deftones' most famous, despite not charting in the US. It received considerable airplay on MTV and reached #29 in the UK.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Hey you, big star
Tell me when it's over

[Verse 2]
Hey you, big mood
Guide me to shelter
'Cause I'm through when the two
Hits the six and it's summer

Title: Cherry Waves
Release Date: October 31, 2006, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-cherry-waves-lyrics
Song Description: 4th song of the album Saturday Night Wrist.
Singer Chino Moreno has stated this song is about testing the trust a person has in someone else.

Cherry Waves is somewhat of a metaphor for blood in an ocean. Chino repeatedly drops subtle mentions of death throughout the song. On the other hand, the Cherry also symbolizes warmth and tenderness and love. He juxtaposes love and death throughout the song in the form of these Cherry Waves.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
A sea of waves we hug the same plank
(Saw your end)
Just as I'd rehearsed over in my brain
(Saw your end)

[Chorus]
The waves suck you in and you drown
If like, you should sink down beneath
I'll swim down, would you?
You?

[Verse 2]
You hang the anchors over my neck
(Saw your end)
I liked it at first but the more you laughed
The crazier I came

[Chorus]
The waves suck you in then you drown

Title: Passenger
Release Date: June 20, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-passenger-lyrics
Song Description: The ninth song from the groups third album White Pony, this slow-burning ballad is rife with metaphorical imagery and atmospheric musical arrangements.

While Chino Morenos symbolic lyrics are always freely up for interpretation, there are three common meanings:
1.) It is simply about sexual activity in a moving car.
2.) He is symbolically talking about willingly putting your life into someone elses hands, and just being along for the ride.
3.) This quote directly from Chino:

I did this song with Maynard from Tool. Basically, I told him I wanted to create a scenario of being in a car and being taken for a drive when you dont really know whats going on. I wanted him to create a lot of imagery. He wrote a majority of the lyrics and left blanks for me to fill in. It seems like youre being held captive, but enjoy whats going on.

Passenger is notable for featuring guest vocals by Maynard James Keenan, the front-man of Tool, A Perfect Circle, and Puscifer, among other things.

On April 7, 2016, Deftones' record label released The Studio Album Collection, which is an official remaster of every studio album -
 not including B-Sides and Rarities, Covers, and Gore.

On some songs, there are new elements to be heard that are nonexistent on the original version. In the original mastering stage, there may be some parts the band and producer were wanting to leave out or forgot to put in.

After the final line of the song, there is an additional vocal added from Chino. He has done this live in older shows, but it was not audible in the original record.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chino Moreno and Maynard James Keenan]
Here I lay
Still and breathless
Just like always
Still, I want some more
Mirrors sideways
Who cares what's behind?
Just like always
Still your passenger

[Pre-Chorus]
Chrome buttons
Buckles and leather surfaces
These and other
Lucky witnesses
Now to calm me
This time, won't you, please
Drive faster?

[Chorus 1: Maynard James Keenan]
Roll the window down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees anything?

Drive faster?

Roll the window down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees what tonight?
Roll these misty windows
Down to catch my breath and then
Go and go and go
Just drive me home and back again

Title: Digital Bath
Release Date: June 20, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-digital-bath-lyrics
Song Description: Upon first listen, Digital Bath is a hauntingly beautiful song that could be played during a late-night cruise.

One critic says:

Digital Bath, Knife Prty, and Change are all defined by the ghostly samples in the background that perfectly match Chinos vocals and the wonderful harmonic phrasing on those songs.

Diving farther into the song, however, we learn that it is about luring a girl into a bathtub, killing her with an electrical device, and then dressing her back up.

Chino Moreno, lead vocalist of Deftones, on Digital Bath:

The song itself, if you took the lyrics out of it and you listen to just the melodies and the song, you wouldnt think that it would be a violent song. Its a prettier, spacier song.

A separate quote from Chino from the same source:

It was probably 5 in the morning  we were still up partying  and I just pictured this whole scenario of having this girl, bringing her downstairs and taking a bath and like, out of nowhere, just reaching back and electrocuting  basically throwing some kind of electrical device in the bathtub and then taking her out of the bath and drying her off and putting her clothes back on.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You move like I want to
To see like your eyes do
We are downstairs
Where no one can see
New life break away

[Chorus]

Title: 7 Words
Release Date: December 17, 1995, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-7-words-lyrics
Song Description: 7 Words is the first single of Deftones' first studio album, Adrenaline.

It is one of the few songs of that era that are still played at Deftones' shows. It is a common set-closer.

The song title refers to the police statement, You have the right to remain silent.

In an interview, frontman Chino Moreno goes into detail:

I wrote it back when I was 16 years old. Its probably one of the angriest songs Ive ever written. It was about being oppressed by people around me, the authorities, I felt like the whole world was against me. It was like I was lashing out at those people."

A common meaning of the song is about police lashing out against minorities only due to their style or skin color, when they have done nothing wrong at all.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'll never be the same, break in decency
Don't be tree trunk, don't fall on my living roots
I've been humming too many words, got a weak self-esteem
That's been stomped away from every single dream
But it's something else that brought us fees
Keep it all inside 'til we feel we can't unleash
But I think that you made it up, I think that your mind is gone
I think you shouldn't have glorified, now you're wrong!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You and me, out here alone
Face flat along the edge of the grass
But I'm not here to preach, I'm just sick of looks
My parents made me strong to look up that glass
So why should I try? Act like I'm a little pissed off
With all that shit that needs to stay back in the shell

Well, I'll tell you about my blunt stack
What's coming back, Jack? We'll turn back
Curse, fighting their words, tell them that you fucking heard
I mean, they know that's what's coming, nigga, you quitter
I'm thinking about something naughty and won't tell anybody
So, thinking of me by now, but you go grab it
I'd like to think, for who I down this shit
I belong where they be
Because we cannot get back those lives

God hates black shades and all the clergy

Shorty done crushed all of my brothers' dignity
And to the jury, carry your turns on my skin this color
Does that mean I'm burnt?

Title: Knife Prty
Release Date: June 20, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-knife-prty-lyrics
Song Description: Knife Prty is the seventh track of Deftones' third studio album, White Pony. The song features vocals from female singer Rodleen Getsic

The opening chords for Knife Prty lead into a distorted introduction with a moving bass line and a vocal bridge sung by Getsic in Spanish-Arabic style

says one critic.

Chino Moreno, the frontman of Deftones, had this to say:

Its a seductive song with a lot of violent imagery. People dont tend to like sex mixed with violence. The mid section has amazing vocals from a girl called Rodleen who worked next door to our studio

The inspiration for this song was a strange party on the bands tour bus once, where a everyone had a knife from Abes knife collection and was dancing around the bus with them. Chino then created an imaginary scenario from it about a secret knife society.

I made up this fake scenario of some kind of underworld society of knives, people who just get off on these erotic fantasiesor something like that. An Eyes Wide Shut kind of thing

Chino says.

Symbolically speaking, it is an intimate story where a man (in this case, Chino) and a woman build their attraction. They either get high off of each others aurora, or with the use of drugs.

They both climax (potentially in different ways), and Chino is left wanting more.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
My knife, it's sharp and chrome
Come see inside my bones
All the fiends are on the block
I'm the new king, I'll take the queen
'Cause in here, we are all anemic

Song Description: Chino has said that this was song was about the first day of school. But these lyrics hint that maybe theres something more to them.

Chinos (unconfirmed) explanation:

The title comes from a Kool Keith song. We just thought it was some funny stuff. The song is meant to be triumphant. Im trying to spread a little confidence. Lots of artists try to make songs for the kids who are tormented in school, telling them its okay to be tormented. But its not okay. Dont be ridiculed. Become the leader of your surroundings. Confidence is one of the most important things in life. If you are confident, you can do whatever you want.
Lyrics:

I'll stick you a little
Enough to take your oxygen away

Title: Diamond Eyes
Release Date: May 4, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-diamond-eyes-lyrics
Song Description: This is the opening track to Deftones sixth album Diamond Eyes. Diamond Eyes being the first album to be recorded without their former bassist, Chino probably wanted to make his old friend a tribute.

Although there is no clear proof that this song is about their former bassist Chi Cheng, there are several references to death and or coma. This is sung with hope that they will eventually see each other again.

At the time of the albums release, Chi Cheng was in a state of coma after a car accident that occurred in 2008 and it was unsure whether or not he would make it through.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
To the edge, till we all get off
I will take you away
With me, once and for all

[Chorus]
Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
Shower me into the same realm

[Verse 2]
Calculate our embrace, hold on
Come with me now
Run away, outer space
With me, once and for all

Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
Shower me into the same realm
Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
I will lead us to the same realm

Title: Around the Fur
Release Date: October 28, 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-around-the-fur-lyrics
Song Description: This song uses a fur coat as a metaphor for beauty and vanity. Fur coats are beautiful and soft on the outside, but when you come around the fur you find the dead and ugly skin. Chino is comparing people who are vain to a fur coat, saying they can be beautiful on the outside, but dead and ugly on the inside.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Hey, vanity
This vial's empty, so are you
Hey, glamorous
This vial's not God anymore, yeah

[Chorus]
Speak! I don't get it
Should I ignore the fashion or go by the book?
I don't want it
I just want your eyes fixated on me
Coming back
I'm coming back around the fur

[Verse 2]
Prostitute, climb back down
From the floor
Please don't fuck around
And die like this
'Cause I love her

[Chorus]
Speak! I don't get it
Should I ignore the fashion or go by the book?
I don't want it
I just want your eyes fixated on me

Title: Entombed
Release Date: November 9, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-entombed-lyrics
Song Description: Arguably one of Deftones' most beautiful song, Entombed is the fifth track in their seventh studio album Koi No Yokan. With a hypnotizing melody and a shimmering tone, the song succinctly captures the feeling of being deeply in love.

Although the title might seem counterintuitive for the themes it explores, Chino Moreno clarified that this choice was intentional: Its more of describing being in a safe place, and safe-keeping and being cherished and heldits not supposed to be creepyits another way of describing being kept in a special place. I love playing with those contrasts.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
From the day you arrived
I've remained by your side
In chains, entombed

Shapes and colors are all I see

Title: Rx Queen
Release Date: June 20, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-rx-queen-lyrics
Song Description: RX Queen is the fourth track off of Deftones' third album, White Pony.

Featuring an uncredited Scott Weiland on additional vocals in the chorus, the song delves into staying in a relationship that ultimately hurts both people involved.

The protagonists girlfriend is addicted to prescription drugs and while it pains him to see her in that state, he helps feed her addiction, buying more to keep her satisfied.

By the end of the song, the girlfriend is killed when she overdoses, leaving the protagonist with nowhere to go but to reminisce on the memories of his time with her.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I won't stop following you
Now help me pray for
The death of everything new
Then we'll fly farther

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my girl, and that's all right
If you sting me, I won't mind

[Verse 2]
We'll stop to rest on the moon
And we'll make a fire
I'll steal a carcass for you

Title: Minerva
Release Date: April 29, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-minerva-lyrics
Song Description: Minerva is the lead single from Deftones self-titled fourth studio album. The name comes from Minerva, the Roman Goddess of wisdom, war, art, schools, and commerce. She was the Etruscan counterpart to the Greek Athena.

Although the self-titled album is one of Deftones' heaviest, this song is more characteristic of shoegaze.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I get all numb
When she sings that "It's over"
Such a strange numb
And it brings my knees to the earth

[Chorus]
And God bless you all
For the song you sang us

You're the same numb
When you sing "It's over"

Title: Lhabia
Release Date: October 28, 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-lhabia-lyrics
Song Description: Lhabia is the second track from Deftones' sophomore effort Around the Fur. The most interesting thing about this track is the distorted lyrics that lead singer Chino Moreno whispers almost as if they are said through gritted teeth. These whispered lyrics are not actually printed in the official lyric booklet that comes with the album and are quite difficult to understand in live performances.

This song dwells on the topic of drugs. Its on the reflection of taking drugs and craving all the effects that come with them.

Despite the damaging effects of drugs, many people take them out of boredom, apathy, anger, etc.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Somewhere, outside
There are tricks and evil
Holler downstairs
While I drive

[Verse 1]
I make a plan just to get you back to what we're doing
I wanna burn you, wanna watch you
You'll think again, deep within, keep it deep inside
Yeah, while I serenade, buttercup, yeah, buttercup
And we can do it, suppose it again
Oh, slow it down and then we'll do it again and again
And make the best of a simple thing
To believe this, bound, coming through the fog

[Chorus]
Dying of boredom
I'll try it all

[Interlude]
Sixteen, olive
Bound by voice

[Verse 2]
I bleed again like a girl that can make 'em turn
Don't look, but I want it
Too much blood into my stomach, it's because it's sick
Pass through, break the bands between us
I can dare to go, but never what you can't do
What you get is never what you want to get
Now to pray your sigh is over like a doped drug
Like a voice, well, at least you fucking care

But that's okay, 'cause look at how it feels

[Verse 3]
Burn God down, starts to stir again
Fucking heretic, I've opened up this for me
Lack of sterile, I'll stack the bricks down
Hurt you too much, I'm working 'round to
I can punch through it, make the hair stick
Don't wanna hurt you, just to fuck you
I'm out of time, so I tell her to rest and to
I'll rely on these two and be fine

[Chorus]

I'll be faint

Title: Back to School (Mini Maggit)
Release Date: March 12, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-back-to-school-mini-maggit-lyrics
Song Description: Back to School (Mini Maggit) is an abridged  version of the song Pink Maggit, which was released as both a 3-song single and an 8-song EP.  Commercially successful and achieving radio play, Maverick Records decided to released the bands third album White Pony, with the song as a bonus track.


This album right here is not the album that we turned into the label. As far as were concerned, the first edition was the record. Done. Then they talked us into re-releasing it with another song on it, and its not like Im against the song or whatever, but I liked the sequence we had when we first turned it in. When this version came out, a little part inside all of us felt like: Fuck! We just totally compromised. And I know that a lot of our fans felt bad about it too.

Back to School was a mistake. A calculated song, that had been built up with only one aim in mind: It should be a single.  Back to School was released because I was an idiot. I wanted to prove something [to the record company]. Months later, after White Pony was released, they wanted us to do a new version of Pink Maggit. They said we lost our heaviness, and there were no more singles on the album. First, I wanted to stick this idea up my ass, but then I thought: Im gonna show those fuckers how easy it is to create a hit-single. And so I rapped a hip hop part on that song, we shortened it and half an hour later, the hit-single was ready to roll on.
- Chino Moreno
Lyrics:

[Intro]
So run
Run, right back to school
Check it

[Verse 1]
Look back, I sift through all the cliques
Roamin' the halls all year, making me sick
While everyone's out trying to make the cut (What)
And when you think you know me right, I switch it up
Behind the walls, smokin' cigarettes and sippin' vodka
I hop a fence to catch a cab, ain't no one can stop us
Give me a break about some other mess
What were you? Act like it's everything you got

[Chorus]
Push back the square
Now that you need her but you don't
So there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all, so

[Verse 2]
Stop that quit, all that quit
Who ruined it? You did, now grab a notebook and a pen
Start taking notes on me and everyone who's on the top
You think we're on the same page, but I know we're not
I'll be the man, watch your backpacks, pens, and pencils
Just like Keith, I'm flippin' it, while you just keep it simple
You just can't go on rocking the clothes
Coppin' the stance, 'cause really it's everything that you're not

Title: Bored
Release Date: April 4, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-bored-lyrics
Song Description: Originally called Oraled in the early 90s, Bored is the first song and second/last single off of Adrenaline.

Chino Moreno talked about the struggle of naming songs, including this song, in an interview with SPIN magazine:

Its funny, cuz early on, I used to butt heads with the A&R guy at Maverick Records, because I would always try to name the songs something way off, something different. Even the song Bored, you know, the chorus goes, I get bored, I get bored, I get bored. So me, the song was called something else, [and] he goes, You gotta call the song Bored I was like, What about Radiohead? They have that song Paranoid Android. I was like, When do they say Paranoid Android in the song? [They dont], but doesnt it just draw you in?

The single was released on April 4th, 1996, and featured a music video directed by Nick Egan.

Title: Feiticeira
Release Date: June 20, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-feiticeira-lyrics
Song Description: Chino Moreno sings here from the perspective of a person who has been kidnapped. He explained on Deftones World: Its named after a Brazilian female, but its lyrically about a kidnapping scenario. It details a few hours of being held captive. Theres a lot of dialogue in there that was fun to write.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Fuck, I'm drunk, but I'm on my knees
The police stopped chasing
I'm her new, cool meat
She pops the trunk, and she removes me
And a machine takes pictures of us
Now my jaw and my teeth hurt
I'm choking from gnawing on the ball

[Hook]
And just before I come to
Move to the back of the car
She made me touch the machine
New murderer, fuck 'em

[Verse 2]
First, untie me
Untie me for now
You said you would, right?
And you were right

(Soon, I'll let you go; soon, I'll let you go)

Title: Elite
Release Date: June 20, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-elite-lyrics
Song Description: Elite is the third track from American alternative metal Deftones' third album White Pony, their highest selling album to date. While the album marked a significant growth in the bands sound, incorporating new wave, dream pop, trip hop, and shoegazing influences, this song hearkened back to the bands previous style of searing vocals coupled with a heavy, distorted guitar riff that drives the song, most reminiscent of earlier songs such as Headup and My Own Summer (Shove It).

The enhanced CD physical release showcases an edited rehearsal of the song as well as a full-length rehearsal which can be viewed after completing Joystick, a game portion of the enhanced material. The game plays similarly to Pac-Man, with the player controlling the white pony on the cover artwork and avoiding the heads of the Deftones members while collecting music notes to a MIDI of My Own Summers verse riff. The full-length clip is shown after beating the sixth level.

It also provided the band with their only Grammy Award up to this point, winning for Best Metal Performance at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2001.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
We're surrounded by debris of the past
And it's too late to cause a change in the tides
So we slip into our hopeless sea of regret as I stare

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the haunted maze in your eyes
Right through where I'll remain for all time

[Chorus 1]
And time won't change this
This promise we made
Yeah, the time won't change this
It's how it'll stay

[Verse 2]
This is our time, we devour the days ahead
We've been possessed by these changing times
As we slip on through, we promised to meet again somewhere

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the haunted maze in our minds
Right through where we shall remain for all time

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, time won't change this
This promise we made
And time won't change this
We shall remainSee Deftones LiveGet tickets as low as $41You might also like7Embed

Title: You’ve Seen the Butcher
Release Date: May 4, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-youve-seen-the-butcher-lyrics
Song Description: This entire album tells one continuing story. By the time we reach track 5, Youve Seen the Butcher, we start to see that sex is starting to break down the relationship, because they are more attracted to the idea of it rather than the meaning behind it.

This song is very sexual in nature. It is present in the structure and execution of it collectively.

The person you show during the act of sex, can be a person you choose to be. Much like all other instances of existence, it can either be an act or be real. This entire album I feel, deals with the concept of opening up and being comfortable with who you are in all regards.

Having said that, this track in particular deals with the very bare element of being more attracted to the act as apposed to the person putting on the act. Impression is something that a person seems put great thought into as a way of gaining acceptance or connection (physically, mentally) and although the person is hidden beneath the persona they put on, it is something you have to appreciate and work with before they will allow you to see the person underneath.

In a casual sex relationship, over time, regardless of whether you want it to or not. The physical act soon starts to hint at emotional bond and breaks a person down to reveal true emotional feelings through very physical acts. The Butcher, in my opinion is the person who unintentionally starts to break down the other.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Don't wanna take it slow
I wanna take you home
And watch the world explode
From underneath your glow

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna watch the way
You creep across my skull

[Chorus]
You slowly enter
Because you know my room
And then crawl your knees off
Before you shake my tomb

Title: Lotion

Song Description: This is the 7th track on Around The Fur. Chino said the song is aimed specifically on someone, but did not want to mention who.

We can assume its about the music industry as a whole. Judging by the lyrics Chino dislikes how unoriginal and sell-out other bands.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]

Title: Headup
Release Date: October 28, 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-headup-lyrics
Song Description: Headup is the 9th track on Deftones' sophomore LP Around the Fur. It features Max Cavalera of Soulfly on additional vocals. It was written by Max and Chino Moreno as a form of venting their pain over the loss of Maxs step-son, Dana Wells (aka D-Low), who was killed in a tragic car crash in 1996.  He was also a close friend of Chinos.

The Deftones had a super tight relationship with Dana. They had a magical thread weaving them together for their love of music.
- Gloria Cavalera (Maxs wife & Danas mom)

The bridge features lyrics written by D-Low:


When they called and asked Max to come to Seattle and collaborate on a track in Danas memory, it lifted Max and me out of the Valley of Despair. It gave us a spark of Life back

We both flew to Seattle and hooked up with the guys and met Terry Date, who was producing Around The Fur. It was exciting to be with The Deftones. Everyone had so much positive energy. Being involved in a creation from the ground floor was like being an architect constructing his masterpiece. It wasnt long before they were all digging on some music Max had brought with him. I pulled a surprise out also. I grabbed some lyrics I had found at home that Dana had written. They were written across a flier and said WALKING THROUGH THIS WORLD YOU HAVE TO HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HIGH.
- Gloria Cavalera (Maxs wife and Danas mother)




Max Cavalera and Chino collaborated again on Soulflyss second album Primitive, on a similarly themed song: Pain.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chino Moreno]
Got back out, back off the forefront
I never said or got to say bye to my boy
But it's often I try, I think about
How I'd be screaming and the times we'd be bumping
Our minds would be flowin'
Taking care of shit like, "hey homies, what ya' needin'?"
If life's comin' off whack, well, open your eyes

[Verse 2: Chino Moreno]
This has begun you seem to have some doubt
I feel you next to fiending, getting spacey
With the common love of music
Think of this as the sun and the mind as a tool
But we could bounce back from this one
With attitude, will and some spirit
With attitude, will and your spirit
We'll shove it aside

[Chorus: Chino Moreno & Max Cavalera]
How can you live with that you fucking parasite?

Title: Korea
Release Date: June 20, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-korea-lyrics
Song Description: Korea is the eighth track of Deftones' flagship album, White Pony. The bands frontman Chino Moreno is singing about his infatuation with strippers, drugs, and specifically white pony  aka cocaine.

While the album was released in 2000, Deftones have not toured South Korea until 2009. Unless they traveled there within that era, the title of the song seems to be unrelated.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]

Title: Pink Cellphone
Release Date: October 31, 2006, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-pink-cellphone-lyrics
Song Description: Pink Cellphone is a song that was recorded in 2006 on their Album Saturday Night Wrist.

The song was essentially an experimental track that is simply filled with gibberish. Pink Cellphone gained notoriety due to Annie Hardy [of Giant Drag]s outro referencing Hot Carling, anal, etc.

The band stated in an interview that they felt the song fit in with the Frankenstein mess feel to the Saturday Night Wrist album (which they disliked)

So your troubles continue to multiply and to grow as a direct result of your being misguided, deceived, misdirected or fooled
All of these are variations of the basic ego-gloried life thing in which you follow the gospel truth
Pursuing the wrong ideals and goals that lead you into sickness, unto (Fuck off), and from this sickness springs the belief in the one true power
That cure that promised to erase the symptoms that stood between you and your goal
That's seductive to hear them offer relief and comfort without disturbing the faulty system of your beliefs, the belief in the one true power
Forever and ever, one nation, under (Gnikcufttub)
The Father, the Son, and the Holy (Gnikcufttub)

It's in England. They don't have blowjobs there because they're uncircumcised, and that is just disgusting
So they have to butt-fuck, which also is disgusting because that extra foreskin traps all the germs, and the poop, and the butt-fucking residue
It's sin, and that is why British people have bad teeth

Title: Teenager
Release Date: June 20, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-teenager-lyrics
Song Description: This song is about how Chino fell for this girl (I climbed your arms), how she ignored him and didnt return that love (And you moved away), and how this killed him inside.

Written by Chino when he was only 15, it is one of the first songs that displayed Deftones' new direction in the early 2000s, as it is has strong elements of both shoegaze and trip hop influences.

This is often viewed as a spiritual predecessor to Lucky You from their self-titled album.
Lyrics:

Song Description: 10th track on Diamond Eyes

The whole album is supposed to be positive and its one of their later albums which are usually romantic. Almost the entire album feels sexual.

The song seems to be about a couple with problems in their relationship, although a lot of people have speculated that the song is about Chi Cheng,  the former Deftones bassist who has died after spending years in a coma.

Title: Phantom Bride
Release Date: April 8, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-phantom-bride-lyrics
Song Description: Phantom Bride features Jerry Cantrell, guitarist for grunge legends Alice in Chains. He takes Deftones into a realm theyve seldom explored before the guitar solo. This is another example of the band exploring their music style.

We had this space in the song and we were joking around saying what if we put a guitar solo over it? We never do guitar solos; I cant play them and Stephen probably can but he doesnt, so we never have. Its not like we dont like guitar solos, sometimes they come in and just lift a song. In a traditional sense, the third verse of a song is sort of like the guitar singing. I suggested calling Jerry to see if he would be interested in filling that space. Weve known him for years and I thought itd be rad if he could come by and just freestyle it and thats what you hear on the record.

Chino Moreno, lead singer and rhythm guitarist for the band.
Lyrics:

To spend your life safe from emotion
This way, you'll never be harmed again

Title: Street Carp
Release Date: June 20, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-street-carp-lyrics
Song Description: Street Carp is the sixth track of Deftones' flagship album, White Pony.

The song is from the lead singers point of view. Chino sees somebody in person that he used to associate himself with. An ex-girlfriend, or an old fling perhaps.

In the past, this girl was a pest, constantly creating conflicts and annoying him.  Just an obnoxious person that he couldnt shake. Chino isnt sure if he wants her to re-enter his life, and is hesitant to give out his information so that they can reconnect.

In the end, after all of the pestering, he breaks and just gives it to her. But it is now a Boy Who Cried Wolf scenario. He gave the wrong address once, and she believed him, as well as the second time. The third time, however, she argues with him, and he tries to convince her that hes being honest. Chino snaps, they bump heads, and the cycle starts over again.

A Carp is a fish that is undesirable eat or touch. That means a Street Carp, in this instance, is likely a promiscuous girl.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It's not that I care

But you're that girl

Who grabs at the walls
(And pulls meat down)

Well, here's my new address:

Title: Hexagram
Release Date: December 30, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-hexagram-lyrics
Song Description: This song is about a suicide bomber, written in the perspective of God as imagined by the bomber.

It is an interesting song as it shows an often overlooked perspective of the bombers themselves and their beliefs around the actions they perform.

The name of the song, Hexagram, is a well known religious symbol often used in Islam to represent the star of David. It is used in mosques and on religious artefacts.

It could also be interpreted as a message of disdain for the culture surrounding the US military, wherein the deaths of soldiers are upheld as necessary sacrifices against greater enemies and designated threats to the American way of life (specifically countries such as Iraq or Afghanistan, where were and still remain battlegrounds for or as a result of US military action).

Chino may be criticising a perceived lack of outrage towards the perhaps needless deaths of US citizens fighting in what he may deem a pointless and ill-conceived war founded on capitalism and fuelled by cultural and religious divisions (hence, the iconography of the hexagram) propagated by the West.
Lyrics:

Title: Tempest
Release Date: November 12, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-tempest-lyrics
Song Description: Tempest is the second single off of Deftones' Koi No Yokan.

The lyrics suggest that the song revolves around the idea of the end of the world. Considering the song was released in 2012, its safe to assume its referring to the end of the Mayan Calendar in particular.

The song has been used in the movie Jack The Giant Slayer and an episode of The Following.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Take out the stories
They've put into your mind
And brace for the glory
As you stare into the sky
The sky beneath
I know you can't be tired

[Verse 2]
Lay there, stare at the ceiling
And switch back to your time
Just go ahead and try and taste it
I know it should be ripe

Release Date: May 20, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-needles-and-pins-lyrics
Song Description: Track 2 on Deftones self-titled release is Needles and Pins. It is most likely about Chinos relationship with the crowd at a show. This is most evident in the second verse. The structure and sound of the song has been compared to My own summer (shove it).
Lyrics:

How did you come to be so blessed?

Title: Hearts / Wires
Release Date: April 4, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-hearts-wires-lyrics
Song Description: Deftones 5th track of their album Gore entitled Hearts/Wires is a true testament not only to their listeners through the various epitomes of emotion they are known to display in previous albums but of Chino Morenos visceral and impacting lyricism through songwriting.

Hearts/Wires gives meaning into how a relationship between two partners that have separated has one of the two in heartbreak and despair of ever making amends. The now ex-partner struggles to cross the barrier of their past wrongdoings in hopes of ever being together once again.

During the track, the ex-partner comes to realize they may never be together again because of their past conflicts always interrupting their relationship, hence the verse sung by Chino: No vision or dreams about you, came true for me.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Nothing can save me now
Is what I believe
The slit in the sky when you left
Is all I see
Nothing to sing about
I've bared all my leaves
No vision or dreams about you
Came true for me

[Chorus]
Cut through
This razor wire
And dine on your heart
Mine till the end

[Verse 2]
Stuck with illusion now
I drown in your sea
I hope that you'll first save yourself
And then come for me

[Chorus]
Cut through
This razor wire
And dine on your heart
Mine till the end

Title: Romantic Dreams
Release Date: November 12, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-romantic-dreams-lyrics
Song Description: With a similar  albeit chunkier  melody akin to that of Entombed, Deftones' Romantic Dreams stands as the second song in Koi No Yokan. The song itself dives deep into themes of devotion and admiration towards someone else.

The music video, directed by skater and filmmaker Brett Novak and featuring skater Jason Park, stars the latter riding in downtown Los Angeles at night, pulling tricks among numerous landmarks of the city. Chino Moreno explained the bands reluctance to create music videos for the album: [W]e didnt want to make any videos whatsoever. Theyre not much fun to make and they usually turn out pretty corny. But this was an idea that we were interested in because were all very keen skateboarders and we like the idea of marrying one of our songs to someone as talented as Jason Park.
Lyrics:

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I slipped into the cloak you left
I fiddle around in the ashtray
To find your cigarette pinkish red
I light it and take a drag

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I swear I'm losing it
With all these erased recordings, I'm rearranging parts
You should accept
We'll probably remain this way to the end, in steps

[Verse 2]
Underneath the sheets, I find your
Makeup and shoes in a bag laid open
Grab my keys and some money
And circle around the lake

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I guess you're losing it
I like to believe that maybe you're a lot likе me
Try using this equality we might need in thе air

Release Date: November 12, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-leathers-lyrics
Song Description: The first single from Deftones' seventh album, Koi No Yokan, Leathers was released roughly two months before the album itself.

This song along with the song Rosemary were later re-released together as a cas-single.

The title of the song refers to the pieces of leather clothing one would wear literally to remain unexposed.
Lyrics:

Title: What Happened to You?
Release Date: November 12, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-what-happened-to-you-lyrics
Song Description: The song What Happened to You? holds a melancholic feel throughout it, as if the speaker was talking to someone who was about to succumb to death.

Most possibly, the song is talking about Chi Cheng, who, at the time that the album Koi no Yokan was published, had been 4 years in a semi-comatose state, and only 1 year of life (since he died in 2013). The band is expressing how it has felt to have him barely conscious in a bed, how time came to a halt when they visited him, expecting his unlikely full recovery.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
In the winds of your cape
I've sailed with you
From the shore to the gates
We sway

We're alive somewhere else
Far ahead of our time

In a game of display, we break in two
We perform the ornate escape

We're alive somewhere else
Still asleep someplace new
We're ahead of our time

Song Description: The 6th track on Diamond Eyes
This song seems to be about being worshiped by die-hard fans represented in a more exaggerated sinister manner.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I relate to your kind, your design
Your devotion to wave
Get your brain on the prize
Then, dive inside

[Chorus 1]
Mindset of a killer
With your mind out of phase

[Verse 2]
It's a game that we like, we crave
Yet, nobody wins
Any way you decide, you try
But you die

[Chorus 2]
Mindset of a killer
With your gaze, you paint the room
Blood-red with your tears
Pouring from the stage

[Post-Chorus]
And you can't stop now
Rung by rung, almost out
Covered in black and gold
No one cares, no one knows
My gift to the world outside

Title: (L)MIRL
Release Date: April 8, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-lmirl-lyrics
Song Description: The eighth track off Deftones' eighth album Gore. The title is an acronym for (Lets) Meet In Real Life.

In a 2016 interview with TeamRock, Deftones frontman Chino Moreno described his inspiration behind the title.   He used the computer acronym  one commonly used in online dating sites  as a way to compare the afterlife with our current life.  Chino said:

I correlated that term LMIRL with this existence that we have now  its not real. So if we take ourselves out of this, that is real life. It wont always make sense to other people  enough for them to put that together."
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I don't miss you
I don't care where you are now
You're a ghost to me
Left with my taste in your mouth

[Refrain]
Taken away somewhere new

[Verse 2]
I'm used to it
This body is here, but I'm gone
When I reawake
I'll reawake in the waves

[Pre-Chorus]
In a new realm
Catch this dream on film
You might just get used to it
And you'll smile, smile, and dive deep

[Chorus]
I sail on these waves, hey
Slip into the calming waves, hey

Title: This Link Is Dead
Release Date: September 25, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-this-link-is-dead-lyrics
Song Description: This Link Is Dead is one of (if not the most) Deftones' most powerful and enraged songs. The songs name, This Link Is Dead, in the most simple terms; means Im out, youre on your own, which is also stated in the bridge and in the outro of the song by Deftones.

The link means a link in the chain. Theres little to no knowledge about who or what this song is specifically written against, but theres a high chance that its written against the system were living in the world right now, since everybody, after some point in their life, becomes a link in this chain of a system. With the burden it brings, one becomes full of hatred at some point and This Link Is Dead is clearly a let-out of it.

Though, with its lack of official interpretation by the artists, the song is left for the listener to interpret, whether if its for the system, or for the government, or for a specific somebody or a group, or for a former loved one.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Thanks, you want action?
Yeah, I'm aware which form you think I should try
That shit means nothin'
You see, I'm done
Right now I think it's time that you know
Pay attention
Watch me close
As I decide which fucking way I move

Song Description: Singer Chino Moreno in an interview with Artist Direct:

Sonically, thats a Stephen (Carpenter, guitar) song. A lot of people think when we have the ethereal stuff, its always me, but Stephen was playing with his pedal board and he just got on to this song. Everybody just fell into place after that, and it sounded like chaos to mebut the most romantic, dirty chaos. Lyrically, I matched it a little bit. The song is like exploding out into the night and just going for it.
Lyrics:

You arrive in my dream
Beside me every night, you and me

We try to drain the night empty

Title: Anniversary of an Uninteresting Event
Release Date: March 20, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-anniversary-of-an-uninteresting-event-lyrics
Song Description: The tenth track of Deftones' dark, gloomy, angry, and heavy self-titled album, takes an abrupt left turn with this track. It sounds beautiful and alluring, but it presents a depressing story.

The beginning of the song takes place immediately after Chino finally ends his relationship with a girl. This girl is delusional, and thinks she is always correct. She sees herself as a queen. Her mere presence and personality was becoming extremely toxic over time towards Chinos life and emotions, so he finally cut her out before he was drug down too far.

From Chinos point of view, he symbolically shares his recent experiences and thoughts with/about her. The chorus is the wave of effects she had on his life, that didnt get in his head until after she was gone, and we see the girls own point of view during the second verse. The emotional destruction that she left behind may becoming too immense for Chino, and may continue to spread her carbon footprint to other men in the future.

While they were dating, maybe even for a few years, the first day they met was always their anniversary. Now that they fought and broke up, when that day comes, it is now an anniversaryof an uninteresting event. They may have met and had a magical short while together when times were good, but it didnt amount to anything. It was uninteresting at the end of the day, to say the least.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
No more gold lights
For the queen Earth
To keep you warm
In your kingdoms

High on the waves
You make for us
But not since you left

And the rocket's rain

Title: Goon Squad
Release Date: November 12, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-goon-squad-lyrics
Song Description: Goon Squad is the 10th track on Koi No Yokan

Starting with the similar calm style as Rosemary, although it is a lot heavier.

We could interpret that the song is about Deftones as a band maturing after being together since 1988.
Throughout all those years the band has been through a lot of problems;drugs, arguments between the members and the death of their friend and bassist Chi Cheng, but they are still together.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I carve my name across your towns when I'm set
I cut inside before the trends begin
I spend my time perfecting waves of contrast
Cutting out all the same shit I've outgrown

[Chorus 1]
I'm bringing it in style myself
You know it is with ease, no sweat

[Verse 2]
I see the crowns and I forget the couture
Two at a time I watch the kingdoms fold

[Chorus 2]
I'm bringing it in style myself
You know it is with ease, no sweat
I'm breaking in with all my friends
So, are you in?

Title: Royal
Release Date: May 4, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-royal-lyrics
Song Description: The song Royal works with the imagery of a priestess coming from up high, the space even, who is prompted by the speaker to contact him and thus with humankind.

A possible interpretation can take this royal priestess to be a significant other who has so much to give but stays aloof, compelling the speaker to encourage this person to finally show off together. Ill light you up, take me up!
Lyrics:

I've sailed

Title: Lovers
Release Date: December 30, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-lovers-lyrics
Song Description: Lovers by Deftones was a song that was supposed to be on the self titled album Deftones but got cut cause it was recorded way too late. The song was also supposed to kick-off the album by being the first track, that was later taken over by Hexagram

There has also been rumors that Lovers was suppose to be the name of the now self titled album.

Even though Chino holds deep meaning and relation with each song, Chino said that the meaning of his songs are what we interpret them to be. This song is pretty rare among Deftones fans and seems to be about a man wanting a relationship with a woman.
Lyrics:

Title: Doomed User
Release Date: March 16, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Deftones-doomed-user-lyrics
Song Description: The second single of Gore is an immediate, raw burst of energy; potentially reminiscent of their Adrenaline 1995 sound.

The song sounds like an angry Chino Moreno forcing himself to give up on somebody who is a lost cause. It could be a love interest, or a family member.

They are in their own fantasy land, possibly with drugs. Metaphorically speaking if it is a girl, she thinks she is a queen. It is getting so bad, that it is now ruining Chinos life. That person deluded him/her-self to think they are right about everything, and are never in the wrong.

Chino is tired of dealing with it, and tired of watching them slowly kill themselves and ruin their lives.

He also knows that person needs him, but is too ignorant to realize it. They will however realize what they lost after he is gone. This is referenced in the line (after Chino removes them from his life): your castles are burning down on you.

He ends the song telling them to go find someone else to help you. Go make it somebody elses problem now, because you dont appreciate what I did for you, until after you lost me.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
There went your time
Say goodbye, now leave here
My fuse has expired
Fucking die, just leave here

[Verse 1]
Powerless, stuck
In your web of shit
Open your eyes
You only play yourself
Whoever's watching
I hope they catch the drift
Collect your crown
You're now the queen of filth

[Pre-Chorus]
There, that's your life
Go and die, I mean it
Loose and defiled
You define the meaning

[Chorus]
They're delusions
Don't deny it
Don't make this out to be
Something about you

I've been scarred
Fucking repulsed by this
My only tale
Is one that I can't stand
Now I've become
This core of rotted will
My heart is black
And I will now bounce back

[Pre-Chorus]
There, say goodbye
Just retire from the earth
You've been exiled
Take your body elsewhere

[Chorus]
They're delusions
Don't deny it
Don't make this out to be
Something about you
Go waste your breath somewhere
To someone new

[Interlude]
[Bridge]
Your castle has burned down on you
Your kingdom is burning down

[Chorus]
They're delusions
Don't deny it
Don't make this out to be
A thing about you
They're delusions
Don't deny it
Don't make this out to be
A thing about you
Go waste your breath somewhere
To someone new3Embed

In the haze of your light
We bathe and wane

Blow the clouds from your mouth again

Song Description: Root is the sixth track off of Adrenaline.

This song was actually sampled by Linkin Park. Chino Moreno addresses this in an interview with Kerrang!:

I didnt know that, says Chino. And whats crazy is that I didnt know that one of our managers, Mark Wakefield, was in Xero as well. I didnt know the history of that, but his nickname has since become Linkin Mark!
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
To be forced under
I look unto your home because
We gave our eyes but no one will
Yes, I know, because

[Chorus]
To heed the cause I will be barred
But you won't
We are here to love heart
He's up inside, we start to cry
Just because I will afford
Living in me is so poor
Deliver me there

[Verse 2]
To be judged by one or licked by three
And your holes enclose
We gave our eyes but no one will
Yes I know, because

[Chorus]
To heed the cause I will be barred
But you won't
We are here to love heart
He's up inside, we start to cry
Just because I will afford
Living in me is so poor
Deliver me up

We are beggars for the lord
And I will meet you fourth floor

You knock me out

I'll take the burden for the lord
And then when I'll be there, no
Do you think I care?
