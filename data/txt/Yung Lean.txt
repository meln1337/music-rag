Artist: Yung Lean, Alternate Names: Jonatan Aron Leandoer Håstad, Jonatan Aron Håstad, Jonatan A. L. Håstad, Jonatan Håstad, Leandoer, Yung Leandoer
Artist Description: Jonatan Aron Leandoer Håstad (born 18 July 1996), popularly known as Yung Lean, is a Swedish recording artist and the face of the Sad Boys.

Lean started out his success from the two songs “Oreomilkshake” and “Ginseng Strip 2002” from the Lavender EP. Both were highly viewed on YouTube and highly categorized as “meme rap” but actually being considered “cloud rap”. In 2013, Lean released the mixtape Unknown Death 2002. Around this time, he also put out other singles and collabs with Bladee, Thaiboy Digital, PradaMane, DJ Smokey, Denzel Curry and BONES. Later that year, he released his most popular single, “Kyoto”, which many thought would be featured on his debut album, Unknown Memory. As of 2021, it has racked up over 50 million views on YouTube. Lean then dropped his first debut album titled Unknown Memory, in which Lean replaced his sound with a more serious tone.

Lean also has some side projects: he releases music as Jonatan Leandoer96 (formerly Jonatan Leandoer127), a side project which showcases a more personal side, and as Metal Storm. He is also member of Punk band Död Mark, consisting of Lean himself and fellow Sad Boys member Gud.

Slither in with tricks, I'm sick
Acid trip makes my spitting sick

Fuck fat hoes like Adele
Get my dick stuck inside a lamp shell
Get it out with sperm cells and hair gel
Swim in Mexico, mademoiselle
Point and laugh while he fell
Who's laughing now, now that I'm explosive like Alfred Nobel
Yung Lean only attracts an older clientele
Very well (Bitch)

Title: Kyoto
Release Date: December 10, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Yung-lean-kyoto-lyrics
Song Description: It was assumed that the song would be the first single on Leans album Unknown Memory. However for unknown reasons, it did not make an appearance.

Kyoto marks a pivotal point of Yung Leans transition from totally intertwining his vocals into the production, into bringing his voice more centre stage.
Although this track still doesnt prominently feature his rapping as the main element, it does more so than his music released before it.

Back in 2013, Yung Lean transcribed the Kyoto lyrics in a post to the Sadboys Tumblr page. This is the way they appear on this page.

Producer Yung Gud did not use any samples for this beat, it is 100% Gud made.
Lyrics:

Do me, I'ma do me

See me swervin' through, they want me locked up

I'm Wario when I'm in Mario Kart
Topping the charts, Ace in my cards
Choppa my locka when I'm writing these bars
Koka Kola veins, I'm insane
Trip through memory lane
Out in Narashino and I see my own white shadows
A tad too close, rad with a bad diagnose
Coke-filled nose, too weird for them other fuckboys
Catch Lean and Sadboys out in Europe, sippin' Cristal
I'm smoking loud with my lost boys
All this money don't make me sad though
Rubber bands in my pants bro
Don't close your eyes and lean back though
Y'all ain't ready for the Lean attack though

Title: Yoshi City
Release Date: July 5, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Yung-lean-yoshi-city-lyrics
Song Description: Yoshi City was the lead single for Yung Leans 2014 project, titled Unknown Memory.

In contrast to many of his other songs, Leans voice and verse take stage, rather than often being intertwined (at times almost indistinguishably) with the production.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Tokyo city we're burned out
Yoshi city we burn it down
I guess it's my turn now
Smoking loud, I'm a lonely cloud
I'm a lonely cloud, with my windows down
I'm a lonely, lonely, I'm a lonely, lonely
Tokyo city we're burned out
Yoshi city we burn it down
I guess it's my turn now
Smoking loud, I'm a lonely cloud
I'm a lonely cloud, with my windows down
I'm a lonely, lonely, I'm a lonely, lonely

[Verse]
Be the only hope I got left
Blessed without success
Fuck stress, I'm gonna trust the best
I'm nervous that she's upset
She don't want me, bitch, I'm flustered
I'm an aristocrat without the progress
Roses all on her wedding dress
Blood from her mouth, I'm a mess
Alien faces everywhere I go
Downtown bitch that's where I smoke
Got my heart next to my phone
Do or die? Stupid high
Lonely nights, finna sacrifice
Fuck your life, I need mine
I'll take yours and rewind
Walk in my shoes, you'll see why
Fuck everyone, I don't reply
Sad boys bitch, we worldwide
Grey sweatshirt, L size
White Givenchy and grape Nikes
Fuck norms, fuck a normal life
Fuck norms, I'll break 'em out
A year and I'll blow that's what I said
Lean, lean, lean you got it in your head
Like a disease you know I spread
I can't sleep without you on my bed
Yoshi city, that's the town
All me, I came up now
Sad boys, time to burn it down
Windows down, face out

I'm the same guy smoking loud pack
Iced out, right back

Hoes on my ball sack

Broken skies, fantastic fox
Got keys, but I'll never find the lock

Skies pink when I'm on ecstasy
In Tokyo, playing Mario

Sucking on my nuts like pistachios
Mixing champagne with Carpaccio
Slangin' dough, hoe I'm in that polo
Stacks of money, more for you
Milkshakes with the crushed up oreos
I'm in Italy, Rodeo

Title: Agony
Release Date: November 10, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Yung-lean-agony-lyrics
Song Description: This song is written about when Lean arrived back to his Dads house in Sweden after being in a psychiatric unit. The piano is purposefully out of tune to mimic the mental state of Lean at the time.

Lean told NPR that Agony was his interpretation of Alice In Wonderland and Beauty And The Beast.

The last refrain is featuring a Icelandic childrens choir, recorded at the same time as the Stranger short film was recorded.

Agony is the most minimalistic song off the Stranger album: Lean is blunt and honest with his experience with psychosis and how this has affected his relationship.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Take a pill and go to sleep
I'm chasing witches in the street
I'm the last page in your book
Can't write a song, only do hooks
Watching horses in the fields
The dragon rests in agony
When I'm afraid, I lose my mind
It's fine, it happens all the time
When I'm afraid, I lose my mind
It's fine, it happens all the time

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
Isolation caved in
I adore you, the sound of your skin

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
So many lies that I found
Blood, Heaven, I stick to the ground
So many times I realized
What I seek for is right in front of my eyes
I'm alone in a hole in the ground
A theatre of dogs is still around
My furniture has come alive
I'm dancing with a candlestick tonight
Flying kites, raven outside my window
Smiles with fright

Title: Hennessy & Sailor Moon
Release Date: November 25, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Yung-lean-hennessy-and-sailor-moon-lyrics
Song Description: Hennessy & Sailor Moon is the standout lead single from Frost God, a project by Swedish rapper Yung Lean featuring fellow Drain Gang member Bladee. The track showcases a dynamic contrast between Leans emotive lyricism and Bladees detached persona, creating a compelling dual narrative.

Yung Lean is deeply infatuated with his Sailor Moon, dreaming of her constantly and expressing a desire to provide for her, focusing on his finances to grant her every want and need. Despite this devotion, theres an underlying vulnerability, as shes seen him through his darkest moments, leaving Lean unsure whether her love is genuine. He repeats you over 40 times, emphasizing his deep attachment and reflecting on their shared struggles. In lines like I can be your saviour, everything weve been through, he expresses a desire to protect and support her, reversing the roles in their relationship. This emotional openness contrasts sharply with Bladees detached attitude, who refers to himself as a young rockstar, signaling emotional distance. While Lean optimistically sings, We can go up to the stars, see clouds and fall through, imagining a future together, Bladee simply states, I went to the stars implying he has already experienced the highs and lows of infatuation and has moved past them, leaving Lean still navigating those emotions.

Months before its official release on November 25, 2016, Hennessy & Sailor Moon was teased on social media, with snippets and lyrics fueling fan anticipation.

Title: Miami Ultras
Release Date: February 25, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Yung-lean-miami-ultras-lyrics
Song Description: When Yung Lean wrote and recorded this song, it was in a dark time in his life when he was addicted to Xanax, lean and cocaineas outlined by his article with The Fader, which is a highly recommended read.

The song was recorded before Lean detached from reality and had a mental breakdown; destroying his condo. The police found him covered in blood from the debrishe was then checked into a mental hospital in Miami. Soon after, his friend Barron died after crashing his car while on Xanax.

The screamed delivery on the track represents his anger and frustration. His interview with The Fader explained the making of the track:

Perhaps as proof of his discomfort, the harsh, typhoon-sized beat for one of Warlords defining tracks, Miami Ultras, was composed not in the studio but on the pier beyond it. Sherman says there was a full moon on the night he made it, working on a laptop and headphones while his legs dangled over the water. During the night, it was very scary, he says. He and Lean, with his shouted delivery on the track, were influenced both by their location and by sounds from home, specifically a creepy track called The World Fell by a Danish synth-punk band named Vr. It has a really rough, beautiful vibe, Sherman says. A bit squeamish.

In the music video for Miami Ultras, (made after his recovery) Lean is in hospital clothes, covered in blood, with an I.V. in his arm; digging a grave. This represents how close he came to death at that point in his life. Lean started wearing hospital scrubs before his hospitalization and recovery:

By his own account, in Miami he was heavily addicted, not just to lean, but to Xanax, marijuana, and cocaine, and combining the drugs daily to troubling effect. Lean found himself slipping into characters that were hard to shake. He started dressing like a nurse, in hospital scrubs. He began to carry a knife. Most nights the drugs kept him up, so hed sit out on a balcony, writing a book in his iPhone called Heaven that retold childhood nightmares about people turning into ratsthe animal sign of his Chinese Zodiac.

I don't give a motherfuck
Watchin' Star Wars, smokin' pot
I take what I got, I live 'til it stops
Chop, chop, chop up my lungs, stay rot
I take what I got, you hate that you not
Like me, hate me, I don't give a motherfuck
What I am, what I'm not, Polo down to my socks

I'm not, looking for New

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
Stocktown, ghosttown, SBE

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
I'm smoking double pack, Louis duffel bag, get that money stack
Trouble's back, I don't give a fuck, we jump out the back
Where they at? Leave all my essentials in a zig-zag
Roll it up, take a drag
I'm the best at it, I don't like to brag
Leave my body in a bag
If you fuck around you in that body bag, burn the flag
Fuck who you know, I don't fuck with that
Couple zeros on a couple tags
Tunnel vision, tunnelin' a jag
Stumble out the hotel lobby
Shoveled gold knuckles, screaming, "Where they at?"
I won't be in your life again but you might see me in a mag'
Delete my number, never call me back
Flat on the ground, spat blood on my Acronym bag
We from Stocktown, seasons change
Bitch, you know where we at

Pull up with no lights, blowin' smoke, drinkin' ice

Title: Hoover
Release Date: November 11, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Yung-lean-hoover-lyrics
Song Description: Months after Hoover was performed live and a snippet of the track was posted to SBEs Tumblr, the official music video dropped November 11th, 2015.

Its largely different from much of Leans other songs, featuring harsh production in contrast to much of the ethereal soundscapes Lean often utilized in past songs.

In the music video, he is depicted riding on a dirt bike in the mud. When he released the merch for his following album, Stranger, he included two jerseys. They are in fact, motocross jerseys.

Hoover is the first single off Leans sophomore effort, Warlord.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Lean
Fattest bag around town, the law what I don't fuck with
Saddest frown around town, the dogs get to barkin', homie
Bag filled with white lies, sword in the drawer, homie
Leave my body in the night, wake up with some liquor on me
Wake up with some liquor in me
Wake up and the world is empty
Wake up and my bag is empty
Wake up, take a trip to Paris

[Verse]
Two dead rats, Hennessy, a gallon
Got a lotta shit in my bag like Santa
Bitches see me, hoes gettin' tantrum
Rockstar bitch, I'm like Marilyn Manson
Dirt on my face, bitches think I'm handsome
18, but my money likes expansion
Me and my boys was just out in Aspen
Actin' reckless, people call us madmen
I've always been this way and I call them has-beens
Never gave a fuck 'cause nothing ever mattered
Accept the actions, forget the sanction
Blowin' smoke in your face, became a dragon
Money in my right and my left hand
Ridin' on a horse with a dead man
Xans in my left hand

Title: Leanworld
Release Date: September 23, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Yung-lean-leanworld-lyrics
Song Description: Very sad song from Lean, and his take on a love song. He mentions an unnamed girl throughout the song, and it sounds like she has passed away, and talks about her, but ultimately sticks to his routine references to his squad, and riches. It features his traditional slow flows, slightly auto-tuned layered voice, and ambient flavored production.

In other words, its a love song, with Leans own uniqueness on top.
Lyrics:

[Hook]
The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly Kingdom with a lean girl
The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly Kingdom with a lean girl
I see her

[Verse 1]
I see her
At the back of the club with my boys blowing dub
We don't talk, don't show love
White shoes, white gloves
Dark night, end of
You got dro? Lots of
In the sky, like a dove
I wanna die and reach above
I never lie, as I seek of
The one who walked out of my life
I can’t get a hold of
SBE is who you speak of
I wanna be the one who you speak of
The one who you dream of
Lay me down, concrete love
Lay me down, concrete love

The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly Kingdom with a lean girl

Never felt threatened
We used to be peasants
Me and my boys blowin' up like nuclear weapons
Spray painted heaven
My shit together
The whole world infected
Only the fans get it
I see my reflection
Get my money, then I check in
You’re blessed by my presence
I just died and I checked in to heaven
To heaven

Title: Volt
Release Date: September 23, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Yung-lean-volt-lyrics
Song Description: For Volt, Lean adopts a faster flow than his usual slower, syllable emphasizing flow. The production itself also stands out as a bit different from his usual work, as it features a fast-paced and constant cymbal, rather than a track that has a space-like vibe to it.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Heart, heart, heart of a lion, lion
Heart departed from my soul
Thanks to everyone who hates me, only makes me fit my role
I got orange juice and doobies
I'll be tourin' troops and groupies
Shed fire, vampire, diamonds, diamonds, I got rubies
I got pills in my smoothies
SBE, just some loonies
Move like gang, hit the scene with my trueies
Money, money in my bank account
You know I've gotta spend it all
Flick the lighter's light
If I die you'll never see me fall
Fuck the police, till the, till the, till the curtain call
Ball? No, basketball, New shoes, bank calls
Mix it with some alcohol, Adderalls, till I fall
Not supposed to make it so we chase it till we got 'em all
Made it, did it, out of zero
Flipped it, got it, made a hero
Fuck the game, I've been a year old

Keep a chainsaw and a stack in my storage
(Ayy, hang with me, I make a fortune)
(My style ain't got no father like an orphan)
Got your eyes and your smile, but I don't feel like you
See the buildings, they fallin', it's all for her
Pledge allegiance to myself, I know what to do
Pledge allegiance to what we started, it's all I do
She stand nude in the hallway
High heels and sip Bombay
So much drama like broadway
Against the world
Fuck what they all say
Made of steel but my heart breaks
I will take care of her (Lean)

Song Description: Friday the 13th is the second track off of Yung Leans project Poison Ivy and features production from Leandoers frequent collaborator Whitearmor.

The song is named after Friday the 13th, an American horror film franchise that focuses on the fictional mass murderer Jason Voorhees. Leandoer has drawn influence from the horror franchise before, even wearing a Jason mask on Instagram.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Take it all the way, ayy

[Verse 1]
Friday the 13th, you with the maniacs
We the wave makers, this is Navy rap
We both fucked up, I had to take you back
I ain't really sleeping, I take baby naps
Won't make it home, won't make it back
Crib filled with blow, we brought the '80s back
R.I.P. Barron, for you we blow a sack
Can't leave my boys, yeah, I got your back
Lean need a birch, shawty bringing stacks
Haunted house, yeah we on a different path

[Chorus]
Ice on froze, head on freeze
Still sippin' on fours, lemonade and speed
Baseball bat at award ceremonies
New rings on, no new destiny
Money on deck, make the bank call me
Chandelier ice castle, on E
Ice on froze, but my head on freeze
Still sippin' on fours, lemonade and speed

[Verse 2]
Dark knight, angels dirty when I need a plan
I pop, with them birdies, been fly like that
2040, me and gang, Gotham City land
(Wanna find the time, be with you and just hold your hand)
Leandoer AKA the crow, flying rats and sand
When I try to be carefree I just end up sad
21, almost 22, missions on the map
Light blue jewelry, 3-6 wrist tan
360 worldwide, put Stockholm on the map
Sometimes nightmares don't just end like that
Love will find us in the end, but I don't really see that
Love will find us in the end, but I don't really need that

Draped in that Gucci scarf, my phone going berserk
I don't do no eye contact, my vision blurred-blurred (Blurred-blurred)
I'm a demon like a Furfur, they think I'm absurd-surd
But when I enter the galaxy, they all laugh, like word-word
"I'm too fucked up," she said when I heard her
I don't have no feelings left, I don't wanna hurt her
I am surfing on the Earth, I'm a surfer
Look into the sky and I see myself
I don't wanna fall down, I don't need your help
I just popped a pill, I can't control myself
I'm in that forest and my life is like a fairy tale
D— Diamonds in my veins, I'm sipping ginger ale
Hate in my heart getting guided by elves
I'm a lion in this shit, everyone else a snail (Snail, snail)
Smoke still coming out my mouth when I exhale (Yeah)
Look into the sky and I see myself
I don't wanna fall down, I don't need your help
Shout out to my enemies, I wish you well (I wish you well)
Shout out to my enemies, I wish you well (I wish you well)

Swear on my mother's life, I ain't gon' die tonight
But I will get high, and ride tonight

The title is likely an allusion to the film Oceans Eleven, which, coincidentally, was released in 2001.
Lyrics:

Creeping in the cut, with a Tommy gun
I'ma stomp on your fondue

Count racks, cash checks, and all that
Bad breath, LSD right, creeping 'round like a lab rat
Eat her out, kit kat

Title: Yellowman
Release Date: November 10, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Yung-lean-yellowman-lyrics
Song Description: Yellowman is the final track on Yung Leans 3rd official studio album Stranger

The track is a direct reference to a series of short stories called The King in Yellow by Robert W Chambers, published in 1895. The books are macabre in tone and tied together by a fictional play called The King in Yellow which instils madness in those who read it.



Carcosa is referenced in the first verse and is the fictional setting of The King in Yellow. Carcosa is described as a mysterious, ancient, and possibly cursed place.

These themes of madness and otherworldly-ness tie into Yellowman and more broadly, Stranger as a whole, especially in the context of Yung Leans relationship with his public image and his struggles with mental health.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Sadboys

[Verse 1]
Walk away, I'll fade to grey, but not today
As long as you are here, I'll be okay
Now, I wanna walk, wanna walk today
If my life not in grey I'll walk today
I'll, I'll be your yellowman, Carcosa land
I'll be your spaceman, your walking hand
But not today, want to fade away
But I keep going (going everyday)

[Verse 2]
See me movin' out of foreigns slow
She just wanna spend my dough
Movin' out of dungeons slow
Watch just how I shine and glow
Louis Vuitton on me, ho
Draped up in silk all my robe
Shadows with me where I go
Bag over my face - freakshow
Fuck with me, I'll bring you down
Whole crowd, they don't make a sound
Watch the ravens fly around
I don't care about your sound
You could try and talk to me
Visions are reality
We are slow, but we are clowns
Poppin' downers, no more crowns

Release Date: May 15, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Yung-lean-yayo-lyrics
Song Description: On Yayo, Yung Lean talks about his rise in the music industry to the prominent spot that he is at. The title of the song calls back to Leans addiction to cocaine (yayo) in 2015.

The track was recorded and first previewed by Lean with Playboi Carti on January 25, 2020. This was also later confirmed by the recording date in the filename of the leak, which also mentioned that Cartis verse was recorded at Means Street Studios. It was previewed in full quality in the teaser video for Starz released on March 27, 2020. Lean previewed another snippet with possible visuals for the track on May 1, 2020, with a post on Instagram.

When the snippet was played for the music recognition software Shazam, it revealed the artist as Yung Lean Feat. Playboi Carti. On April 29, 2020, Cartis name was removed from Shazam and the tracklist was released without a mention of Carti. The version with Carti was leaked on May 4, 2020. On May 15, the song was released without the feature, and with a second verse from Lean instead. According to Lean on Instagram, it was Cartis label that forced the removal of the verse.

The version with the Playboi Carti feature would eventually be included in the vinyl release of Starz on August 14, 2020.

Song Description: In Part 1, bender, Lean is suffering from paranoia, hallucinations and not knowing if he can trust his own mind. He seems to be feeling restless and haunted, until the song transitions to its secondary phase.

In Part 2, girlfriend, even though hell, mayhem and restlessness are portrayed throughout the project, Poison Ivy ends on a relatively happy note  showing Lean  feeling at peace because he has found someone who he believes is worth any suffering.
Lyrics:

Reaching for the stacks, long arms man, Slender
Riding round town, blowing dough, money spender
We all get lost sometimes, but I surrender
Trying to spend the night with you, mark my calendar
Leandoer's still Polo'd down like a settler
Freezing moon, started mayhem, nothing's matter

[Chorus]
Gotta check the price
Rubies on my ice
Green gate, cold gate, haunted all my life
Something ain't right
I smell that in the night
Weird phone calls, do you still fantasize?
Had to check the price
Rubies on my ice
Green gate, Colgate, haunted all my life
Something ain't right
I smell that in the night
Weird phone calls, do you still fantasize?

I'm abnormal, Gargamel, cruisin' in the four door
We rollin' deep, Swisher Sweets to my portal
Nine cat lives, got nine silver knives
I got big red eyes and I'm feelin' so immortal

[Verse]
Welcome to my corridor
Feelin' like a warlord
Exoskeleton, I became a martyr
Mexico by night if you wanna take a charter
Grind a little harder
Snow White, seven dwarves, chains on baller
Ten black bottles with my boys overseas
Cadillacs like melted cheese
Money in my time machine
Went to China, set me free
Silver screens on silver screens
Chandeliers, I make believe
I just do as I please
Sippin' lean as I sleep
Countin' money like it's sheep
Badass bitch on the side of me
She go, 'cause she know
It's all that I need
'Cause she know, 'cause she go
Palm trees look like seeds
Feelin' so immortal (Lean)
Feelin' like a Warlord
My breeze
My chain, my watch, make you freeze

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
For my set, I go in

Ice blood on my face, I'm forever thrown
SBE, we some vampires, Dracula
I'm in an Acura, four, five figures, stack 'em up
I'm not good with calculus, I need a calculator
Glass elevator, shoes made by alligators
I'm flying in the sky, feel the air
I'm heartless, fire flying everywhere
Let the darkness take my heart, I put my heart on my sleeve
I'm stuck forever, I could never leave

Where did I go? You'll never know
Lookin' for me, but I'm buried under snow

Lyrics:

[Chorus]
I got electricity running through my veins
I got everything, who am I to blame?
Stock like the flowers in the rain
Smoking this dope, I think I'm going insane
Moving through the city, with my keys in the snow
Time running through my hands
I have to let it go, have to let it go
In the shadows of the city in my mind
Nothing matters anymore, it's just a matter of time
'Til we fall back and meet again
Feed my needs again
Posted with my friends
I resurrect to rise again

[Verse]
They call me crazy, at least they talking straight
Shock first so they listen now, that’s my faith
Cop a real estate out in winterland, made it out
Bless my fate
Just be you, it's never too late
All I do is great
Sprinkle the hash
Let me live fast
Show up last with the biggest bands
Least love but the biggest fans
I'm a weirdo, so to the weirdos I give back
Roses in my bathtub, leave your, leave your blood in a black mug
Used to be a hobby now it's all I think about
That's what rap does

Wannabe, they all look like some wannabes
I'ma leave, every leaf that grows after me
Come and see, bitch, we deep, human centipede
On my feet, there's no e's, see no enemies
Kilo green, speak my heart till I rest in peace
All I see, road warriors, eternal sleep

Gotta go hard for myself, I look after me
20 e's, double g, never fall asleep
Eyes on sight, ancient whispers they still follow me

Narnia gave me wisdom
Keys to my mind, angels on my rhythm

Diamond in the wind

I’m not sorry for my sins
Been here forever, where you been?
Got that orange juice and Gin
Throw my conscious in a bin
Blowing smoke, neo rings
Dead, dead soul within
Dreaming thick, not thin
Thanks to the city where I’m in
I’m in the sea, but I can’t swim
Used to be nothing now I win
Left my soul to swim, left my, left my soul to swim

[Intro]
Spiders on my feet but you be caught up in the web
X-Files

[Chorus]
I be draped in Bur-Burberry
Late nights like the cemetery
Walking dead, look like F-Freddy
Cherry color painted Chevy
Draped in blood now, super scary
Got magic like I'm Ha-Harry
Dark magician, you a fairy
Hummer yellow, birds like Larry

[Verse 1]
I go too far like Jim-Jim Carrey
Killed them, it was necessary
I don't wanna get too heavy
Have her one night, bet you wanna marry
I'm off some shrooms in a place where you cannot be
Three jellyfish in a dungeon where reptiles be
I feel your love and I see it inside of me
Value your friendship, we drink 'til it's over, see

Red lava, red fish, red tablets, all growing free
You imbeciles try to be, but you cannot be
My money was small, but I made it grow rapidly, rapidly

[Verse 2]
I made 600K, bet that's play money, we set
I got scars, no tissue, all my songs they hot like red
Save all your luxuries, bitch, I just need a check
Fuck with me again, I'll make them insects eat your head, ayy
Diamonds dance like Happy Feet, but happy ain't my set
Sadboys steal your shit, then we hop-hop up on a jet

Nice, no distance
Nights, night vision
Life - existence
Nice-

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Night vision in my armour
Yeah, I took it over
Watching Space Jam
Lean's never sober
Stunting with my team, is your baby's mama dream
I'm so icy, I'm so clean, Sad Boys, and Yung Lean
Drive a body down in my Range Rover
Trying to calm it down like I'm Oprah
Police knocking on my window
But it's like I told ya
Soon as they approach us
Squash 'em like cock roaches

[Hook: Bladee]
Nice, no distance
Nights, night vision
Life - existence
Nice existence

Sad Boys season
I'm in space for a reason
Coke on my clothes
Counting stacks up in Sweden
My trees spent, let me, let me get me some
Three headed dolphin
It's the threesome
Lean, lean and Hennessy and Sprite
With the cheese and the MAC
To your back
Make you believe in religion
Found upon gods in the season
Sad Boys season
Digimon, plane crashes
Smoke hash 'til the ashes
Vietnam flashes
Ecstasy in the glass
Iced out patches on my scars, but it's rashes
Digimon plane crashes
Smoke hash 'til the ashes
Vietnam flashes

[Hook: Bladee]
Nice, no distance
Nights, night vision
Life - existence
Nice existence

Title: Ice Cold Smoke
Release Date: September 23, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Yung-lean-ice-cold-smoke-lyrics
Song Description: Lean played and debuted this song at his American show at the VFILES.

At first many thought the song was called Eternal life but then when the album and songs were released it was obvious that it was Icecoldsmoke.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Eternal life
Make my city proud
Fuck everyone, king without a crown
Lean up in the whip, yeah turn it up
Just got a check, might burn it up
Lost at life, I don't boost up
All this time flies away in my coffee cup
I-l-I like being alone, shut the fuck up
Sad Alliance ballin' out in Europe
I got Gucci, Louis, A.P.C. gear on
Live in winterland, but I'm iced up

[Chorus]
See me blowing ice cold smoke, finna' roll up
See me blowing ice cold smoke, finna' roll up
See me flying high, I got no love
Pull up to the spot with my Range Rover
See me flying high, I got no love
Pull up to the spot with my Rover

[Outro]
Eternal life
Make my city proud
Fuck everyone, king without a crown
Lean up in the whip, yeah turn it up

Sandman CEO
SBE, cash man
Damn man, shawty got it bad with her last man
Fat pants, big diamonds, sipping jasmine
Roll up to the mountain and I'm draped in all black, man
True friends, only roll with true friends
Green tea, straight out the tin can
Think man, reminisce on what has
Has been, hash man
Throw my conscience in the trash can
Trash man, that is what they said I'd be
It's been a good year
It's time to raise the glass man
Cops man, fuck the police, let 'em blast them
Fatten, all my money fattens
What the hell happened?
Fishscale salmon
Hop on the bandwagon

[Verse]
All I do is golden
Work more than Saffron
Plasma's, all my TV's plasma's
Patterns, you can see the patterns in my passion
Only roll companions
Wonderland, I'm in Wonderland like I'm Alice
My palace, is going too fast, let me fasten seat belt
Louis V, can you imagine?
MDMA, no Montana

Bitch I'm in the clouds, you can see me broad day
If you call me up I might get in where you stay
St-st-stone island, iced out, ain't no tellin' where I stay
If-if I'm gone tomorrow, let them know it's okay
G-G-Gucci on my pants, I got roses on my grave
T-t-too many voices, I can't hear what they say
It's just me, my team blowin' dreams
Driftin' themes, ain't no scheme
I k-k-k-keep my boys around, cause I don't want to talk to peeps
See I don't wanna pay for shit and I don't wanna die
Lean gets all his shit for free, cause I gotta survive
I don't wanna pay for shit and I don't wanna die
L-L-Lean gets all his shit for free, cause I gotta survive

[Verse]
E-E-Eurostars around my car, slap the stupid up
Love my squad we all stars, up on Jupiter
Made it far, crossed the bar, make em' stupid rich
I'm like Bart throwing darts, out a spooky bus
You think you go in, but Lean goin' stupider
Imma make 'em loop it up, pax go round like nucleus
See, I don't wanna pay for shit and I don't wanna die
Lean get's all his shit for free cause I gotta survive, bitch
Eurostars around my car, slap the stupid up
Love my squad, we all stars, up on Jupiter
Made it far, crossed the bar, make em' stupid rich
I'm like Bart throwing darts, out a spooky bus
You think you go in, but Lean goin' stupider
Imma make 'em loop it up, pax go round like nucleus
Candy, everything I see it's painted candy
Lean up in these sheets where I sleep, sippin' brandy
Ban me, all these broke hoes can't stand me
I'm flyin' through outer space, these drugs can't land me
Ban me, get your money up if you're tryna get me (ca$h, ca$h)
All they do is hate, cause they can't understand me
I be bumpin' Smiths in a mansion, you can't be
But you could try to be me
All I see is feelings, but they don't understand me
My family, I got love for them and my fans see
Bitch I'm, bitch I'm, bitch I'm tryna get it like everyday

Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Liquid knives, check the prize, live like no tomorrow

Suffer, suffer, but I glo
(Yeah, I can't even ride the train no more, man)
Head down in the metro

[Verse]
Sharpen knives to the sky, it's a place of sorrow
On the top of the tower with my bow and arrow
Liquid lies, lost my fright when I saw the rainbow
Lotta ice, lotta ice when we in the castle
Where I go, where I look, they all tend to follow
I see shadows in my dreams, they put me in chokeholds
Want my style , go and steal it, and they called it borrowed
Put the money in motion, I ain't got no morals
Put the money in motion, I pull strings, Geppetto, ayy
Ain't nobody know me, but my name so known
Everybody around me high, but I stay low
(Everybody around me high, but I stay low)
Everybody around me gone, check the condo
Everybody around me evil, they got halos
Hole in my head and my heart so froze
Everybody around me fly, fly like sparrows
Whatever I want, gotta get it pronto
Nine lives like a cat, jumpin' out the window
We make magic, burn cash, you know that's our motto
Whole lotta digits when they scan the barcode, ayy, ayy

Euros, hundreds, hundreds, ice, diamonds, sipping Coke though
Sixties, fifties, spend them so I can't see no evil spirits

I don't want to hurt you
Movin' 'round in circles
Will do if I have to
All I do is work you
I got Gs on Gs like burgers
Movin' 'round like lurkers
I lost all my urges
Pink polo painted circus
Insert money and surf through
Life is like a drive-thru
I guess I could die soon
I feel like a typhoon
Smell like weed and perfume
Smurf-blue pills like squirrels
All I smoke is herbal
Pradas, them be purple
Mailbox clean, Donald Duck lungs
I need a million dollars, not some bucks, son (Fuck your money at?)
Duck one, duck two painted trucks, son
When we roll up, Gucci mats on my truck, son (Truck, truck)
Where I come from, pop anthrax
Air Max, we got ten stacks
I be smokin' tear gas
Percocet, that's a fear fac'
Yeah, I got my gear back
Don't hold tears from years back

Fuck what you heard the city’s mine
The city’s mine, I’ll put it down
I’ll put it down for everyone around me
You could try and look for me
But you could never find me
Get behind me

I got spirit flowers wasting money every hour
You don’t like me, you a liar
I’m a-I’m a sacrificer
Get my palace like I’m Alice
Floating floating floating empire
All I do is get higher, never tired
You can’t touch me, cause I’m made of wire

Song Description: Princess Daisy is the seventh track off Yung Leans album Unknown Death 2002.

The track takes the shape of a slow, classic hip-hop sounding beat, with screwed down, almost spoken-sounding vocals from Lean over the top.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Smoking on some sour in Bahamas
Wearing green Polo pajamas, made of marijuana
Fuck an ugly hoe, like Johnny Drama
Licking off, dripping champagne from my fingernail
Tripping off ginger ale
This tune ain't got no hook
Like a monkey tail
Me and Pedro on this bitch
Wearing aventail
On the beach, with the pink polo
The color of rose, dirty stinking feet
Started drinking whiskey neat
Birdie shrinkin' tree
Yung Lean, it's that curly-haired freak
Take a seat
Got a new passport
Eating lobster in court
Teleport to a new timezone with an escort
Got a fort filled with hoes that just want to snort
Take that boat to my resort
In Hawaii, where I got a tennis court
I forgot to mention that I still get child support

[Verse 2]
Drinking 40s out in Honolulu
With my shawty and she's siftin' on chicken pu-pu
I'm in doo-doo
Hoes sucking nuts but this ain't no Chip and Dales
Drifting fails, off a drifting tale
Made of minimum wage
Starring in shit movies like Nicolas Cage
I'm drinking a piña colada in the plage
Inhale, exhale, fuck a female

Wrist diamonds ice
Percocet my Sprite (My Sprite)
Perkys in my Sprite (My Sprite)
Louis bag, three stripes
As I walk through the fire with my wings
I could only stop for this iron like a lane
She just want to pop all the molly in the Benz
I've been gettin' rich, makin' money with my friends
Bitch, we off them shits, time to stay until the end
I'm just tryna pop all the bottles, fuck the feds
I got fifty pills all up in Armani bags
She gon' watch how I spend it like just to get it back
Sittin' on the field, snakes through the money tracks
Breakin' in and enterin', bitch, we poppin' tags
Keep the fire burnin' off a blunt like candle wax
Burnin' down your money 'til it ain't nothin' to stack

Wh-wh-when we off them rocks, I'ma tell you everything
Soap on my shoes and on my heart, it's getting thin
But you're a butterfly ridin' through the desert winds
I'm a raven bird, I love all the finer things
When I come close, close to you I can't sin
Heaven knows I'm bad, but Lord, I can't fix a thing
Fly too close to the sun, my wings give in (Give in)
I gave you my whole life, don't owe you a thing
As I chose life and this rug made of mink
Burnin' down the winter 'cause I'm over everything

Coke up in the swisher
Switching lanes like switching bitches

Turn into the neatest riches
Hand around the shoulder, I see neon kisses
I'm balling, balling, dunk and throw
'Til my hand starts twitching, twitching
Y'all think I'm so weird
I ain't really human, I'm really weird
Couldn't give less fucks 'bout my career
Posted in a spaceship, showing no fear
No one heard about Lean a month ago, ago
I was in my bedroom making music, yo
I make no sense, make nonsense
Should've played in the face of the window from my Benz
Stunting all you haters, I jumped over the fence
Jumped over the chase, jumped up on top of her
With my AK-47 in the face
Take you back to heaven, it's a race
Counting stacks, smoking daze
Bey Bey-blades to count up my pace

Song Description: A single released by Lean a short time after his mixtape, Unknown Memory 2002
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Flexing, flexing, Lean, flexing like a rubber band
I be ballin', I be ballin', all this money in my hand
Alcohol in everything, Sad Boys at the top, man
G-T-B-S-B, Sad Boys leave your body with the others man
Leave 'em in the Netherland, Polo, Polo robes
See me, see me in that Rolls Royce
I've been counting all this money with my team, Sad Boys Worldwide Entertainment
We go harder, name any lame rapper, Lean, I'm much smarter
See me flying out, you living large, I'm living larger
I love this life, this ain't no departure
Sweden's cold, but I'm hotter
I've been out there working, I'ma, I'ma work harder
North Face bucket hat, hunna, hunnas in my armor
So many plants, Lean, Lean could be a gardener
They wish death upon me and my partners
I've been, I've been, I've been working, I'ma work harder
Rose on plants, make me train sharper
17 year olds, I'm getting farther
Getting farther, 'cause it's me and Kreayshawn
Yung Lean, bitch, I run the game
Tie you up and let the words run through your brain

[Verse 2: Kreayshawn]
Kreayshawn, Kreayshawn
When you coming back? Man, you must've fell off
I was never on
Tell my friends who think I'm famous, no, they're wrong
I'm feeling sad, the label left me 'cause I'm a mom
Now I've got a future, but I'm still looking for where I belong
I cry my ass off every night, but it's all inside
I hold my fist up and I shake it to them cloudy skies
Why me? Why me? Why am I so fly?
All this pressure to be cool makes me a sad guy (Sad guy, sad guy)

See me up on everything

I don't need no education, just a basement and some bud
Louis duffle bags, duffle, duffle bags in my trunk
See me in the fucking club, at the back, blowing doves
Sad Boys is my team and no, you cannot join
Flipping my chances of life and death, like flipping the coin, ripping your groin
Kicking these songs, emotional boys for life
[?], sus the phones, telephone, Gatorade in the styrofoam
Demons inside me, that is so wrong
Ghost on my life, wish I could take the time back
Wake up and she's gone, with filthy chains, ice in my veins
I'm Miyazaki when it rains, woke up and felt no pain
I'm happy with my friends, just wanna remain the same
Catch me sipping champagne, too futuristic for all you lames
Inhumane, think I give a fuck what other people say?
Got my team with me, you should, you should turn the other way
Don't talk to me 'cause you know I don't talk much
Rolling up a Dutch, I [?] don't touch
When the moon shines, I don't close my eyes12Embed

I don't feel no pain
I don't care cause I don't feel no pain
I don't really care
I don't feel no pain
I don't care cause I don't feel no pain

[Verse: Yung Lean]
Hate, love, driving foreign
Drop top, rockin' Ralph Lauren
Had to upgrade, we love soup pourin'
Milk and cereal like every mornin'
No lies in my mouth, I don't speak corny
Stockholm ridin' for lean, don't we?
Tell your friends that I'm dead, homie
No soul, no life, just blood on me
Keep my boys around, all you others bore me
Don't talk to no one, don't steal my glory
Fuck, fuck my glory, the whole world ignores me
And I'm stuck in my room till that snorts it
G-shock, G-shock round my wrist, wearing Gucci boots
Looking at myself like "why you wearin' that stupid human suit?"
I relive for recruit, I survive and I shoot
Magic powers, I use, you hate me, I assume
D-D-Don't give a fucks about you, being myself's kind of cool
Alien Face on the news, Lean's always on the move
I-I can't handle no booze, livin' my dreams, I need you
If you talk that's on you, I brought Sweden back on the moon, on the moon, on the moon, on the moon

Title: Blue Plastic
Release Date: November 7, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Yung-lean-blue-plastic-lyrics
Song Description: Lean sings about a one sided relationship and about how he exposed himself to someone, but ended up being a bad choice. Just wanting to bottle those feelings up but those bottled up feelings always end up exploding him to fragments. In the outro Lean might be saying fragance instead of fragments as a refrence to the book perfume, where the antagonist dies because of a smell/fragrance that makes people commit cannibalism. This makes sense considering the ending in the MV. Lean might be saying that people want to consume and overcome him from the smell/sound he portrays.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Sew me up, I can be your doll
Stuff me with cotton and take it all
Make me whole, make me walk on Mars
Back in your bedroom, like every fall
Nothing to do here, been gone so long
Nothing to do here, been here so long
Everyone's got ideas, but they're all wrong
Nobody wants to get it, but they're all for talk
Nobody gives a fuck, I'm not the one to talk
Nobody gives a fuck, I'm not the one to talk

[Chorus]
Baby blue plastic, wrap me around
Exploding like fragments onto the ground
Wanna be like magic, burning, not found
I exposed myself, I'm done, I'm down
I'm done, I'm down
Fuck it, I'm done, I'm down

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Baby blue plastic, wrap me around
Exploding like fragments onto the ground

Fuck 'em, I don't care
Don't wanna be near you or breathe your air (Air)
I'll see you there
You got no loyalty, so I leave you there (Left all of my sanity)
Right where you stand
Never thought that was part of the plan
Get you out of my head, get you out of my head
Get you out of my head, get you out of my head (My head)

You don't need your friends
You don't need yourself, I don't need no wealth

Nitrous oxi-xide, I've seen the world collide
I lost count of all the times she asked me why
M-m-magic in her eyes, Leandoer's paradise
All my, all my boys off drugs, I've been lost in this life
Fire flames, color red, memories of time
Stacks of shoes, got so many, don't really know the 'mount
When it's hot outside, I cop me some ice
Travel in disguise, I see trouble in her eyes
Mix it with Fanta, not with Sprite, wings from Calvin Klein

Lyrics:

[Intro]
I see you, see you
See you
(X stacks, x, killer, killer, killer)

[Chorus]
Killer instincts, stacks up, silicon wings
Insect skin, red blood on my Timbs
Inject sins, all my boys, they gon' win
Evil magic in my veins, wearing thin
I count two hundred stacks before my day begins
Purple kush and purple hearts, live in a world like Sims
I'm on a pill, I need more bars, got knives on my rims
Crushing K on Visa cards, see you on everything

[Verse]
Psycho instincts, red dove, blood wings
I might fuck up, I'm not in my memory, it's going thin
Into to the mist, into the void, I'm a sith
Darth Maul gadgets in the cloak, don't let them in
I grew up way too fast before my life took turns
I still suffer, burden, and at cross roads, I don't turn
I'm in a sanctuary, Saint Mary, I can't learn
Months of isolation, I forgot that I could hurt
Throw your loud up, clouds up, got my heart with me
Throw your crowns up, ice up, keep it smart with me
She blew a car up, nice drug, keep it dark with Lean
Finna find the light inside, that is dark in me
Meet the crowd, fuck towns up, dogs bark with me
Blow your heart up, Simpson Bart, from the start with me
Think she's proud of ya, she found out why she stuck with me
In the laundromat, red blood from the sharks with me

So many engines, like my diamonds need a serviette

I feel sick into the ceiling, hurt to see my life

[Verse 1]
Woodgrain drippin', finger lickin', polo'd down
Cider sippin', slide the coupe and switch it out
Stockholm city, dungeon with me
We doin' dirt, blowin' smoke
Countin' bands on the low
Smokin earth 'round the globe
With the team from the snow
Doin' dirt, blowin' smoke
Countin' bands on the low
Smokin' earth 'round the globe

Draped in fur like a bird

Kamen Rider came in with the right hand, we come through
Sad Boys, we don't need you
We bleed tears, we don't see you
We're a velociraptor, we don't feed fools
We eat you, like seafood
Sushi and that  tofu, Sprite and wine for my whole crew

[Hook]
Shawty, you with Lean
Shawty, you wanna come with me?
Shawty-shawty, you with Lean
Shawty, you wanna come with me?

Lyrics:

[Chorus]
I'm the angel of darkness
I leave you dead and unconscious
I hide myself, I'm regardless
If you say friends in my pocket
I'm smoking loud like a rocket
I said fuck all these other artists
I wake up and I start shit
I'm by myself in this starship
All you other rappers are garbage
Leandoer flow so retarded
My soul is a hostage
This is a preview of everything

[Verse]
I turn nothing to everything
I time travel, I’m aging again
I’m aiming at lightning
I'm here when it's frightening
I turn the clouds into lightning
I guess I'm not good at lying
I said blaze in the shades when I’m writing
Everything you want is what I’m buying
Fuck your style, you're biting
Hurt but now I’m rising
I’m shining, I’m shining
Lean comes in perfect with the timing
I'm in the forest, I'm hiking
With my boys, drunk driving
Cold heart I'm a Viking
I said fuck rapping, I'm retiring
I didn't ask for calls, fuck replying
No new friends, fuck socialising

Switchblade in my hand make you fall back
Flat on the ground make you fall flat
Rainbow dreamland take you far back
I'm up in the mountains with the stars man
I'm in the jungle flying round' like Tarzan
Xanax on, sent too many bars man
I'm gone been gone from the start man
Road warrior I do car jack
Suicide doors on my whip, what do you call that?
It's too late for me to crawl back
Still late she hasn't called back
I'm in the night wearing all black
Nightmare road flashbacks from all that
Won't let me in, fuck the guards man
Run around the world like a quarterback
I'm too busy got to much on my almanac
Feeling like a baller got a tall stack
Remember back when I dreamed about all that
White shadows, white smoke, white walls man
In a hospital got here in a taxi cab
Been fucked too long, fuck rehab
Pick up a tab and get it while I still laugh
Got an evil twin he's my better half
Addicted to green like a giraffe

Title: Victorious
Release Date: August 25, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Yung-lean-victorious-lyrics
Song Description: Yung Lean and Bladee reminisce about how far theyve come through the years. The beginning of the fourth verse was previewed by Yung Lean on an Instagram story, days before the release of the song.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Bladee]
I was dirty in designer before it was trendy
I was tryna stay awake, my eyes are heavy
I was sorry before I was even born, so just forgive me
By the way, you're way too pretty to be petty
I was praying for the sword to be reborn, you didn't send me
But I feel like it is finally descending
When we raise our glasses up, its overflow is never empty
We're victorious and happy in the ending

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
It was already inside me, I didn't have to look
With you, I fight fair, it's the story, it's the book
I-I know the feeling, but I'm losing spirit
What goes around comes around, it's deep from the beginning
Two heavy swords lay heavy at the wake
Pray for your arrival, never pray for your mistakes
Wedding bells and ancient spells, I'll meet you at the gate
You can see it in my face, blood rain (Let the rain hit the waves)

[Verse 3: Bladee]
At the edge of the blade, that's the point
Shooting for the stars, but we aim for the gold
Swimming with the sharks to the gods 'cause the spoils
I know in my heart that it's all very void
Staying very warm, could be flames on the foil
Now we wash our face and then spray essential oils
Destiny is ours, yet they hate on the boys
You can either go hard or not, it's a choice

Now we fly from islands like it's 2001
Helicopters on the roof, I make this shit look fun
We was dirty in designer when the finer things would come
And we took so many risks, now you see the outcome
I fell off, but I came back on top
Lay low with the rose gold wrapped around the watch
Got bloodshot eyes, I've been working 'round the clock
SUVs by the gate, real estate, got the world in our palms

[Verse 5: Bladee]
Do you know what? Just stop 'cause you're not
Darkness in my head, it gets it spinning like a clock
In this crystal palace and I dare you throw a rock
We got so much different kind of flavors, come and shop
Blowing all this money 'cause it's windy at the top
You can cut it out or cut it off and watch it rot
Do you wanna be with the team or not?

We the type of boys to change the game and go broke

Life is a playground, play with my grey sounds
Take me and eat mine, let it shine

Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Lately, I've been makin' money, magic
But I'm caught up in the traffic
Killin' verses, that's a habit
Yeah, I'm always stackin', laser tracking
Always down to make it happen, wrapped in plastic
(Wrap it, wrap it up)
Remember back, back, addicts in the attic
I was working, Mickey D's, kinda trashy (yeah, I was working)
September feelings, but we lavish on the plane
Go to Paris, mass massacre, attacking

[Verse]
Yeah, I'm still flashy, knives of madness
I'm a bore, bank is slacky, get slackin'
Call me Alice, I've been poppin' a white rabbit
We gon' make it rain cabbage in the palace
Since a toddler, I've been swaggin'
Since a toddler, I've been having
I'm your uncle, not your daddy
Call me Alice, I've been poppin' a white rabbit
We gon' make it rain cabbage in the castle

Lately, I've been makin' money, magic

Lyrics:

[Chorus]
I'm blowin' money, fallin' from the sky, think I'm Bruce Willis
Cocaine the king, it's super wild, I think I'm too pretty
Money stuck under my mattress, think that I'm the tooth fairy
Flying around the clouds, I think I'm Ganondorf, I'm too scary
I'm blowin' money, fallin' from the sky, think I'm Bruce Willis
Cocaine the king, it's super wild, I think I'm too pretty
Money stuck under my mattress, think that I'm the tooth fairy
Flying around the clouds, I think I'm Ganondorf, I'm too scary

[Verse]
I'm supercharged, money extra large
Posted up, flyin' up in that Mario Kart
I get it fast, poppin' Ecstasy when I'm up on Mars
Extra fast, like Sonic when I'm off the bars
All you know is alcohol and white lines
All I'm on is Adderall and bright lights
Walking through the gates of hell, I'm iced out
I hear angels whisper that it's night time
I feel like a city with no people in it
Ghost city, I can't breathe up in there
When I'm with you, I don't feel so empty
Got a silver steel knife made by Fendi
I don't wanna live anymore, don't wanna be twenty
LSD dreams, thank God, can't comprehend

[Intro]
Holy
Man, oh man, you should see all the kinds of friends we've got over here at Foster's

[Chorus]
Crash Bandicoot, bands my hands
Trash sandy road, skrrt the land
Crash Bandicoot, bands my hands
Trash sandy road, skrrt the land
Crash Bandicoot, bands my hands
Trash sandy road, skrrt the land

Trash sandy road, skrrt the land

[Verse 1]
Black antidote, I'm on ten
I'm in the parking lot, where's my man?
I'm off a Xan', off a juice, off a bean
Trapped in our ways, ain't nobody live free
Like Sherlock Holmes, I sneak up on ya easy
I don't like trouble, but it sure likes me
In a French garden on rocks, fell asleep
Moon by my head and the sun at my feet
I tried to paint but I got a disease
You and me together could be something free
Got a lot of money but ain't shit free
Suckers everywhere but bitch I'm sucker free
Serpentine, serpentine, snakes in Columbine
Four cups, two cups, I'm swervin' outta mind
Three girls, two nights, I'm seein' stars tonight
Been in this shit so long, I feel traumatised

[Verse 2]
Drop top candlelight, cop drop samurai
I'm sippin' lean mixed with bubbly
Polo’d down Lean, but I don't play no rugby
Don't play no games with me 'cause I play ugly
My team medieval, our helmets are rusty
Helmut Lang, Issey Miyake it must be
Can't take you seriously, nah, you look suspect
I wanna fuck your bones out till you love me
Connection been going down lately, it's nothing
Don't know who to call today
It's summer so I'm chilling straight
On my porch, sipping lemonade
Got Coke and whiskey, hibernate
Snakes in desert in my face
Shotgun and a Issey case
Miyake and Yohji on my pants and diamonds in my face
Don't know who to call today
It's summer so I'm chilling straight
On my porch, sipping lemonade
Got Coke and whiskey, hibernate
Snakes in desert in my face

Lime stone, lime stone, in a cave like lime stone
Off this lean, I move slow like a rhino

Lean up in the club, I'm smoking wind and getting fried
Fuck-fuck-fuck these other guys, I'ma do this till I die
Pink polo dirty stacks 24/7, 9-5

Still in Yoshi City, rollin', rollin' down a hill
I need a new high and I need a new life
I need a hundred million roses on me when I die

Title: Salute / Pacman
Release Date: November 10, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Yung-lean-salute-pacman-lyrics
Song Description: This song contains numerous call backs to Leans life following the recording of his 2016 Album Warlord. Fans of Lean may recall the psychotic breakdown and extended stay in evaluative care that followed while lean was living in Miami. Lean attributed this breakdown to the disconnect created by trying to live the lifestyle he rapped about in his early efforts and who he actually is.

Mixed between the well-worn lines about a lifestyle of excess, appears the central message from Lean. The Warlord persona and his Warlord phase of self-destructive behavior including the internal war that spawned it has now passed; he has made it to the other side, though he is not unscarred from this war. He has been able to find a more authentic version of himself and therefore a more authentic expression of himself musically on Stranger.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yung Leandoer, Sad Boys
Up in this bitch until infinity

[Hook]
Salute to the gang, know where we hang
Bitches 'round the yard, they follow me like Pacman
Salute to the fans, sold my brain gland
Kit Kat Lick on my hip she got a chance
Shawty wanna bang, she look just like a fan
Snortin' in the bathroom, paranoia, where's my men?
Salute to the gang, know where we hang
Girls all around the yard, they follow me like Pacman

[Verse 1]
Got my cup dirty, like I never poured it up
Ridin' through the city with no ceiling, ain't no lookin' up
She just want to please it, I was leanin', they lookin' like us
Touched by the moment, feelin' myself, I'mma cut you off
Stacks on wrist, graveyard wish
Openin' my eyes like I ain't never lived
You know who I'm with, ten-million hits
Put me on your song, I got killer instincts
Ice on slick, Rick Owens on my bitch
Avenger in the night, I be cruisin' grand whips
Slayers stacks like the mayor
Pager, she gon' hit me on my pager
Later, gon' get it now or later
All I want is to get rich, buy a house and some laser

[Verse 2]
I'm a guardian of the moon, white silver withtattoos
We gon' hotbox in the coupe, platonic mind, twilight, two moons
I don't give a fuck, I told you, Silver Surfer soldiers
Went to war, it's over, like my cash, my mind got older
I'm wearing my Timberlands, eatin' on marmalade
Living in vain, I put sparks in a starter brain
Hop out with ice, and I look like a target train
Icy blue veins keep it real, 'cause the market fake
I'm on a mountain, I pour me a double seal
And I need medicine, pour me a benzopan'
Warlord, but I'm not a cyborg, I'm almost real

[Bridge]
Salute to the gang, we can get it
I know we will
I know some people that ain't rockin' with me no more
Triple six, resist and pass out during shows for
Hard feelings start to grow when there's no more
No more
