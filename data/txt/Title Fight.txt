Title: Head in the Ceiling Fan
Release Date: September 18, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Title-fight-head-in-the-ceiling-fan-lyrics
Song Description: Track five on Floral Green by Title Fight, this song portrays the negative cycles of a toxic relationship. The writer feels like a victim, like prey, but doesnt necessarily desire to escape the relationship at the same time. They stay despite the pain because they are in love, however detrimental to them it might be. The song is sampled on multiple other tracks by different artists due to the moving guitar melody in the background.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Jamie Rhoden]
Head in the ceiling
Fan goes rolling
And missing, like bullets
Slamming into deer skin

[Verse: Jamie Rhoden]
Glued my green eyes
To your face, I'm blind
Follow footsteps
A bleeding bloodline

[Chorus: Jamie Rhoden]
Head in the ceiling

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Swept in like a dream
Drew the sting, then I died
White light trembling
Shadows bring tears to eyes

[Verse 1]
Twisted in a summer mist
Burned alive awhile
Wrestled with your loneliness
Echoed from a wire

[Chorus]
Gatling gun, your pain is mine now
See-through smoke, clouds warping around
I know you're scared, but don't cry your eyes out
Gatling gun, under your spell now

[Verse 2]
Swirling through a tunnel view, tangled in the dark
Flirting with a kiss of death, a canopy of stars
You'll sleep beneath them, I'm in your room
I am your nightmare, I am the moon

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Bad luck never leaves
Your jinx just floats around
Like the taste inside your mouth
Or the sound when your skull cracks
Feel the growing pains
It means you're growing up too fast
Telling white lies to black cats
Stretch me out across the tracks

[Chorus]
While you were sleeping, I was blood red
Sharp as a knife inside your stomach
I'm squeezing tight, don't let the light in
No medicine

[Verse 2]
Daydream tendencies
Had you smiling soft and sweet
Keep those blurry memories
Somewhere safe, you may need them
You can make a wish
But there's no rabbit out the hat
Realize it's never coming back
Realize it's never coming back

Title: 27
Release Date: February 10, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Title-fight-27-lyrics
Song Description: This song is about Ned Russins father and his superstitions. In an interview with the Culture Creature podcast, Ned explained: [Superstition] is a thing you do when you have no other option. 27 is a song about my father. His lucky number is 27. He was born on the 27th, got married on the 27th. He says he always sees 27. So its like, what can you do in a moment when your father is on an operating room table with his stomach opened up? Theres nothing you can do other than resort to thinking about some superstition. To me, thats what its about. Im not a superstitious person, at least I try not to be.
Lyrics:

[Verse: Ned Russin]
My father said, "Don't be so scared"
Driving home all alone, you're in a hospital bed
I closed my eyes, ignored the signs
Tried to wake up from a dream, it's not working this time

[Chorus: Ned Russin]
If I said your name twenty-seven times
Would that bring you back to life?
If I said your name twenty-seven times
Would that bring you back to life?

[Bridge: Ned Russin]
Do you remember your lucky number?
Your superstition has me buried six feet under

[Chorus: Ned Russin]
If I said your name twenty-seven times
Would that bring you back to life?
If I said your name twenty-seven times
Would that bring you back to life?

I talk, but no one listens
Can't make my own decisions

[Chorus]
Every night I lie asleep
Trying to wake up from this dream

Try and forget my name, but it's something I just can't change
I threw it all away, but it still stays the same

Title: Leaf
Release Date: September 18, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Title-fight-leaf-lyrics
Song Description: Floral Green, 2012
The narrator clearly has depression never able to say how I was feeling and feels lost, boring and doesnt want to put his burden on others, highlighted by the lines Do you really wanna know? Do you really?. Excessive need to sleep is also a part of depression which the narrator highlights twice. It is also easier to pull down the shades and stay in all day with severe depression. The metaphor of the narrator being a single leaf shows how small he feels and that seeing life as a whole is difficult
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I never was able to say
Just how I was feeling
Can we see the endless stake
And this path I'm leaving

[Bridge]
Do you really wanna know?
Do you really?

[Chorus]
I feel lost
Feel boring
I've been caught
Sleeping all morning

[Verse 2]
Pull down the shades
Rather stay inside all day
My own thoughts are in my way
Rather sleep than have to stay

[Chorus]

Feel boring

Song Description: Flood of 72 is about the flooding of the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania where Title Fight are from. It is remorseful of the flood which was akin to Hurricane Katrina in an area that was once quite prominent for its coal and manufacturing industries (both of which are now gone, leaving the area to struggle more).

The song has references to local landmarks. A giants despair is a reference to a steep drive in the area that (depending on where you are) overlooks the valley.

Your best clothes hanging in the closet, a constant reminder is a reference to the areas former affluence.
Lyrics:

Time and distance blurs the image
So far removed from the life you're used to
Flood of '72 casting shadows over you
A giant's despair

Lyrics:

I try to find myself
In the shadows of my room
But I was suffocated by
Vacant walls
And solitude, solitude

Knee deep, I'm losing sleep
Can't find yourself when you've lost everything
I'm hanging up on to all your words
Beneath the sheets you buried me
I'm suffocating quietly
Is this record on repeat
You left me with the weight of the world to liftYou might also like5Embed

Release Date: May 3, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Title-fight-your-screen-door-lyrics
Song Description: The singer reflects on a previous relationship yet again. In this song, he hastily heads over to her house as his mind is hoarded with the thought of her and what they had together. Everything is starting to cycle back to him as he thinks about her and he decides to see her again, but immediately regrets it. As he arrives to her place again, he begins to understand that the relationship is truly over and theres no use in trying to rekindle things as itll only hurt him more.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I grabbed my things and rode to your place
I knew you'd be there, four twenty three
On your porch swing talking with me
And I'm thinking, "What am I doing?"
This is killing me I'm dying quietly
Four twenty three

[Verse 2]
I heard your name and thought I'd stop by
Cut open your screen door and sneak in slow
Just to say hello to you
And see how you've been doing without me
Call you and see how you've been doing without meYou might also like4Embed

Lyrics:

Being crushed from your closing walls
I never thought it would have come to this
I'd try to tell you but my lungs are being crushed
My voice is the last thing that I thought I'd ever miss
I hope this makes you see just how you destroy me

Now I guess I'm just a liar
Would I be lying if I said "I don't know?"
Now I guess that this is over
And I'm sorry that you have nothing to show

I hope this makes you see just how you destroy me
And I can't do what you please
When I haven't been standing on my own two feet

Can I tell you everything?
All I ever wanted was to be interesting
You said you don't mind
Lie to me one more time

I'm boring
No fun at all
I put my head right through the wall
I tried to make myself feel
No luck this time
Try again next year

I've led myself to believe
The world has turned its back on me
How's that for comforting?
I just want to be interesting

Sorry if you don't see me
As much as you deem necessary
You said you care for your friends
Did you lie or just pretend?

I never wanted sympathy

Song Description: A song about overthinking, and being trapped in your head. Being the first track on Spring Songs, it opened the EP with a powerful, aggressive and soul-crushing wave of emotion. While largely unseen upon release, the song became cherished by fans in the following years.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Last year, I tried to learn
What makes me so insecure
What better way to pass the time?
I lost myself in my mind

[Chorus]
I just want to hear the words you speak
When I'm not around, what do you think?
I think I'm hopeless, I think I think too much
Bruised and broken covered up with blush

[Verse 2]
Tell me what's wrong
With forcing myself to write it down
Never made a sound
I never second guess, I'm right the first time

[Chorus]
I just want to hear the words you speak
When I'm not around, what do you think?
I think I'm hopeless, I think I think too much
Bruised and broken covered up with blush

And to be honest, I couldn't care to fix this
The weather is always changing and I swear that I don't mind

You're spending too much time digging graves
And sharpening your knives
All's well, wish you the best
You disagree with thoughts you would suggest

When doors are closed, and you're stuck inside

Song Description: Ned Russin (Bassist/Vocalist of Title Fight) details this song as his feelings on the last night of a European tour ending in Ireland. He received a phone call from his father about his grandmothers passing, and subsequently found himself feeling completely lost in what he loves to do.

In the same 2011 Inside The Music Interview, Russin considered it the most important song he had ever written.
Lyrics:

I'd also like to thank you for watching me drown

Forgotten all your names, and not answered the phone
Well I guess this brings us to where we are now
I can't stand you anymore
Can't you get that through your head?
I think it's funny that you talk like we are still best friends
I think I'd rather be dead

Tell me what you want, because what I want is what you can't have
I'll take everything

You'll miss me soon

You're a mistake
And so I won't catch you when you fall
It's your fault
And I did nothing wrong at all

Take this knife
Out of my spine
I'll take back what's rightfully mine

I know as time goes, one day you'll need meYou might also likeEmbed

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Verse]
There is weight in the words we've said
Too heavy to carry in our heads
There's a chance that I thought had gone
But here we are, playing along
[Pre-Chorus]
I admit I'm scared
So fragile, emotionally impaired (hopeless)
Damaged goods
So broken, so misunderstood
(wreckless and careless)
[Chorus]
And I can see
That rain cloud that follows me
Looks like the one that follows you
And the same ghosts that keep me awake haunt your nights just the same
[Outro}
All dressed up in black and grey
Wе know each other just the samе
And every mile that sits between
Won't understand what it means
To have one look mean everything
And throw all caution to the sea
I have faith in us if we don't self destructYou might also likeEmbed
