Artist: Joy Division, Alternate Names: Warsaw
Artist Description: Until singer Ian Curtis committed suicide in 1980, Joy Division were one of Britain’s most promising post-punk bands. While the remaining members went on to huge success with the synth-pop band New Order, Joy Division’s legend continued to grow and the band are possibly more popular now than ever before.

Their most famous song is certainly “Love Will Tear Us Apart,” with its iconic introduction and Curtis’s rumbling baritone vocals, but critical attention has primarily been focused towards their two studio albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer, which are regarded as two of the greatest albums of all time. Their sound is centred around Ian Curtis’s bleak lyrics and baritone vocals, backed by Bernard Sumner’s spacious guitar sound, Peter Hook’s melodic bass-playing and Stephen Morris’s driving drum rhythms.

Title: Love Will Tear Us Apart
Release Date: June 1, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-love-will-tear-us-apart-lyrics
Song Description: The lyrics ostensibly reflect the problems in Ian Curtiss marriage to Deborah Curtis, as well as his general frame of mind in the time leading up to his suicide in May 1980.

Curtis was not faithful to his wife while touring with Joy Division. Debbie remained at home with their child and Ian had an affair with a Belgian woman by the name of Annik Honor. Ian fell in love with Annik and the affair weighed heavily on him.

The title is an ironic reference to Captain & Tennilles Love Will Keep Us Together.

  


More broadly interpreted, the lyrics reflect the universality of the tenuous nature of all of our relationships. Many of our careers and agenda lead us into directions away from our loved ones, and often into the arms of others we find there. Certainly the tragic story of Ian wasnt unique among musicians or among most of us.

So when one hears us in this refrain, consider the term to indicate all of us or both of us or me from the band or me from all of you or all of you from me.

Then, love finally tore Ian apart from us, after having emotionally torn him apart, on the eve of his first trip out of Europe. Deborah Curtis had the phrase Love Will Tear Us Apart inscribed on Ian Curtiss memorial stone.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
When routine bites hard
And ambitions are low
And resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways
Taking different roads

[Chorus]
Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

[Verse 2]
Why is the bedroom so cold?
You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect runs so dry
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives

[Chorus]
But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Love, love will tear us apart again
Then love, love will tear it apart again
Love, love will tear it apart again87Embed

Title: Disorder
Release Date: June 15, 1979, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-disorder-lyrics
Song Description: The opening song to the bands most famous album, Disorder do not fail in setting the tone for what is to come.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand
Could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man?
Lose sensation, spare the insults, leave them for another day
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away

[Verse 2]
It's getting faster, moving faster now, it's getting out of hand
On the tenth floor, down the back stairs, into no man's land
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow
[Verse 3]
What means to you, what means to me and we will meet again
I'm watching you, I'm watching her, I'll take no pity from your friends
Who is right, who can tell and who gives a damn right now?
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know

[Outro]
I've got the spirit
But lose the feeling
I've got the spirit
But lose the feeling

Title: New Dawn Fades
Release Date: June 15, 1979, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-new-dawn-fades-lyrics
Song Description: One of the many reasons Unknown Pleasures is the landmark album it is, New Dawn Fades was the most overt turn by Joy Division on that record towards an epic rock moment, drawing on everything from Black Sabbaths anti-anthems to krautrocks clean, steady drive.

A strange, looped instrumental moan heralds the rhythm sections appearance, with Peter Hooks bass as sepulchral as could be asked for and Bernard Sumners guitar sounding like its trying to slowly scale an impossible height, trying to rise above where it was.

Ian Curtiss vocals reflect on personal connection and its tangled collapse, of trying to escape a poisonous entropy in search of feeling  the initial slight echo and almost half-whispered singing eventually turns into a near howl, the melodramatic becoming obsessively personal and strong, hoping for something more. Sumners concluding riff makes for a moment of light in this otherwise astonishingly dark, powerful composition.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
A change of speed, a change of style
A change of scene, with no regrets
A chance to watch, admire the distance
Still occupied, though you forget
Different colours, different shades
Over each mistakes were made
I took the blame
Directionless so plain to see
A loaded gun won't set you free
So you say

[Verse 2]
We'll share a drink and step outside
An angry voice and one who cried
We'll give you everything and more
The strain's too much, can't take much more
Oh, I've walked on water, run through fire
Can't seem to feel it anymore

[Outro]
It was me, waiting for me
Hoping for something more

Title: Shadowplay
Release Date: June 15, 1979, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-shadowplay-lyrics
Song Description: On Shadowplay, the guitars launch into a dimension reminiscent of the sonic dimensions that David Bowie and Brian Eno dwelt in during the late 1970s. The bands sound is echoey and cavernous, but thanks to Factory Records producer Martin Hannett, it was never empty. By adding sound effects such as breaking glass, deep breaths, and footsteps, Hannett brings the music out of the mental torture of the lead singer and into the real world. Its these details that keep you with it and make it feel more measured than their manic live performances. For this, however, he was initially resented by the band.

The title Shadowplay makes the bands gigs resemble play[s] presented by casting shadows of puppets or actors on a screen. Ian feels like he is no real person to the audience, and feels like he is just enacting what they want to see, although they dont even regard him as an actor; they see him as a mere shadow of the actor.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
To the centre of the city where all roads meet
Waiting for you
To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank
Searching for you
I was moving through the silence without motion
Waiting for you
In a room with a window in the corner
I found truth

[Verse 2]
In the shadowplay, acting out your own death
Knowing no more
As the assassins all grouped in four lines
Dancing on the floor
And with cold steel, odour on their bodies
Made a move to connect
But I could only stare in disbelief
As the crowds all left

[Outro]
I did everything, everything I wanted to
I let them use you for their own ends
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you

Title: She’s Lost Control
Release Date: June 15, 1979, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-shes-lost-control-lyrics
Song Description: Released as both an album cut and, in a hint of where New Order would eventually find itself, Shes Lost Control drew inspiration from Ian Curtiss encounter with an epilepsy victim and her attendant lack of control over her own body. It was something Curtis also suffered from, and the chilling sense of desperation and fear shot through the lyrics draws on more than a dramatic gift.

The deep echoes on the album version of his vocals make that version more of a disturbing listen, but on both the music is excellent, the steady death disco punch of the arrangement as much a harbinger for early 1980s experiments all over the world as anything. Peter Hooks memorable, softly descending bassline gets a rougher counterpart with Bernard Sumners clipped, chugging riff, and the whole sounds like a disturbing vision into a world many would never know otherwise.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Confusion in her eyes that says it all
She's lost control
And she's clinging to the nearest passer by
She's lost control
And she gave away the secrets of her past
And said, "I've lost control again"
And to the voice that told her when and where to act
She said, "I've lost control again"

[Verse 2]
And she turned around and took me by the hand
And said, "I've lost control again"
And how I'll never know just why or understand
She said, "I've lost control again"
And she screamed out, kicking on her side, and said
"I've lost control again"
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die
She said, "I've lost control"

[Chorus]
She's lost control again
She's lost control

Until she lost control again
And walked upon the edge of no escape
And laughed, "I've lost control"

[Chorus]

Title: Day of the Lords
Release Date: June 15, 1979, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-day-of-the-lords-lyrics
Song Description: The haunting Day Of The Lords is one of the longer, slower songs on Unknown Pleasures. Its meaning is contested, with some hearing it as depicting the horrors of war, while others hear it as a companion piece to Shes Lost Control in sympathising with someone with epilepsy.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
This is the room, the start of it all
No portrait so fine, only sheets on the wall
I've seen the nights, filled with bloodsport and pain
And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained

[Refrain]

Title: Isolation
Release Date: July 18, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-isolation-lyrics
Song Description: Isolation is probably the Joy Division track that is most prophetic of the groups New Order future, with its relatively upbeat feel and bright-sounding synths. However, the lyrics tell a very different story, one of Curtiss sense of isolation within his marriage to Deborah, damaged by his affair with Belgian journalist Annik Honor, and his feelings of detachment from the world in general, his typically deadpan delivery sitting uncomfortably above the fast, new wave backdrop.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
In fear every day, every evening
He calls her aloud from above
Carefully watched for a reason
Painstaking devotion and love
Surrendered to self preservation
From others who care for themselves
A blindness that touches perfection
But hurts just like anything else

[Chorus]
Isolation

[Verse 2]

Title: Atmosphere
Release Date: March 18, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-atmosphere-lyrics
Song Description: The song that John Peel played after announcing Ian Curtiss death is unbearably close and brooding, but allows the occasional shaft of light. Stephen Morriss pattering drums rouse Atmosphere from troubled slumber, while Bernard Sumners glittering, chiming keyboards give it a bright beauty. Its a shimmer that remains even as Curtis grips the microphone with increasing intensity.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Walk in silence
Don't walk away, in silence

See the danger, always danger
Endless talking, life rebuilding
Don't walk away

Worn like a mask of self-hate, confronts and then dies

Title: Insight
Release Date: June 15, 1979, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-insight-lyrics
Song Description: Insight is perhaps one of the most overlooked Joy Division songs and probably one of their saddest, too. It is the track from Unknown Pleasures that most explicitly deals with the theme of death and Curtiss apathy towards living, which he rages about over a gentle but driving rhythm section.

The song begins with the sound of a lift at Strawberry Studios, where the album was recorded.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Guess your dreams always end
They don't rise up, just descend
But I don't care anymore
I've lost the will to want more
I'm not afraid not at all
I watch them all as they fall
But I remember
When we were young

[Verse 2]
Those with habits of waste
Their sense of style and good taste
Of making sure you were right
Hey, don't you know you were right?
I'm not afraid anymore
I keep my eyes on the door
But I remember

[Verse 3]
Tears of sadness for you
More upheaval for you
Reflects a moment in time
A special moment in time
Yeah, we wasted our time
We didn't really have time
But we remember
When we were young

Title: Candidate
Release Date: June 15, 1979, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-candidate-lyrics
Song Description: In this piece, Joy Division makes an analogy between the harshness and difficulties that can be found in the juridic and political procedure to become a leader of men and the subjective procedure to get to someones heart.

Portrayed by the Candidate, hell give it all, even his life, to get to his goal; either if we interpret hes chasing a girls love or a political position.

Candidate, along with non-album track From Safety to Where, was composed in the studio when the band found themselves short of enough songs to fill the album. According to Peter Hook in 2012:

Martin [Hannett, producer] needed two more songs and he said to me and Steve [Morris], Youve not got enough songs. You need to go in and write two more songs. [] So we took ourselves off and started writing  well, jamming. We got Candidate immediately
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Forced by the pressure
The territories marked
No longer the pleasure
Oh, I've since lost the heart
Corrupted from memory
No longer the power
It's creeping up slowly:
The last fatal hour
Oh, I don't know what made me
Or what gave me the right
To mess with your values
And change wrong to right

[Verse 2]
Please keep your distance
The trail leads to here
There's blood on your fingers
Brought on by fear
I campaigned for nothing
I worked hard for this
I tried to get to you
You treat me like this
It's just second nature
It's what we've been shown
We're living by your rules
That's all that we know

Title: Heart and Soul
Release Date: July 18, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-heart-and-soul-lyrics
Song Description: Heart and Soul is a spacious, reverb-laden track built around an electronic bass line from Peter Hook and a skittering drum rhythm from Stephen Morris. Ian Curtis sings in his typically melancholic style, while Bernard Sumner plays a repetitive two-chord progression. It is also one of a small handful of Joy Division tracks that features a synthesizer, but unlike the bright leads that appear on Love Will Tear Us Apart and Isolation, the electronics here provide a moody, atmospheric backdrop.

The lyrics deal with the dichotomy between instinct and reason, between emotion and thought. In line with several other tracks on Closer, it wouldnt be unreasonable to suggest that this more specifically refers to Curtiss affair with Belgian journalist Annik Honor, and the battle in his mind between whether or not to continue it at the potential expense of his marriage.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Instincts that can still betray us
A journey that leads to the sun
Soulless and bent on destruction
A struggle between right and wrong
You take my place in the showdown
I'll observe with a pitiful eye
I'll humbly ask for forgiveness
A request well beyond you and I

[Chorus]
Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn

[Verse 2]
An abyss that laughs at creation
A circus complete with all fools
Foundations that lasted the ages
Then ripped apart at their roots
Beyond all this good is the terror
The grip of a mercenary hand
When savagery turns all good reason
There's no turning back, no last stand

[Chorus]
Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn

Title: Atrocity Exhibition
Release Date: July 18, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-atrocity-exhibition-lyrics
Song Description: The title of this track comes from J.G. Ballards disturbing, surrealistic short story collection The Atrocity Exhibition, which sees a name-changing protagonist creating bizarre fantasies about celebrities, such as Ronald Reagan and Marilyn Monroe, in his head, often to the point where the line between these inner imaginings and reality is blurred. Though the precise meaning of Joy Divisions Atrocity Exhibition is unclear, it does create a similarly unnerving atmosphere, painting grotesque lyrical pictures of chaos, massacre and lunacy.

From a compositional standpoint, this is one of the bands most daring and unsettling tracks. Built around Stephen Morriss incessant tribal drumming and Peter Hooks screeching, snarling guitar, its a far cry from Shadowplays straightforward post-punk drive.

The song was immensely influential, inspiring artists as stylistically opposed as The Cure and Danny Brown.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Asylums with doors open wide
Where people had paid to see inside
For entertainment they watch his body twist
Behind his eyes he says, "I still exist"

This is the way, step inside

Title: Twenty Four Hours
Release Date: July 18, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-twenty-four-hours-lyrics
Song Description: Twenty Four Hours is a song that explores the theme of loss and the fleeting nature of time. The lyrics convey a sense of nostalgia and regret for what once was, as well as a feeling of anxiety and hopelessness about the future.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
So this is permanence, love's shattered pride
What once was innocence, turned on its side
A cloud hangs over me, marks every move
Deep in the memory, of what once was love

[Verse 2]
Oh how I realised how I wanted time
Put into perspective, tried so hard to find
Just for one moment, thought I'd found my way
Destiny unfolded, I watched it slip away

[Verse 3]
Excessive flash points, beyond all reach
Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep
Let's take a ride out, see what we can find
A valueless collection of hopes and past desires

[Verse 4]
I never realised the lengths I'd have to go
All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know
Just for one moment, I heard somebody call
Looked beyond the day in hand, there's nothing there at all

[Verse 5]
Now that I've realised how it's all gone wrong
Gotta find some therapy, this treatment takes too long
Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway
Gotta find my destiny, before it gets too lateYou might also like12Embed

Title: Interzone
Release Date: June 15, 1979, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-interzone-lyrics
Song Description: Interzone is easily the most straightforward song on Unknown Pleasures. Its unique in Joy Divisions catalogue, as the lead vocal duties are given to bassist Peter Hook, while Ian Curtis takes backing vocals. Hook would go on to sing on New Orders Dreams Never End and Doubts Even Here off their debut album.

This track was originally styled on the backing track of Keep On Keeping On by Nolan Porter. The band attempted to record the song for a demo commissioned by RCA records, but after struggling to replicate the song, Bernard Sumner took the riff, inverted it and played it faster. The band then presented RCA with Interzone.

The title Interzone also refers to a section of the city of Tangiers in Morocco, as portrayed by William S. Burroughs in his 1959 book Naked Lunch. At the time, the city was a hotbed for cold war spies, other emigres and homosexual activity. It was thus known as International Zone, which was shortened as Interzone in the novel, serving also as a working title for it at one point. Burroughs also wrote a short story called international Zone (which was published in a book called Interzone). All these references can be traced back to his time living in the city of Tangiers, which greatly influenced him.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I walked through the city limits
(Someone talked me in to try and do it)
Attracted by some force within it
(Had to close my eyes to get close to it)
Around a corner where a prophet lay
(Saw the place where she'd had a room to stay)
A wire fence where the children played
(Saw the bed where the body lay)

[Refrain]
And I was looking for a friend of mine
(And I had no time to waste)
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine

[Verse 2]
The cars screeched, hear the sound on dust
(Heard a noise, just a car outside)
Metallic blue turned red with rust
(Pulled in close by the building's side)
In a group all forgotten youth
(Had to think, collect my senses now)
Are turned on to a knife-edged view
(Find some places where my friends don't know)

[Refrain]
And I was looking for a friend of mine
(And I had no time to waste)
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine

(Trying to move away, had to move away and keep out)

[Verse 3]
Four, twelve windows, ten in a row
(Behind a wall, well, I looked down low)
The light shined like a neon show
(Inserted deep, felt a warmer glow)
No place to stop, no place to go
(No time to lose, had to keep on going)

Title: The Eternal
Release Date: July 18, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-the-eternal-lyrics
Song Description: Arguably the bleakest thing the band ever recorded, The Eternal is a slow and atmospheric track built around a repetitive bassline and reverb-laden drums and piano. According to guitarist Bernard Sumner, Ian Curtis wrote The Eternal about a child with Downs Syndrome who lived near him. The child was not allowed to leave his house. When, Ian moved back to Macclesfield when he was 22 he noticed how, even though his life had changed, the childs life appeared to have remained the same, as Stephen Morris told GQ in July 2020:

He used to go and see him at the labour exchange, but youd also see him playing in the park and he never seemed to age. He just always stayed the same.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Procession moves on, the shouting is over
Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone
Talking aloud as they sit round their tables
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain
Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment
Possessed by a fury that burns from inside

[Verse 2]
Cry like a child, though these years make me older
With children my time is so wastefully spent
A burden to keep, though their inner communion
Accept like a curse an unlucky deal
Played by the gate at the foot of the garden
My view stretches out from the fence to the wall
No words could explain, no actions determine

Song Description: Its amusing how the second half of Unknown Pleasures (Shadowplay, Wilderness and Interzone specifically) in no way prepares the listener for I Remember Nothing. Shadowplay is almost an honest-to-god arena rock tune. I Remember Nothing, on the other hand, is a kind of cousin to The Stooges' We Will Fall, and the one of the bleakest tunes in the Joy Division discography.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
We were strangers
We were strangers
For way too long
For way too long
We were strangers (Violent)
For way too long (Violent)
We're strangers

[Verse 1]
Get weak all the time
May just pass the time
Me in my own world
Yeah, you there beside
The gaps are enormous
We stare from each side
We were strangers
For way too long

[Verse 2]
Violent, more violent, his hand cracks the chair
Moves on reaction, then slumps in despair
Trapped in a cage and surrendered too soon
Me in my own world
The one that you knew (For way too long)

Title: A Means to an End
Release Date: July 18, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-a-means-to-an-end-lyrics
Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
A legacy so far removed
One day will be improved
Eternal rights we left behind
We were the better kind
Two the same, set free too

[Chorus]
I always looked to you
I always looked to you
I always looked to you

[Verse 2]
We fought for good, stood side by side
Our friendship never died
On stranger waves, the lows and highs
Our vision touched the sky
Immortalists with points to prove

[Chorus]
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you

[Verse 3]
A house somewhere on foreign soil
Where aging lovers call
Is this your goal, your final needs
Where dogs and vultures eat
Committed still I turn to go

Title: Passover
Release Date: July 18, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-passover-lyrics
Song Description: The title of Passover refers to the Jewish celebration of the same name, and more specifically to the Biblical story it commemorates, in which the enslaved Israelites painted their doors with lambs blood to protect them from the final deadly plague of Egypt. While the lyrics themselves do refer to this practice, they are rather vague in their overall focus, as drummer Stephen Morris recalled in 2020:

Id love to be able to ask [Ian Curtis] what the lyrics were about. He was going to do divinity at school. He was interested in religion.

Musically the song features a steady beat from Morris, enhanced by a hissing reverb effect, while Bernard Sumner plays crunchy arpeggiated guitar chords, and Ian Curtis sings a descending, almost question-and-answer-like melody. The track also marks Peter Hooks recorded debut on six-string bass.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
This is a crisis I knew had to come
Destroying the balance I'd kept
Doubting, unsettling, and turning around
Wondering what will come next
Is this the role that you wanted to live?
I was foolish to ask for so much
Without the protection and infancy's guard
It all falls apart at first touch

[Verse 2]
Watching the reel as it comes to a close
Brutally taking its time
People who change for no reason at all
It's happening all of the time
Can I go on with this train of events?
Disturbing and purging my mind
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done
I know that I'll lose every time

[Verse 3]
Moving along in our God-given ways
Safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles
Left with a mark on the door
Is this the gift that I wanted to give?
Forgive and forget's what they teach
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more
And watch as they drown by the beach

Title: Warsaw
Release Date: June 3, 1978, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-warsaw-lyrics
Song Description: The song appears to be a lyrical biography of Rudolf Hess, a Nazi and Hitlers confidante, who later became disillusioned with Hitlers rule and fled to Scotland in an attempt to draw peace between the Axis and the Allies. Told from from Hess' point of view.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Three, five, oh, one, two, five, go

[Verse 1]
I was there in the back stage
When first light came around
I grew up like a changeling
To win the first time around
I can see all the weakness
I can pick all the faults
Well I concede all the faith tests
Just to stick in your throats

[Chorus]
31G, 31G, 31G

[Verse 2]
I hung around in your soundtrack
To mirror all that you've done
To find the right side of reason
To kill the three lies for one
I can see all the cold facts
I can see through your eyes
All this talk made no contact
No matter how hard we tried

Title: Wilderness
Release Date: June 15, 1979, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-wilderness-lyrics
Song Description: Wilderness is about the ways organised religion can lead people astray and be a hindrance to progress. Like many of the tracks on Unknown Pleasures, it is built on a distinctive Peter Hook bassline, which Bernard Summers power chords follow for most of the track. In the background, the simple but busy-sounding drum rhythm is laden with reverb and echo effects, making them pan between the left and right channels throughout.

According to Hook, manager Rob Gretton was not a fan of Wilderness.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I traveled far and wide through many different times
What did you see there?
I saw the saints with their toys
What did you see there?
I saw all knowledge destroyed

[Chorus]
I traveled far and wide through many different times

[Verse 2]
I traveled far and wide through prisons of the cross
What did you see there?
The power and glory of sin
What did you see there?
The blood of Christ on their skins

[Chorus]
I traveled far and wide through many different times

[Verse 3]
I traveled far and wide and unknown martyrs died
What did you see there?
I saw the one sided trials
What did you see there?
I saw the tears as they cried
They had tears in their eyes
Tears in their eyes
Tears in their eyes

Title: Dead Souls
Release Date: March 18, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-dead-souls-lyrics
Song Description: An examination of the internal and external crises facing Ian Curtis, Dead Souls' opens with one of the singers most despairing lines: a plea for the certainty that he has nothing left to live for. Dead Souls also marks a musical milestone for Joy Division as the long jam that opens the song is a transition between the rock-based sound of Unknown Pleasures and the complex, mechanical rhythms of Closer.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Someone take these dreams away
That point me to another day
A duel of personalities
That stretch all true realities

[Chorus]
That keep calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me

[Verse 2]
Where figures from the past stand tall
And mocking voices ring the halls
Imperialistic house of prayer
Conquistadors who took their share

[Chorus]
That keep calling me
They keep calling me

Title: Colony
Release Date: July 18, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-colony-lyrics
Song Description: Colony addresses the recurring theme of isolation and alienation, which was a prominent topic in Joy Divisions music. The song explores the desolation and emptiness that can pervade modern society, highlighting the sense of disconnectedness that individuals may experience. The title Colony itself suggests a group of people living together but still feeling detached from one another, mirroring the idea of a collective yet lonely existence.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
A cry for help, a hint of anesthesia
The sound from broken homes, we used to always meet here
As he lays asleep, she takes him in her arms
Some things I have to do, but I don't mean you harm

[Verse 2]
A worried parent's glance, a kiss, a last goodbye
Hands him the bag she packed, the tears she tries to hide
A cruel wind that bows down to our lunacy
And leaves him standing cold here in this colony

[Verse 3]
I can't see why all these confrontations
I can't see why all these dislocations
No family life, this makes me feel uneasy
Stood alone here in this colony

[Chorus]
In this colony
In this colony
In this colony
In this colony

Song Description: This song first appeared on A Factory Sample, the first vinyl record released by Factory Records. It was also the last song played live by Joy Division at their Birmingham University show, just over two weeks before Ian Curtiss death.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]

[Refrain]

Title: No Love Lost
Release Date: June 3, 1978, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-no-love-lost-lyrics
Song Description: This song first appeared on Joy Divisions debut EP An Ideal for Living, afterwards it appeared on the Substance compilation.

Originally the song had a much longer instrumental intro and shorter lyrics. The original song was also slower and sung less energetically.

The lyrics showed here belong to the version in Substance, the main difference between the two versions is the recited section between the verses.

This song references the book from which the band got its name: House of Dolls by Author Ka-Tsetnik 135633. The book deals mainly with Freudenabteilung or Joy Divisions; groups of Jewish women in Nazi concentration camps who were kept for the pleasure of Nazi soldiers and non-Jewish prisoners.
Lyrics:

[Introduction]

[Verse 1]
So long sitting here, didn't hear the warning
Waiting for the tape to run
We've been moving around in different situations
Knowing that the time would come
Just to see you torn apart
Witness to your empty heart

[Chorus]
I need it
I need it
I need it

[Bridge]
Through the wire screen
The eyes of those standing outside looked in at her
As into the cage of some rare creature in a zoo
In the hand of one of the assistants
She saw the same instrument
Which they had that morning
Inserted deep into her body
She shuddered instinctively
No life at all in the house of dolls
No love lost
No love lost

Title: Ceremony (Live at Birmingham University, Birmingham, 2nd May 1980)
Release Date: October 8, 1981, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-ceremony-live-at-birmingham-university-birmingham-2nd-may-1980-lyrics
Song Description: One of the primary and captivating differences between the initial Joy Division version of Ceremony and New Orders take are the lyrics. Curtiss original lyrics were never written down and no full-proof copy of the lyrics is actually exists.

The original lyrics remain a mystery to this day and this mystery almost adds to power this song carries, also being one of the last songs written by Joy Division.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
This is why it’s so unnerving
Then again the same old story
This is why the wheels are turning
Turn away and turn again, this time
This is not the same old story
Not again, but we will be here
Travel fast and now I’m stopping
Turn again and turn towards this time

[Verse 2]
I’ll break them all, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, it’s got to get closer
Watching her, these things she said
The times she cried
Too frail to wake this time

[Verse 3]
I’ll break them all, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, it’s got to get closer
Avenues all lined with trees
Picture me and then you start watching
Watching forever, watching forever

Title: In A Lonely Place
Release Date: December 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-in-a-lonely-place-lyrics
Song Description: The original versions of both this song and Ceremony were apparently discovered by Peter Hook on an old tape. Both songs later came to be reworked and released as New Orders first singles.

This version and Ceremony have come to be known as the Graveyard sessions due to their place of recording. (Graveyard Studios, Prestwich)

The subject matter is perhaps the darkest lead singer Ian Curtis ever wrote; Singing as if he was already dead and hanging above the ground: this was the very last song written and performed by Joy Division.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Caressing the marble and stone
Love that was special for one
The waste in the fever and heat
How I wish you were here with me now

[Verse 2]
Body that curls in and hides
Hardships that often belie
Warm like a dog round your feet
How I wish you were here with me now

[Verse 3]
Hangman looks round as he waits
Cord stretches tight then it breaks
Someday we will die in your dreams

Song Description: Being released closer to the birth of the band, Leaders of Men comes up with a more punk, political vibe than the rest of their later work and appeared on their debut EP An Ideal For Living.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Born from some mother's womb
Just like any other room
Made a promise for a new life
Made a victim out of your life

[Bridge 1]
When your time's out the door
And it flips to the floor
And you feel you can touch
All the noise is too much
And the seeds that are sown
Are no longer your own

[Verse 2]
Just a minor operation
To force a final ultimatum
Thousand words are spoken loud
Reach the dumb to fool the crowd

[Bridge 2]
When you walk down the street
And the sound's not so sweet
And you wish you could hide
Maybe go for a ride
To some peep show arcade
Where the future's not made

Smacks of past Holy wars

Made a promise for a new life

Self-induced manipulation
To crush all thoughts of man's salvation2Embed

Title: Walked in Line
Release Date: October 8, 1981, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-walked-in-line-lyrics
Song Description: Ian Curtis, Stephen Morris, Peter Hook and Bernard Sumner settled stated that all their fathers had fought in World War II. Thats why
Joy Division talks a lot about Nazism in their songs (see for example the song No Love Lost).

Also, the bands name came from the Nazi era, where Nazi officers stationed at concentration camps used the expression Joy Division in reference to the younger women imprisoned there  women that they frequently raped.

This very song, Walked In Line, is another song about Nazism.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
All dressed in uniforms so fine
They drank and killed to pass the time
Wearing the shame of all their crimes
With measured steps, they walked in line

[Chorus]
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line

[Verse 2]
They carried pictures of their wives
And numbered tags to prove their lives
And made it through the whole machine
With dirty hearts and hands washed clean

[Chorus]
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line
They walked in line, they walked in line

Title: Novelty
Release Date: October 7, 1979, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-novelty-lyrics
Song Description: Joy Division has stated that this song is about the 1970s punk scene coming to an end.

All the young generation of that era lived for an ideal, the punk ideal. And now that the punk movement  was in crisis, what all these young people would do? What were they live for?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
When the people listen to you, don't you know it means a lot?
Because you've got to work so hard for everything you've got
Can't rest on your laurels now - not when you've got none
You'll find yourself in the gutter, right back where you came from

[Verse 2]
Someone told me being in the know is the main thing
We all need the security that belonging brings
Can't stand on your own in these times against all the odds
You all just fall behind like all the other sods

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
You slap our backs and pretend you knew about
All the things that we were gonna do
What you're gonna do?
What you're gonna do when it's over?

[Verse 3]
You're all on your own now - don't you think that it's a shame?
But you're the only one responsible to take the blame
So what you're gonna do when the novelty is gone?
Yeah, what you're gonna do when the novelty is gone?

Title: Ice Age
Release Date: October 8, 1981, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-ice-age-lyrics
Song Description: One of the first and most punk-oriented songs in the Joy Division catalogue, it was written and first recorded when the band was still called Warsaw. The nuclear war theme would became a staple for punk rock lyrics all around the world.

At least two studio versions were officially released: an April 1979 recording from the Licht und Blindheit sessions appeared on the compilation album Still in 1981. An earlier take from May 1978, was recorded for the defunct album Warsaw, which was eventually released in 1994. The working title on the Warsaw album was Living in the Ice Age.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I've seen the real atrocities
Buried in the sand
Stockpiled safety for a few
While we stand holding hands

[Chorus 1]
I'm living in the Ice Age
I'm living in the Ice Age
Nothing will hold, nothing will fit
Into the cold, it's not an eclipse
Living in the Ice Age
Living in the Ice Age
Living in the Ice Age

[Verse 2]
Searching for another way
Hide behind the door
We'll live in holes and disused shafts
Hopes for little more

[Chorus 2]
I'm living in the Ice Age
I'm living in the Ice Age
Nothing will hold, nothing will fit
Into the cold, no smile on your lips

Title: Failures
Release Date: June 3, 1978, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-failures-lyrics
Song Description: Failures marks Ground Zero for the band who would become post-punk pioneers. All unhindered thrash and nerve-exposed energy, Failures is Joy Divisions most obvious hat-tip to the Sex Pistols. While Curtis' vocals are nigh-on unrecognisable from the unearthly croon he would discover in the months to come on the bands debut LP Unknown Pleasures, his themes and imagery of disillusionment with the modern world are starting to form the basis from which he would launch his writing.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Don't speak of false messiahs
Failure of the modern man
To the center of all life's desires
As a whole not an also-ran

[Verse 2]
Love in a hollow field
Break the image of your father's son
Drawn to an inner feel
He was thought of as the only one

[Chorus]
He no longer denies
All the failures of the Modern Man
He no longer pick sides
Sees the failures of the Modern Man

[Verse 3]
Wise words and sympathy
Tell the story of our history
New strength gives a real touch
Sense and reason make it all too much

[Verse 4]
With a strange fatality
Break the spirits of a lesser man

Lyrics:

[Verse]
This is the hour when the mysteries emerge
A strangeness so hard to reflect
A moment so moving, goes straight to your heart
The vision has never been met
The attraction is held like a weight deep inside
Something I'll never forget
The pattern is set, her reaction will start
Complete but rejected too soon
Looking ahead in the grip of each fear
Recalls the life that we knew
The shadow that stood by the side of the road
Always reminds me of you
How can I find the right way to control
All the conflict inside, all the problems beside

Title: Autosuggestion
Release Date: October 5, 1979, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-autosuggestion-lyrics
Song Description: Joy Divisions Autosuggestion seems to be related to actual autosuggestion, which is a psychological technique related to the Placebo effect.

Autosuggestion is the act of someone repeating a verbal phrase so that an idea may remain within his/her mind subconsciously. This is sometimes done during therapy so that person may change his/her behavior.

Interestingly, autosuggestion is usually used by those who feel powerless in their own lives and/or suffer from mental illnesses such a depression or anxiety.

Something to note is that Ian Curtis is considered by many to have suffered from mental illnesses as he took his own life by means of hanging on May 18, 1980. However, it wasnt documented whether or not Ian engaged in auto suggestive therapy.

Title: The Only Mistake
Release Date: October 8, 1981, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-the-only-mistake-lyrics
Song Description: Ian Curtis speaks on how a certain new relationship is similar to a previous one where he has a tendency just to take from a woman until the breaking point. This couple had an unequal give/take relationship which ultimately led to a purpose turned sour. The days of loving have turned to strain on both of them. The woman ran away either physically or emotionally because she could not bare the strain any longer.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Made the fatal mistake
Like I did once before
Tendency just to take
Till the purpose turned sour

[Chorus 1]
Strain, take the strain
These days we love
Strain, take the strain

Yeah, the only mistake

Lyrics:

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Two ways to choose
A razor's edge
Remain behind
Go straight ahead
Room full of people
Room for just one
If I can't break out now
The time just won't come

[Verse 2]
Two ways to choose
Which way to go?
Decide for me
Please let me know
Looked in the mirror
Saw I was wrong
I could get back to
Where I belong, where I belong

[Verse 3]
Two ways to choose
Which way to go?
Had thoughts for one
Designs for both
But we were immortal
We were not there
Washed up on the beaches
Struggling for air

Torments yet calms, won't set me free

Title: Sister Ray [Live At the Moonlight Club, London April 1980]
Release Date: October 8, 1981, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-sister-ray-live-at-the-moonlight-club-london-april-1980-lyrics
Song Description: Sister Ray is a cover of the Velvet Underground song of the same name, from their second album White Light/White Heat.



The song is about a party with transvestite prostitutes, sailors, and other junkies, who shoot heroin together and have an orgy. The event is cut short by the police, and some people are shot.

Joy Divisions lyrics are a little bit different than on the original work, and it is also shorter. While the Velvet Underground clocked this on their album at more than 17 minutes, this version is closer to 5.
Lyrics:

Jimmy came from Carolina
Wants to know a way to earn a dollar
Says he's suffering with a fever

Oh, I couldn't hit it sideways

Lying cold for a quarter hour
Took it out of his suitcase
Shot him dead right on the floor
Hey, man, you shouldn't do that
Don't you know you'll stain the carpet

Too busy sucking on a ding-dong
Hey, don't you know you'll stain the carpet?

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Confusion in her eyes that says it all
She's lost control
And she's clinging to the nearest passer by
She's lost control
And she gave away the secrets of her past
And said I've lost control again
And a voice that told her when and where to act
She said I've lost control again

[Verse 2]
And she turned around and took me by the hand and said
I've lost control again
And how i'll never know just why or understand
She said I've lost control again
And she screamed out kicking on her side and said
I've lost control again
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die
She said I've lost control again

[Hook]
She's lost control again
She's lost control

Well I had to 'phone her friend to state my case
And say she's lost control again
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes
And said I've lost control again
But she expressed herself in many different ways
Until she lost control again
And walked upon the edge of no escape
And laughed I've lost control again

[Hook]
She's lost control again
She's lost control
She's lost control again
She's lost control

[Outro]

When the darkness broke in, I just broke down and cried
I could live a little in a wider line
When the change is gone, when the urge is gone

Lyrics:

So long sitting here
Didn't hear the warning
Waiting for the tape to run
We've been moving around in different situations
Knowing that the time would come
Just to see you torn apart
Witness to your empty heart
I need it
I need it
I need it

They like to watch everything you do
Transmitters hidden in the walls
So they know everything you say is true
Turn it on
Don't turn it on
Turn it on

[Verse 2]
You've been seeing things
In darkness, not in learning
Hoping that the truth will pass
No life underground, wasting never changing
Wishing that this day won't last
To never see you show your age
To watch until the beauty fades

Release Date: January 1, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-at-a-later-date-lyrics
Song Description: This early Joy Division rarity is one of the songs they performed at the Electric Circus in Manchester, on October 2, 1977 back when they were still known as Warsaw.

This song was first released as a live recording on the record known as Short Circuit: Live at the Electric Circus in June of 1978, just two weeks after the release of An Ideal for Living, their first EP under the name Joy Division.

The live version of the song infamously opens with Bernard Sumner belting You all forgot Rudolf Hess!
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Why must we be put down when we try to get away?
Why must we all grow up when we could just play and play?
Good things in life are free, can't buy everything, that's true
Only one thing wrong with that, what it don't buy I don't use

Only thing I'm thinking of is "Why are we all here?"
There must be more to do at night than drinking rotten beer
The world's a very shady place, and you can't trust a soul
"Grin and bear it" seemed the thing, when it just gets a hold

At a later date - it might come out a fright
At a later date - I hope that you're alright

Human beings are dangerous and they call me in the dark
But everything gets twice as cold in marching for a lark
There's loads of things I'd like to do if I could find the time
Working really tires me and I think I'll turn to crime

At a later date - I hope they start it soon
At a later date - before we hit the moon

I just can't be bothered to make an effort here at all
People make you feel your contributions are too small

At a later date - I'll be awful great
At a later date - someone somewhere blew it

You'll find yourself in the gutter, right back where you came from

[Verse 2]
Someone told me being in the know is the main thing
We all need the security that belonging brings
Can't stand on your own in these times against all the odds
I don't want to act uncool like all the other sods

You slap our backs and pretend you knew
About all the things that we were going to do
What you going to do?
What you going to do when it's over?

[Verse 3]
You're all on your own now - don't you think that it's a shame?
But you're the only one responsible that's to blame
When you going to grow up and act, and be yourself?
Because pretty soon you'll find yourself nailed to the shelf

Lyrics:

This is why it's called unnerving
Would you say the same old story?
This is why the wheels are turning
Turn away and turn again this time
Listen now the savior's calling
Try again and we will be here
Travelled fast but now I'm stopping
Think again and change its way this time

Oh, I'll break them all no mercy shown, heaven knows I've got to get somewhere
Watching her, a sinking ship
The times she cried, too frail to wake this time

I'll break them all no mercy shown, heaven knows it's got to be somewhere

Watching forever

Lyrics:

So this is permanence, love's shattered pride
What once was innocence, turned on its side
A cloud hangs over me, marks every move
Deep in the memory, of what once was love

Oh, how I realised how I wanted time
Put into perspective, tried so hard to find
Just for one moment, thought I'd found my way
Destiny unfolded, I watched it slip away

Excessive flash points, beyond all reach
Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep
Let's take a ride out, see what we can find
A valueless collection of hopes and past desires

I never realised the lengths I'd have to go
All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know
Just for one moment, I heard somebody call
Looked beyond the day in hand, there's nothing there at all

Now that I've realised how it's all gone wrong
Gotta find some therapy, this treatment takes too long
Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway
Gotta find my destiny, before it gets too lateYou might also like1Embed

Title: Love Will Tear Us Apart [Pennine Version]
Release Date: June 27, 1980, URL: https://genius.com/Joy-division-love-will-tear-us-apart-pennine-version-lyrics
Song Description: An earlier version of Love Will Tear Us Apart, recorded at Pennine Studios in Oldham, this version was rejected due to frontman Ian Curtis and producer Martin Hannett being dissatisfied with the results. Consequently, the band re-recorded it at Strawberry Studios in Stockport, with the later version being the official one featured on the 7" release. However, the Pennine take didnt go to waste: it was ultimately included as a B-side on the songs 12" single release, alongside the 7" B-side These Days.

The style of the Pennine version is mostly similar to the Stockport one, but leans closer to the bands earlier live renditions of the song.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads

[Chorus]
Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

[Verse 2]
Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed? Our respect runs so dry
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives

[Chorus]
But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposed
And there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
Just that something so good, just can't function no more

Don't talk to me girl - you know it's not nice
Don't laugh at murder - I won't pay the price
The facts are too high-powered - it's such a big thrill
I'd do it myself, because it makes you so ill

You're such a chic tart - you're really dressed up
Don't wanna talk to you - just left with your mum

Don't be a puppet - always rush you around
One just for your photo - try and tie me down
I won't tell him I talk like this all night
He must be worried 'cause you're sounding so trite

[Verse 4]
Respect is only normal - the way to your lives
Ever tried to sleep around - once I begged for a wife
Wouldn't have to change you - start acting that way

Turn me on for good - it's so exciting
Slogans on the wall don't need no advertising
I can't even seem to find the room to move

Shackled up in fantasy
Hoping for some time to breathe
Suffocation comes too easy

I just want some time to breathe
Dirt sticks close to you - it's all around me
Everything I do - they're always trying to crowd me
I can't even seem to find the room to move
You might also likeWatching every move I make
Choice of one that's hard to take
In fact it's just a big mistake

The effects that make it feel like you

Maggots run inside the line
Ready for the perfect crime
Say there is no right or wrong

I don't know what's right or wrong
I don't know what's right or wrong
I don't know what's right or wrong
I don't know what's right or wrongEmbed

[Intro]
Radio, live transmission
Radio, live transmission

[Verse 1]
Listen to the silence, let it ring on
Eyes, dark grey lenses frightened of the sun
We would make a fine pair living in the night
Left to blind destruction - take away our sight

[Verse 2]
And we would go on as though nothing was wrong
And hide from the days to remain all alone
Stay in the same place, staring all the time
Touching from a distance, further all the time

[Chorus]
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio

[Verse 3]
Well I could call out when the going gets tough
And we could make contact if we trust our luck
No language, just sound, is all that I know
To synchronise love to the beat of the show
And we could dance

Lyrics:

Walk in silence
Don't walk away, in silence
See the danger
Always danger
Endless talking
Life rebuilding
Don't walk away

Walk in silence
Don't turn away, in silence
Your confusion
My illusion
Worn like a mask of self-hate
Confronts and then dies
Don't walk away

People like you find it easy
Always in tune - walking on air
They’re hunting in packs
By the rivers, through the streets
It may happen soon
Then maybe you’ll care
Walk away
Walk away from danger

I’m just crossing the line
Just crossing the line
Trying to get back
Right where I was
Back where I was
See me crossing the line
Don’t walk awayYou might also likeEmbed

Lyrics:

Don't speak of false Messiahs
A failure of the Modern Man
To the centre of all life's desires
As a whole not an also ran
Love in a hollow field
Break the image of your father's son
Drawn to an inner feel
He was thought of as the only one

He no longer denies
All the failures of the Modern Man
He no longer presides
Sees the failures of the Modern Man
Wise words and sympathy
Tell the story of our history
New strength gives a real touch
Sense and reason make it all too much
With a strange fatality
Broke the spirits of a lesser man
Some other race can see
In his way he was the only one

He no longer denies
All the failures of the Modern Man
No, no, he can't pick sides
Sees the failures of the Modern Man
Now that it's right to decide
In his time he was a total man
Taken from Caesar's side
Kept in silence just to prove who's wrong
No, no, he can't pick sides
All the failures of the Modern Man
No, no longer denies
Sees all the failures of the Modern ManYou might also likeEmbed

Lyrics:

[Intro]
This song's called "Disorder"

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand
Could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man?
Lose sensation, spare the insults leave them for another day
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away

[Verse 2]
It's getting faster, moving faster now, it's getting out of hand
On the tenth floor, down the back stairs it's a no man's land
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow

[Verse 3]
What means to you, what means to me and we will meet again
I'm watching you, I'm watching her, I take no pity from your friends
Who is right? Who can tell? And who gives a damn right now?
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow

[Outro]
I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling
But lose the feeling, but lose the feeling

To see in black and white and through to black again

When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads

Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

[Verse 2: Ian Curtis]
Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed? Our respect runs so dry
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives

[Chorus: Ian Curtis]
But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Ian Curtis]
You cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposed
Yes, it's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
Just that something so good, just can't function no more

She's lost control
And she gave away the secrets of her past
And said I've lost control again
And a voice that told her when and where to act
She said I've lost control again

[Verse 2]
And she turned around and took me by the hand and said
I've lost control again
And how I'll never know just why or understand
She said I've lost control again
And she screamed out kicking on her side and said
I've lost control again
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die
She said I've lost control

Too frail to wake this time

A cry for help, a hint of anaesthesia
The sound from broken homes, we used to always meet here
As he lays asleep, she takes him in her arms
Some things I have to do, but I don't mean you harm

A worried parent's glance, a kiss, a last goodbye
Hands him the bag she packed, the tears she tries to hide
A cruel wind that bows down to our lunacy
And leaves him standing cold here in this colony

I can't see why all these confrontations
I can't see why all these dislocations
No family life, this makes me feel uneasy
Stood alone here in this colony
In this colony

So this is permanence, love's shattered pride
What once was innocence, turned on its side
A cloud hangs over me, marks every move
Deep in the memory, of what once was love

[Verse 2]
Oh how I realised how I wanted time
Put into perspective, tried so hard to find
Just for one moment, thought I'd found my way
Moving on the main path, I watched it slip away

[Verse 3]
Excessive flash points, beyond all reach
Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep
Let's take a ride out, see what we can find
A valueless collection of hopes and desires

[Verse 4]
I never realised how I needed time
But if you were at the center, of another time
Just for one moment, thought I heard my name
Looked beyond beneath you, I wasn't squared away

[Verse 5]
Well now that I've realised how it's all gone wrong
Gotta find some therapy, this treatment takes too long
Deep in the heart of sympathy held sway

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Welcome to the atrocity exhibition

[Verse 1]
Asylums with doors open wide
Where people had paid to see inside
For entertainment they watch his body twist
Behind his eyes he says, "I exist"

[Chorus]
This is the way, step inside
This is the way, step inside
This is the way, step inside
This is the way, step inside

[Verse 2]
In arenas he kills for a prize
Wins a minute to add to his life
But the sickness is drowned by cries for more
Pray to God, makеs it quick

[Chorus]
This is the way, step inside
This is thе way, step inside
This is the way, step inside
This is the way, step inside

This is the way
This is the way
This is the way
Step inside
I step alone
This is the way
This is the way

[Chorus]
This is the way, step inside
This is the way, step inside
This is the way, step inside
This is the way, step inside

[Verse 3]
You see mass murder on a scale you've never seen
You see the ones who try hard to succeed
You meet the architects of law face to face
You see the horrors of a faraway place

[Chorus]
This is the way, step inside
This is the way, step inside
This is the way, step inside
This is the way, step inside
[Bridge 2]
This is the way
This is the way
This is the way
You think everything else belongs to you
We're all prostitutes
Who can build a new atrocity
Waking in a new atrocity
Waking up a new atrocity
So step inside
Step inside
Step inside
Step inside
Step inside

[Outro]
You wanna see some more? Step inside
You wanna see some more? Step inside
You wanna see some more? Step inside
You wanna see some more? Step insideEmbed

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
A legacy so far removed
One day will be improved
Eternal rights we left behind
We were the better kind

I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you

Our friendship never died
On stranger waves, the lows and highs
Our vision touched the sky

I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you

I put my trust in you

Someone take these dreams away
That point me to another day
A duel of personalities
That stretch all true realities

That keep calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me

When figures from the past stand tall
And mocking voices ring the hall
Imperialistic house of prayer
Conquistadors who took their share

That keep calling me

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
When you're looking at life
In a strange new room
Maybe drowning soon
Is this the start of it all?
Turn on your TV
Turn down your pulse
Turn away from it all
It's all getting too much

[Verse 2]
When you're looking at life
Deciphering scars
Just who fooled who
Sit still in their cars
The lights look bright
When you reach outside
Time for one last ride

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
To the center of the city where all roads meet, waiting for you
To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank searching for you
I was moving through the silence without motion waiting for you
In a room with a window in the corner, I found truth

[Verse 2]
In the shadowplay, acting out your own death knowing no more
As the assassins all grouped in four lines dancing on the floor
And with cold steel, odor on their bodies made a move to connect
But I could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all left

[Outro]
I did everything, everything I wanted to
I let thеm use you for their own ends
To thе center of the city in the night, waiting for you

When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow

[Chorus]
Then love, love will tear us apart again

[Verse 1]
See my true reflection cut off my own connections
I can see life getting harder
So sad is this sensation, reverse the situation
I can't see it getting better

[Verse 2]
I'll walk you through the heartbreak, show you all the outtakes
I can't see it getting higher
Systematically degraded, emotionally a scapegoat
I can't see it getting better

[Verse 3]
Perverse and unrealistic, try to make it all stick
I can't see it getting better
Hollow now, I'm burned out, all I need to break out
I can't see life getting higher

Lyrics:

Here are the young men, the weight on their shoulders
Here are the young men, well, where have they been?
We knocked on the doors of Hell's darker chamber
Pushed to the limit, we dragged ourselves in
Watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying
We saw ourselves now as we never had seen
Portrayal of the trauma and degeneration
The sorrows we suffered and never were free

Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?

Weary inside, now our heart's lost forever
Can't replace the fear, or the thrill of the chase
Each ritual showed up the door for our wanderings
Open then shut, then slammed in our face

Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?You might also likeEmbed

Lyrics:

A change of speed, a change of style
A change of scene, with no regrets
A chance to watch, admire the distance
Still occupied, though you forget
Different colours, different shades
Over each mistakes were made
I took the blame
Directionless so plain to see
A loaded gun won't set you free
So you say

We'll share a drink and step outside
An angry voice and one who cried
We'll give you everything and more
The strain's too much, can't take much more
Oh, I've walked on water, run through fire
Can't seem to feel it anymore
It was me, waiting for me
Hoping for something more
Me, seeing me this time
Hoping for something elseYou might also likeEmbed

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
This is a crisis I knew had to come
Destroying the balance I kept
Moving, unsettling, and turning around
Wondering what will come next
Is this the role that you wanted to live?
I was foolish to ask for so much
Without the protection and infancy's guard
It all falls apart at first touch

[Verse 2]
Watching the reel as it comes to a close
Brutally taking its time
People who change for no reason at all
It's happening all of the time
Can I go on with this chain of events?
Disturbing and purging my mind
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done
I know that I'll lose every time

[Verse 3]
Moving along in our God-given ways
Safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles
Left with a mark on the door
Is this the gift that I wanted to give?
Forgive and forgets what they teach
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more
And watch as they drown by the beach

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Procession moves on, the shouting is over
Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone
Sitting in sound as they sit 'round their table
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain
Wait by the gate at the foot of the garden
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment
Restrict by a fury that burns from inside

[Verse 2]
Cry like a child, though these years make me older
With children my time is so wastefully spent
A burden to keep, though their inner communion
Accept like a curse, an unlucky deal
Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden
My view stretches out from the fence to the wall
No words could describe, no actions determine
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fallYou might also likeEmbed
