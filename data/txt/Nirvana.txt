Artist: Nirvana
Artist Description: Nirvana was arguably the most successful act of the early 1990s grunge movement that originated in Seattle, Washington. Formed in 1987 in the neighboring city of Aberdeen, the group was catapulted into the spotlight four years later with the release of “Smells Like Teen Spirit” and their second studio album, September 1991’s Nevermind.

They are credited with bringing alternative rock to mainstream attention and putting a nail in the coffin of ‘80s hair metal, which was dying a slow death on the charts at that point. In early 1992, Nevermind managed to knock Michael Jackson’s Dangerous from the #1 position on the Billboard charts, cementing their place in American music history.

The final line-up of Nirvana consisted of legendary grunge vocalist Kurt Cobain, drummer Dave Grohl, and bassist Krist Novoselic.

The band’s career was suddenly cut short in April 1994, when vocalist Cobain was found dead from an apparent suicide. Drummer Dave Grohl has since become a hugely successful frontman in his own right with the band Foo Fighters. Nirvana has gone on to enjoy a musical afterlife in the hearts and ears of successive generations of fans, comparable to that of The Beatles and Black Sabbath.

Title: Smells Like Teen Spirit
Release Date: September 10, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-smells-like-teen-spirit-lyrics
Song Description: Considered by many to be the ultimate grunge anthem, Smells Like Teen Spirit was the lead single for Nirvanas second studio album and major label debut, September 1991s Nevermind. The songs success and omnipresence in the early 90s brought the band unrivaled popularity. Eventually, Kurt Cobain grew tired of it and removed it from their live set as often as possible.

Rock history recalls Kathleen Hanna from Bikini Kill scrawling the phrase Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit in spray paint on a wall, from which Kurt took the title. Some say Kurt took it as a call for a revolution, in reference to the Bikini Kill-led riot grrl movement; but according to producer Butch Vig, Kurt just thought the phrase was stupid, and it didnt really mean anything at all. However, it was later revealed that Hanna was referring to the brand of deodorant worn by Kurts then-girlfriend and Hannas then-bandmate Tobi Vail.

In a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone, Cobain said:

I was trying to write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it. When I heard [them] for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I should have been in that bandor at least in a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard.

It was one of the last tracks written and recorded for the album, and the final version is comprised of the second take out of just three takes, according to Montage of Heck and other sources.

Smells Like Teen Spirit was voted #9 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Title: Come as You Are
Release Date: September 24, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-come-as-you-are-lyrics
Song Description: Initially thought to have great crossover potential by their management, Come As You Are was intended be the main single on Nirvanas second album, Nevermind.   (Smells Like Teen Spirit was imagined as more for committed grunge fans.) However, the surprise success of Smells Like Teen Spirit, which came to be considered their signature song, made this plan inconsequential. Despite this overshadowing, the song had good commercial success, peaking at 32 on the Billboard and 9 on the UK singles charts.

The songs lyrics appear to have a foreshadowing tone given Cobains death by self-inflicted gunshot wound. However, in the context of the song they seem to be an ironic comment about peoples bad intentions.

Kurt Cobain spoke about the lyrics on Nevermind: Its An Interview:

The lines in the song are really contradictory. One after another they are kind of a rebuttal to each line. Its kind of confusing I guess. Its just about people and what they are expected to act like.

The songs distinctive guitar riff was heavily borrowed from Killing Jokes song Eighties, a fact that made the band hesitate to release the song as a single. Nirvana manager Danny Goldberg told Rolling Stone:

Kurt was nervous about Come as You Are because it was too similar to a Killing Joke song Eighties, but we all thought it was still the better song to go with. And, he was right, Killing Joke later did complain about it.

Despite their complaints, Killing Joke never filed suit against Nirvana.

The song also includes a rare extended guitar solo for Cobain, whose immersion in stripped-down punk aesthetics meant he didnt often engage in musical self-indulgence. Producer Butch Vig recalled:

Kurt really did not play a lot of solos. This one is more of a melodic part based on the vocal melody. Its not trying to show off pyrotechnics. It complements the melody of the song.

In Aberdeen, Washington, which is the birthplace of Cobain, he is commemorated by a sign which says Come as you are:
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend

Title: Heart-Shaped Box
Release Date: August 30, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-heart-shaped-box-lyrics
Song Description: The first single from In Utero, Heart-Shaped Box details the battle of wills inherent to a new relationship when one doesnt quite feel so strongly about another person.

Heart-Shaped Box received critical acclaim during radio airplay and reached number 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts.

The music video was directed by Anton Corbijn and it was conceptualized by Kurt. During the songs first verse, the old man from the hospital climbs onto a crow-ridden Christian cross. The second verse introduces a young girl in a white robe and peaked cap reaching for human fetuses in a tree, and an overweight woman in a suit with human organs painted onto it and with angel wings affixed to her back.

While most of the video was devised by Cobain, Corbijn added elements such as the intentionally artificial crows, a ladder for the old man to climb onto the cross with, and a box with a heart at the top that the band performs inside of during the songs final chorus.

Title: Lithium
Release Date: September 24, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-lithium-lyrics
Song Description: Lithium is a perfect description of manic depression, where every line is both happy and sad, up and down, while having references to God recalling when Kurt lived with a devout Christian family. The title invokes lithium salts, a key drug in treating the disorder.

The CD single contained a sonogram photo of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Loves still to be born child, Frances Bean; Kurt said he thought he saw Frances doing the heavy metal devil horn hand gesture when he watched the sonogram.
Lyrics:

Title: Drain You
Release Date: September 24, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-drain-you-lyrics
Song Description: According to Kurt, this song was written about a dorky, old-fashioned kind of love. One of his favorite tracks, it was performed in most concerts ever since its composition up until Nirvanas breakup.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to've met you"
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection

[Chorus]
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

[Verse 2]
With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
You taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids

Pass it back and forth

Title: Polly
Release Date: September 24, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-polly-lyrics
Song Description: This song is about the actual kidnapping of a 14-year-old girl. In 1987, she was returning from a concert in Tacoma, Washington when she was abducted by a man named Gerald Friend. He took her back to his mobile home and raped her. The girl, whose name was not released, was tortured with a whip, a razor, and a blowtorch. She managed to escape when Friend took her for a ride and stopped for gas. He was arrested and sent to jail.

Nirvana played some benefits to help rape victims, including the Rock Against Rape concert in 1993, which raised money for a womens self-defense organization.

This was the only song on Nevermind remaining from the Smart Studios session in Madison, Wisconsin on April 2-6 of 1990. As such, it is the only song on Nevermind to feature Chad Channing on drums.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blowtorch

[Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

[Verse 2]
Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
She asked me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

[Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told

Title: Something in the Way
Release Date: September 24, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-something-in-the-way-lyrics
Song Description: Something in the Way is the twelfth and final song on Nirvanas major label debut, Nevermindnot including its hidden track, Endless, Nameless. While many fans believed that the lyrics were auto-biographical, concerning a stint of vagrancy in Kurt Cobains life, this common misconception has been refuted by several sources. According to Michael Azerrads September 1993 biography, Come As You Are, Cobain said the concept was supposed to be:

like if I was living under the bridge and I was dying of A.I.D.S., if I was sick and I couldnt move and I was a total street person. That was kind of the fantasy of it.

Nonetheless, historians seem to agree that it was the Young Street Bridge which inspired this haunting composition, as Kurt would often hang out nearby and fish along the famous Wishkah River when he was a teenager. This location has become a sort of memorial for Nirvana fans and is commonly decorated with tributes to the late singer.

https://youtu.be/APHX-9ZQ7x0

According to an iconic January 2005 episode of VH1 Classic Albums, producer Butch Vig recalled a frustrated Cobain giving up on the original recording process due to the bands inability to realize his vision. He and Vig entered the control room with a 12-string acoustic guitar and Kurt laid down on his back to demonstrate how it should sound. Vig scrambled to turn off all the buzzing electronics surrounding them and set up microphones in order to capture the moment. The subsequent overdubbing process was quite arduous, as there was no click-track and Cobains vocals came in at almost a whisper.

More than twenty years later, Rolling Stone would place Something In The Way at #5 on their definitive ranking of every Nirvana song.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Underneath the bridge, tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped have all become my pets
And I'm livin' off of grass and the drippings from the ceilin'
It's okay to eat fish 'cause they don't have any feelings

Song Description: Cobains lyrics poke fun at the people outside of the underground music scene that began showing up at Nirvana shows after the release of the groups debut album, Bleach.

Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad wrote, But remarkably, [the songs lyrics] translated even better to the mass popularity the band enjoyed. Regarding the songs chorus, Azerrad commented, The brilliant irony is that the tune is so catchy that millions of people actually do sing along to it.

Title: Rape Me
Release Date: September 13, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-rape-me-lyrics
Song Description: Originally written in May 1991 and performed live later that year, Rape Me was recorded in a studio setting in February 1993. It was released on the bands final studio album, September 1993s In Utero.

Kurt Cobain wanted to make a strong statement in support of women and against violence. Cobain and Love played a number of charity concerts specifically oriented around raising money for rape victims or to raise awareness about the prevalence of rape. It was an important issue to them. Frustrated by the fact that many people didnt grasp how September 1991s Polly was actually an anti-rape song, Cobain decided to be more explicit. Cobain was ultimately forced to explicate and clarify his songs' significance several times to magazine reporters and columnists, culminating in a notable 1993 cover story by SPIN.

Lyrically, the song concerns poetic justice: a guy rapes a girl; he ends up in jail and is raped there, in turn. The favorite in-side source line supports that this song could be about how the media had forcibly penetrated Cobains private life and further distorted his messages. Unlike the rest of the song, the bridge was written post-Nevermind, and could reflect recently-emerged sentiments Cobain had developed toward media attention. Cobain initially denied the premise that this song has a dual meaning during interviews and other public appearances. In a discussion with Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad, Cobain conceded a bit:

It was actually about rape but now I could definitely use it as an example of my life for the past six months or year, easily.

The double A-side single featuring Rape Me and All Apologies was retitled Waif Me for sale in Wal-Mart and Kmart stores, but without any lyrical modifications. Cobain defended this censoring by stating:

One of the main reasons I signed to a major label was so people would be able to buy our records at Kmart. In some towns, thats the only place kids can buy records.

Song Description: A song originally by David Bowie that Kurt Cobain and Nirvana played at their famous MTV Unplugged show. The songs subject is a man who feels as though he sold out his identity, a metaphor for the world of his youth. Kurt Cobain felt the same way at this time in his career and did everything in his power to distance himself from Nirvanas incredible fame.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]

We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago

[Chorus]
Oh, no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand

For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
We walked a million hills

Title: About a Girl
Release Date: June 15, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-about-a-girl-lyrics
Song Description: According to Chad Channing, Nirvanas drummer around the time of Bleach, Cobain didnt have a title for the song when he first brought it into the studio. When asked what it was about, Cobain replied, Its about a girl.

The girl in question was Tracy Marander, Cobains then-girlfriend, with whom he lived at the time. Apparently, Marander had asked Cobain why he had never written a song for her, and Cobain responded with About a Girl. The song addresses the couples fractured relationship, caused by Cobains refusal to get a job, or to share cleaning duties at their apartment (which housed many of his pets). During arguments on the subject, Cobain would occasionally threaten to move into his car, at which point Marander would usually relent.

Cobain never told Marander that he had written About a Girl for her. In the 1998 Nick Broomfield documentary Kurt and Courtney, Marander revealed that she only found out after reading Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana.

Kurt Cobain wrote this after spending the previous night listening to The Beatles first US album, Meet The Beatles, over and over.

Nirvana opened their MTV Unplugged in NY session with this song:

Title: Lounge Act
Release Date: September 24, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-lounge-act-lyrics
Song Description: This song is about Bikini Kills Tobi Vail, Kurts girlfriend for most of the time he wrote Nevermind. The musical backing, that even starts with a  Krist Novoselics bass solo, was likened to him and Kurt to lounge music, and thus came this title.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Tradin' off and takin' turns
I don't regret a thing

[Chorus]
And I've got this friend, you see, who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowin' fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fightin' jealousy
Until it's fucking gone

[Chorus]
I've got this friend, you see, who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still

Title: Territorial Pissings
Release Date: September 24, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-territorial-pissings-lyrics
Song Description: Territorial Pissings was inspired by Kurt Cobains observations of the mistreatment of both Native Americans and of women. He explained the song title as:

In the animal kingdom, the male will often piss in certain areas to claim his territory, and I see macho men reacting towards sex and power in the same way. Id like to see these lost souls strung up by their balls with pages of SCUM Manifesto stapled to their bodies.

When Nirvana appeared on the British TV show Tonight With Jonathan Ross and were told to play Lithium, instead they played this song before smashing their equipment and leaving the stage. Boss.

Title: Where Did You Sleep Last Night? (Live Acoustic)
Release Date: November 1, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-where-did-you-sleep-last-night-live-acoustic-lyrics
Song Description: This is a cover of In The Pines by American folk and blues singer, songwriter and guitar virtuoso Lead Belly, who Kurt Cobain describes as his favorite performer while introducing the song.

As the closing track of Nirvanas Unplugged in New York album and televised concert, it is the last song on the last album Cobain recorded before his death.
Lyrics:

[Spoken Intro: Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic]
Fuck you all, this is the last song of the evening
What is it?
This was written by (Uh, what?) my favorite performer. Our favorite performer, isn't it? All of ours? You like him the best?
Oh! And there's a donation basket. Kurt wants to buy Lead Belly's guitar
Oh yeah, this guy representing the Lead Belly estate wants to sell me Lead Belly's guitar for five hundred thousand dollars
We're passing a basket if anyone-
Yeah, I even asked David Ges— Geffen personally if he'd buy it for me and he wouldn't do it. Okay

[Verse 1]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 2]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 3]
Her husband was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found

Title: Dumb
Release Date: September 21, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-dumb-lyrics
Song Description: Melody Maker, in their August 21, 1993 interview with Kurt Cobain, explained:


The lyric for Dumb seems peculiarly direct, a song about lifes simple, silly little pleasures. Like I think Im dumb/Or maybe just happy. Is it intended to reflect that new-found optimism youve mentioned, or should we be reading it ironically?

Cobain: Thats just about people whore easily amused, people who not only arent capable of progressing their intelligence but are totally happy watching 10 hours of television and really enjoy it. Ive met a lot of dumb people. They have a shitty job, they may be totally lonely, they dont have a girlfriend, they dont have much of a social life, and yet, for some reason, theyre happy.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'm not like them, but I can pretend
The sun is gone, but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm havin' fun
I think I'm dumb
[Chorus 1]
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy

[Verse 2]
My heart is broke, but I have some glue
Help me inhale and mend it with you
We'll float around and hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down
[Chorus 2]
And have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover

Title: Breed
Release Date: September 24, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-breed-lyrics
Song Description: Kurt Cobain originally titled Breed as Imodium after Tad Doyles diarrhea medicine to suggest the running on of the mouth.

The track was likely inspired by Kurts breakup with Tobi Vail. He personally described Breed as:

Getting into Middle America. Marrying at age 18, getting pregnant, stuck with a baby  and not wanting it.
Lyrics:

Title: Pennyroyal Tea
Release Date: September 21, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-pennyroyal-tea-lyrics
Song Description: Pennyroyal Tea was due to be released as the third single from In Utero in April 1994.  However, after the death of Cobain in the same month, the planned release was abandoned. The song did get plenty of airtime on MTV, however, and a lot of attention due to Cobains solo rendition on  Unplugged in New York.

According to Michael Azerrads 1993 Nirvana biography, Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana, Pennyroyal Tea was written by Cobain in 1990 in an Olympia, Washington apartment he shared with drummer Dave Grohl. Dave and I were screwing around on a 4-track, said Cobain, and I wrote that song in about thirty seconds. And I sat down for like half-an-hour and wrote the lyrics and then we recorded it. The band played the song live many times in 1991 and 1992. However, it didnt receive studio treatment until 1993, when it was recorded by Steve Albini for In Utero.

A remix by Scott Litt appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions; this remix is also available on the bands 2002 best-of compilation, Nirvana, and is, incidentally, the same mix that was to appear on the single.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture

[Chorus]
Sit and drink pennyroyal tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink pennyroyal tea
I'm anemic royalty

[Verse 2]
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally

[Chorus]
I'm so tired, I can't sleep
I'm a liar and a thief
Sit and drink pennyroyal tea
I'm anemic royalty

Title: You Know You’re Right
Release Date: October 29, 2002, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-you-know-youre-right-lyrics
Song Description: You Know Youre Right, recorded in January of 1994, was the last song Nirvana finished as a group.
 Kurt was days late to the studio, arriving on the third day of a three day booking. Dave and Krist decided to jam before he got there, those jams made up the rest of the tape that the song was featured on.

The song remained unheard until 2002 when it was released as a single, and subsequently on a Nirvana greatest hits compilation. It was, however, featured on many live bootleg recordings from shows that took place in the final years of Kurt Cobains life. The song was thought to have been called either Autopilot, On a Mountain, or Youve Got No Rights (the title of the version Cobains widow, Courtney Love sang during Holes MTV Unplugged).
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
And always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
You know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right

[Verse 2]
I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let's talk about someone else
Steaming soup against her mouth
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love himself
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear

Always knew it'd come to this

Title: Serve the Servants
Release Date: September 21, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-serve-the-servants-lyrics
Song Description: In Uteros opening track is a message to Kurts father, whom he did not have a good relationship with.

Initially, this song was about coming of age during a time where youre old enough to support yourself without the aid of your parents, a theme for the twenty-somethings. Ive always felt that a person doesnt necessarily have to force themselves to love their parents simply because of blood. If you dont like your parents or relatives, dont fake it. Tell them how you feel and in my own way, I decided to let my father know that I dont hate him. I simply dont have anything to say and I dont need a father-son relationship with a person whom I dont want to spend a boring Christmas with. In other words, I love you. I dont hate you. I dont want to talk to you.
-excerpt from Kurt Cobains Journals (222)
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Teenage angst has paid off well
Now I'm bored and old
Self-appointed judges judge
More than they have sold
If she floats then she is not
A witch like we've thought
A down payment on another
One at Salem's lot

[Chorus]
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants
That legendary divorce is such a bore

[Verse 2]
As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a father
But instead, I had a dad
I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore

Song Description: On APlain is asong about writing song. Kurt Cobain explores a variety of songwriting topics, such as writers block and the search for ones own voice. He ultimately opts for simplicity, declaring that he is On a plain (at a high point in life) and that he Cant complain.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'll start this off without any words
I got so high, I scratched 'til I bled
Love myself better than you

Was when I learned to cry on command
Love myself better than you

Title: Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle
Release Date: September 21, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-frances-farmer-will-have-her-revenge-on-seattle-lyrics
Song Description: This song was inspired by Seattle-native Frances Farmer, an actor who was persecuted by the media due to her increasingly erratic behavior. She was later diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Kurt Cobain became fascinated with her after reading the 1978 biography Shadowland in high school.



Kurt and Courtney Loves daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, is commonly thought to have been named after Farmer; however, it is well-established that she was actually named after Frances McKee from The Vaselines. Additionally, Courtney reportedly wore one of Farmers old dresses at the couples February 1992 wedding in Hawaii. It was said to have dry rot on it.
Lyrics:

Title: Stay Away
Release Date: September 24, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-stay-away-lyrics
Song Description: Stay Away is the 10th track on the alternative rock (grunge) band Nirvanas 1991 second studio album, Nevermind.

Nevermind popularized the Seattle grunge movement and brought alternative rock as a whole into the mainstream, establishing its commercial and cultural viability. Its success surprised Nirvanas contemporaries, who felt dwarfed by its impact. Fugazi frontman Guy Picciotto later said: It was like our record could have been a hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had  It felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did.
This breakthrough album announced a new musical style (grunge) and gave a voice to the post-baby boom young adults known as Generation X.

Dave Grohl, the second drummer of Nirvana, has said that Cobain told him, Music comes first and lyrics come second, and Grohl believes that above all Cobain focused on the melodies of his songs. Cobain was still working on the albums lyrics well into the recording of Nevermind. Additionally, Cobains phrasing on the album is often difficult to understand. Bryan David Butch Vig is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer, who worked on Nevermind as well, asserted that clarity of Cobains singing was not paramount. Vig said, Even though you couldnt quite tell what he was singing about, you knew it was intense as hell. Cobain would later complain when rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing and extract meaning from his lyrics, writing Why in the hell do journalists insist on coming up with a second-rate Freudian evaluation of my lyrics, when 90 percent of the time theyve transcribed them incorrectly?

Title: Milk It
Release Date: September 21, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-milk-it-lyrics
Song Description: Milk it is on Nirvanas third studio album titled In Utero. The In Utero album was Released on September 13, 1993 and would become Nirvanas final studio album after the suicide/death of lead singer Kurt Cobain on April 5, 1994.

Milk it musical style could be described as very quiet verses accompanied by a very loud chorus.

The lyrics written by Kurt Cobain contained depressing imagery that discussed Kurt Cobains frustration with fame & drug addiction. The lyrics also contain some of Kurt Cobains suicidal thoughts.

Cobain cited the track Milk It as an example of the more experimental and aggressive direction the bands music had been moving in the months prior to the sessions at Pachyderm Studio. (Azerrad, 1994. p. 323)

Cobain stated in a 1993 interview with The Observer that "for the most part [In Utero]s very impersonal. (Savage, Jon. Sounds Dirty: The Truth About Nirvana. The Observer. August 15, 1993.)

Title: Sliver
Release Date: December 14, 1992, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-sliver-lyrics
Song Description: Sliver is about a child whose parents are going to a show, so they drop him off at his grandparents' house. It features drummer Dan Peters of Mudhoney, while the music video, filmed years later, has Dave Grohl behind the drums.

Sliver was recorded on July 11, 1990, and Grohl joined Nirvana two months later.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
When Mom and Dad went to a show
They dropped me off at grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed; said, "Please, don't go!"

[Chorus]
Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!
Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!
Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!
Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!

[Verse 2]
Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatoes and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good

Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!
Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!
Grandma, take me home! Grandma, take me home!

Go outside and ride your bike"

Title: Scentless Apprentice
Release Date: September 21, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-scentless-apprentice-lyrics
Song Description: Kurt Cobain was inspired to write this song after reading the novel Perfume, one of his favorite books. The song mainly describes Jean, the main character of the book.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Like most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice

[Chorus]
Hey, away!
Go away!
Go away!

[Verse 2]
Every wet nurse refused to feed him
Electrolytes smell like semen
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers

Hey, away!

Title: I Hate Myself and Want to Die
Release Date: November 23, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-i-hate-myself-and-want-to-die-lyrics
Song Description: The original name for In Utero was in fact I Hate Myself and Want to Die, which was Kurts typical response to those asking him, How are you? However, before the release, Cobain changed his mind because he figured the title would be misunderstood.

Although I Hate Myself And Want To Die would posthumously be cited as a cry for help, Kurt assured us at the time that it was not meant to be taken literally  as literal as a joke can be, he said firmly. But even as he stresses this in an interview with Rolling Stones David Fricke, which appears in Brett Morgens Montage of Heck (2015), his tone seems to foreshadow the tragedy.

An early version was released on With The Lights Out in 2004.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Dave Grohl & Kurt Cobain]
So this po… This porno movie, porno movie called You've Said A Mouthful, and this guy has a hand shoved up his ass, and this lady shoving it up his ass, and he's going, "Owowowowow, don't take it out of me, ow, owowowow!"

Title: Blew
Release Date: June 15, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-blew-lyrics
Song Description: Blew is the first ever original single released by the hit grunge band, Nirvana. The song was written and recorded in 1988 and was often performed live. It quickly became a staple of the live setlist throughout Nirvanas short-lived lifespan.

Throughout the song, Kurt Cobain talks about not living up to his full potential despite being given the ability to do it. Blew is more like a realization of the fact that you can be something greater, but choose not to go down that path.

During the recording of the song, both Kurt and Krist tuned their instruments down, forgetting that they had already done that. This led to the song being presented in a Drop C tuning, which is the explanation for the extremely heavy yet perfect sound.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to lose
And if you wouldn't care I would like to leave
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to breathe

[Chorus]
Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame

[Verse]
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
And if you wouldn't mind I would like to lose

Title: Lake of Fire (Live Acoustic)
Release Date: November 1, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-lake-of-fire-live-acoustic-lyrics
Song Description: A song originally written and performed by the Meat Puppets. Nirvana covered it during their 1994 MTV Unplugged in New York with Meat Puppets members Curt Kirkwood and Cris Kirkwood on guitar and bass, respectively.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

[Verse 1]
I knew a lady who came from Duluth
Bitten by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
Flew away howling on the yellow moon

[Chorus]
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

[Verse 2]
People cry and people moan
Look for a dry place to call their home
Try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own

[Chorus]
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July

Title: Endless, Nameless
Release Date: September 24, 1991, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-endless-nameless-lyrics
Song Description: This song was a random jam that broke out when they were trying to record Lithium. Kurt was so frustrated with their lack of progress that he spontaneously started playing this song and Krist and Dave joined in. The lyrics were made up on the fly.

Endless, Nameless appeared as a B-side to the Come as You Are single. On most pressings, the song was also included on the 1991 album Nevermind as a hidden track, following ten minutes of silence after Something in the Way ends.

Kurt broke his guitar in the studio during the recording, which can be heard during the end of the song. He also smashes his guitar after performing this song Live at the Paramount.

An extended jam that often closed concerts, the band recorded the track after the session for Lithium went south, [when Kurt] brought said session to a close by smashing the studios only left-handed guitar in the middle of the take.

Title: Floyd the Barber
Release Date: June 15, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-floyd-the-barber-lyrics
Song Description: The title and lyrics of this song were inspired by the 1960s television program, The Andy Griffith Show. Floyd, Barney, Opie and Aunt Bee were characters in the portrayal of a small, idyllic American town called Maybury.



Cobain used the shows innocent setting to tell a twisted story of going to the barber for a shave, only to end up being held captive, then tortured, raped, and murdered by the locals. Using this platform, he makes a philosophical point, describing how people of the time whitewashed their 50s upbringing to the point of refusing to acknowledge real social issues of the time.

Strangely enough, according to NME, police reports implied that when Cobains body was found, a nearby television was tuned to a station that aired syndicated re-runs of The Andy Griffith Show. It may have been one of the last images he saw.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Bell on door clank, come on in
Floyd observes my hairy chin
Sit down chair, don't be afraid
Steamed hot towel on my face

[Chorus]
I was shaved
I was shaved
I was shaved

[Verse 2]
Barney ties me to the chair
I can't see, I'm really scared
Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip
Pee-pee pressed against my lips

[Chorus]
I was shamed
I was shamed
I was shamed
[Guitar Solo]
Uh, uh

[Verse 3]
I sense others in the room
Opie, Aunt Bee, I presume
They take turns and cut me up
I died smothered in Andy's butt

Title: School
Release Date: June 15, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-school-lyrics
Song Description: The fourth track on Nirvanas debut album Bleach, School masterfully infuses simplistic yet all-telling and somewhat indulgent lyrics and a hard hitting riff with an unmistakable intro, one that has become a staple of fans' memories throughout the years.

Cobain himself described the song as representing the Seattle grunge scene parallel to the cliques and featured groups at high school. Towards the end of the bands 1989 Europe tour, he was noted as having to look out in the audience and all he could see were the kind of people who used to beat him up at school, which progressively lead to future tracks directed towards this fanbase, the most notable being In Bloom on Nevermind.

It was often requested at concerts throughout the bands entire inception life, and included on home video releases such Live at the Paramount, Live at Reading, and (more recently) Live and Loud, in addition to the twentieth anniversary reissue of Bleach, orchestrated by Geffen, that included the Pine Street Theater live version.
Lyrics:

Title: Plateau (Live Acoustic)
Release Date: November 1, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-plateau-live-acoustic-lyrics
Song Description: Originally a song by the Meat Puppets found on their sophomore album Meat Puppets II, Nirvana performed it on November 18th, 1993 on their album MTV Unplugged in New York. The Meat Puppets appeared with them to supply the backing instrumentation for Nirvanas acoustic version, having reportedly become close friends while on tour with one another.



The song appears as the first of three Meat Puppets songs included in the setlist, its siblings being covers of Oh Me ( original here ) and Lake of Fire ( original here ). It is one of six total covers on the album  nearly half their total performance time, as this Billboard review remarks  in a move rather strange for a taped music recording for any band that might not have the anti-establishment leanings of Nirvana.

The playing of these songs was not just a simple rage against the machine, however  it seemed that the three members of Nirvana had a strong affinity for the Meat Puppets' music. In the words of former Meat Puppets frontman Curt Kirkwood:

Later I had a band with (bassist) Krist (Novoselic) in the early 2000s called Eyes Adrift and I spent a lot of time up at his place out in Washington He would tell me that was just one of their favorite albums when they were younger before they were getting the band started Those are pretty much the songs off of the record Meat Puppets II.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau
Some belong to strangers, and some to folks you know
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
To beautify the foothills, and shake the many hands

[Chorus]
Nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words

[Verse 2]
When you've finished with the mop, then you can stop
And look at what you've done
The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen
And the work, it was fun

[Chorus]
Nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words

[Verse 3]
Many hands began to scan around for the next plateau
Some say it was Greenland, and some say Mexico
Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood
But those were all just guesses, wouldn't help you if they could

Title: Moist Vagina
Release Date: December 6, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-moist-vagina-lyrics
Song Description: Moist Vagina by Nirvana was recorded for the In Utero Album. It was recorded in 1993 by Steve Albini and under the label of DGC Records.

Moist Vagina is believed to be about the consumption of Marijuana, and not about going down on the girl you met at that house party a few hours ago. Lines like I particularly enjoyed the Circumference talking about the circumference, or half the diameter, of a Marijuana joint.

This song is known as one of Nirvanas more angrier songs. As you can hear in Kurts voice during the chorus, And for lack of a better phrase, The psychotic episode that is the guitar solo.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]

Song Description: Charles R. Cross recalled the following in his 2001 Kurt Cobain biography, titled Heavier Than Heaven:

Prior to entering the studio, Kurt had a list of eighteen songs he was considering; twelve from the list would ultimately end up on the finished album, but with their titles shifted considerably. The song that eventually was called Radio Friendly Unit Shifter started life as Nine Month Media Blackout, Kurts not-so-veiled response to the Vanity Fair piece. All Apologies was originally titled La, La, LaLa while Moist Vagina, a B-side, began with a far longer and more descriptive name: Moist vagina, and then she blew him like hes never been blown, brains stuck all over the wall.

Song Description: A recording for Nirvanas MTV Unplugged performance in 1993, this track was originally written by the Vaselines as a cynical twist on an older Christian hymn Jesus wants me for a sunbeam.

Along with Mollys Lips and Son of a Gun this marks the 3rd Vaselines song Nirvana covered.

At this performance, Cobain dedicated this song as to the late River Phoenix, who passed away from a drug overdose in 1993.

Title: ​Tourette’s
Release Date: September 21, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-tourettes-lyrics
Song Description: tourettes is the eleventh and penultimate song on Nirvanas final studio album, In Utero. Unlike the other songs on the album, the title of the song is not capitalized.

The song is named after Tourette Syndrome, a disorder that causes unwanted tics. These tics may be physical, like twitching or blinking, or verbal, like short shouts or uncontrollable cursing.

The track, reminiscent of hardcore punk, is a short, fast-paced screech. Kurt Cobains vocals are nearly unintelligible throughout the song. The booklet that came with CD copies of In Utero features lyrics for every song on the album except tourettes.

The lyrics printed for the song are simply cufk, tish, sips (anagrams of the curse words fuck, shit, and piss). However, in Nirvanas official biography, Come As You Are by Michael Azerad, Cobain said I didnt make any sentences or words, I just screamed.

Since the true lyrics to the song (if there are any) have never been confirmed, the lyrics on this page should be taken as an approximation.
Lyrics:

Title: Love Buzz
Release Date: November 1988, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-love-buzz-lyrics
Song Description: A cover of a song originally written by Robby Van Leeuwen from the Dutch band Shocking Blue, the song appeared on their 1969 sophomore LP Sensational.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAvYUFcRnO4

While Kurt Cobain would have preferred an original song as the bands first offering, he eventually came around to the idea. It was bassist Krist Novoselic who convinced Kurt to cover the song and the song ended up being NIRVANAs very first single  backed with Big Cheese. The original 7" version of the song was mixed with 10 seconds of a Kurt Cobain mash-up entitled Montage of Heck  an experimental recording dubbed over on a tape recorder.





First performed in Washington in early 1987 and first recorded in mid-1988 at Reciprocal in Seattle with producer Jack Endino who recorded all of their debut album Bleach at many sessions around this time. The last performance of the song was in 1993 at a benefit for rape victims.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US4zgrgaTYI

Cobain would later criticize Love Buzz as sounding too lightweight: We just couldnt get a good sound out of it, he told NIRVANA biographer, Michael Azerrad. It sounded really clean and just didnt have any low end. I think its the wimpiest recording weve ever done.
Lyrics:

Title: Sappy
Release Date: October 26, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-sappy-lyrics
Song Description: Sappy appears to be a feminist song criticizing traditional gender roles in romantic heterosexual relationships. Some fans claim it is about a turtle as Kurt Cobains pet tortoise was named Sappy. The title is a combination of the words sad and happy.

Despite recording Sappy a number of times between 1987 and 1993, Kurt Cobain was never satisfied with the outcomes. The last recording of it was finally released in October 1993 as a hidden track on the AIDS-benefit compilation No Alternative under the title Verse Chorus Verse. But to avoid confusion with another Nirvana song titled Verse Chorus Verse, this one is often referred to by its original working title Sappy instead.

In 2013, a newer remix of Sappy was added to the 20th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition of Nirvanas In Utero album. That same year, a Rolling Stone readers poll ranked Sappy as the #9 best Nirvana song of all time.

Title: Negative Creep
Release Date: June 15, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-negative-creep-lyrics
Song Description: Described by IGN as being a textbook example of Seattles true grunge sound, Negative Creep exemplifies Kurts antisocial themes in songs, as this is written from the first person view of himself by his own perception.

This is a rather standout track on both Bleach and in Nirvanas catalog, as it predominantly has  the screeching and high-pitched wails of Cobain over the slick, yet rugged, riff coursing throughout the song, complete with the lyrics to puzzle the whole unsung masterpiece, as some would define it.

Negative Creep, like other Bleach tracks, was played throughout Nirvanas concerts well into the abrupt end, though to a lesser extent than others. Most notably, it was featured in the Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!, Live at the Paramount (this version was included on the compilation Live  from the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah album), and Live at Reading CD/video releases.

Title: Paper Cuts
Release Date: June 15, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-paper-cuts-lyrics
Song Description: This is track number six on Bleach. Paper Cuts is arguably the most intense song on the album, with jarring rhythms and screeching vocals.

The song depicts a child growing up in a house which has black windows. According to liveNIRVANA.coms archives, the song is about an abused boy trapped in the basement of their parents house:

This kid came from a family who tortured their children, and kept them all in one room with black-painted windows and a pile of newspapers for [a] toilet. The authorities later found out and took the kids away. The lyrics also seem to contain elements from Kurts relationship with his mother.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
At my feeding time
She'd push food through the door
I crawl towards the cracks of light
Sometimes I can't find my way
Newspapers spread around
Soaking all that they can
A cleaning is due again
A good hosing down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The lady whom I feel maternal love for
Cannot look me in the eyes
But I see hers and they are blue
And they cock and twitch and masturbate

[Chorus 1]
Why?
I said so

Title: Downer
Release Date: June 15, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-downer-lyrics
Song Description: Kurt said about this song:

I was trying to be Mr. Black Flag punk-rock guy I didnt know what I was talking about.

Downer is actually the only song to emerge from his Fecal Matter demo to an official Nirvana album, twice. Once on Bleach and the second time on Incesticide. The Bleach one was recorded by Kurt on guitar and vocals and Dale Crover (Melvins) on drums and bass. Crover later re-recorded the drums, and thats the version that ended up on Incesticide. The song is a remnant of Kurts immersion in hardcore punk and his pre-Nirvana, 1985 Fecal Matter days.

Lyrics from Kurts notebook:
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Portray sincerity
Act out of loyalty
Defend your free country
Wish away, pain
Hand out lobotomies
To save little families
Surrealistic fantasy
Bland, boring, plain!

Holy now is restitution
Living out your date of fusion

Title: Swap Meet
Release Date: June 15, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-swap-meet-lyrics
Song Description: Swap Meet is the ninth track on Bleach, written circa 1988, according to liveNIRVANA.coms archives.

In 2019, Rolling Stone published its definitive ranking of every Nirvana song, placing Swap Meet at #51:

This Bleach track is one of the most tempestuous and restless in Nirvanas catalogue. The guitar playing is as anxious as sweaty hands, and Chad Channings drums race ahead of the action like hes late for a meeting. The feeling fits the content, in which Cobain sets the scene of two hometown losers too busy exchanging arts and crafts to shut up and have sex already. Cobain wasnt known as a storyteller, but he was known as a Seattle thrift-store fiend [] This caustic snapshot of life back home, then, works like a snapshot jotted down from one such swap meet, the outsider judging the insiders from the periphery. As Nirvanas reputation grew, this small-town send-up seemed to fall out of favor, with the band playing it less than almost any song released on an official studio album. Too bad: Its a musical fistfight.

Grayson Haver Currin
Lyrics:

[Verse]
They live a lifestyle that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make a living off of arts and crafts
The kind with seashells, driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they would come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battleground
She loves him more than he will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show

[Chorus]
Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart

Title: Been a Son
Release Date: December 14, 1992, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-been-a-son-lyrics
Song Description: This song is basically about sexism against women.
Been A Son is a feminist song, pointing out sexism against humans for simply being born female, making us want to stop the medieval opinion that being female automatically makes you less valuable than a male. In this song, it is sung about a girl (that represents all women who have been discriminated against for being a girl) that has to endure her fathers (the father represents the  misogynistic and sexist part of society) hate for her for simply not being born a son.



Been a Son was recorded in September of 1989 for the Blew EP.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
She should have stayed away from friends
She should have had more time to spend
She should have died when she was born
She should have worn the crown of thorns

[Chorus]
She should have been a son
She should have been a son

Song Description: Gallons of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through the Strip is a demo recorded during a January 1993 jam session while on tour in Brazil. It is a hidden track on non-American pressings of In Utero that appears twenty minutes after the end of All Apologies. The song is unfinished and features improvised lyrics by Cobain dealing mostly with his heroin addiction.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It hurts when you have to press that dull little thing
That you're only supposed to use once and then discard
Where do you put it? In the garbage can, my honest friend
My shyness, pet her flow

She's only been five months late
Even though we haven't had sex for a week
A meal a day, a meal, I say
And my heart's made, my—

[Verse 2]
Somebody else already used the word 'aurora borealis'
She was tied up in chains, and Sam had helped her in the freezer

But I haven't had a date forever

More opportunity
More chances to remember some things

And his silk
And he—
He erected a beautiful city

Title: Do Re Mi
Release Date: May 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-do-re-mi-lyrics
Song Description: Do Re Mi is one of the last-known songs written by Kurt Cobain before his death in April 1994.

Cobains widow, Courtney Love, described the song in a 1994 Rolling Stone interview, explaining that

It was the last thing he wrote on our bed. The chorus was Dough, Ray and me / Dough, Ray and me and then it was Me and my IV. I had asked him after Rome to freeze his sperm. So theres this whole thing about freezing your uterus

To date, no version of the song featuring the re-written Me and my IV lyrics has been released.  It has only been heard as Kurts acoustic home recording.

The title Do Re Mi, its title borrowed from a The Sound of Music song about the musical scale (note that Kurt plays a descending scale after the chorus).
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
And if I may, and if I might
Lay me down weeping
And if I say, what is life?
I might be dreaming
If I may, what is right?
Summertime, see me yield
Those years in his body
A phrase from his pocket
In chains from the no-end, lifelong dream

Wake me up and see me
If I do, and if I lie

The verses refer to Kurts stomach pain and use of various medications (such as Percodans) to cure his pain.

The demo version was titled In His Room:

Another Nirvana track, Sappy was almost also named Verse Chorus Verse around the time of recording In Utero but since the title is shared by this earlier Nirvana song, it was retitled Sappy to differentiate between them.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Neither side is sacred
No one wants to win
Feeling so sedated
Think I'll just give in
Taking medication
Till my stomach's full
Neither side is sacred
Crawling in the hole

[Chorus]
The grass is greener over here
You're the fog that keeps it clear
Re-inventing what we knew
Taken time is all but true
You're the reason I feel pain
Feels so good to feel again

[Pre-Chorus]
Neither side is sacred
No one wants to win
Feeling so sedated
But I can't give in
Taking medication
Till my stomach's full
Feelin' so sedated
When I'm in my home

[Pre-Chorus]
Neither side is sacred

The grass is greener over here
You're the fog that keeps it clear
Re-inventing what we knew
Learn from history, all that’s true
You're the reason I feel pain
Feels so good to feel again

Title: Even in His Youth
Release Date: February 5, 1992, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-even-in-his-youth-lyrics
Song Description: Touted as one of Nirvanas more sad and thought provoking songs and with a sludgy, unmistakable Seattle vibe carrying it, Even in His Youth explores the estranged relationship and lack of acceptance given to Cobain by his father (despite his needing of it), dispute being in the proverbial prime of his life regarding this crucial aspect  his youth, which in turn constitutes quite possibly forming a linkage with Been a Son with this concept expressed in such a form.

Originally included on the Hormoaning EP released in February of 1992, exclusive to Japan and Australia markets, the song was included on the Nevermind re-release in 2011 alongside its fellow Teen Spirit b-side, Aneurysm, this is hailed among the Nirvana community for its enduring, almost-sorrowful message and enticing main riff, along with lyrics batted out by Cobain that makes the listener feel, too, just the struggle dealt with in the context.
Lyrics:

Title: Aero Zeppelin
Release Date: December 14, 1992, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-aero-zeppelin-lyrics
Song Description: This songs title fuses the name of two huge hard rock bands of the 70s: Aerosmith and Led Zeppelin. The lyrics are mainly about the trendiness of big showy metal acts, making fun of them a la Big Dumb Sex, hence all the soloing. Kurt wrote about it in his journals:

This song is not about Aerosmith or Led Zeppelin? Its about: The Cult, Faster Pussycat, Kingdom Come, Guns N Roses, Whitesnake, and Nirvana.

And on another occasion:

Christ!? Yeah, lets just throw together some heavy metal riffs in no particular order and give it a quirky name in homage to a couple of our favourite masturbatory 70s rock acts.

Which means the members Nirvana didnt dislike Aerosmith or Led Zeppelin  actually, theyve  included the formers Rocks in their Top 50 albums of all time list. The attack here is on bands that wanted to sound sort of like Aerosmith and sort of like Led Zeppelin, doing the masturbatory rock thing, but lacking any originality whatsoever.

Aero Zeppelin was recorded on January 23, 1988 in a recording session for their first studio demo tape.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
What's a season in a right, if you can't have anything?
What's the reason in a rhyme, if a plan means anything?
What's the meaning in a crime? It's a fan if anything
Where's the meaning in a line? It's a brand, it's a brand
How a culture comes again, it's a plan of yesterday
And you swear it's not a trend, doesn't matter anyway
They're only here to talk to friends, nothing new is everyday
You could shit upon the stage, they'll be fans
They'll be fans
They'll be fans
They'll be fans

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly!
Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally
Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays
An idea is what we lack, it doesn't matter anyways!

Title: Sifting
Release Date: June 15, 1989, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-sifting-lyrics
Song Description: Sifting is the eleventh track from Nirvanas debut album, Bleach.

Lead singer Kurt Cobain told Nick Soulsby, author of Cobain on Cobain:

They take a song and think that the whole album is like that. On Bleach, there was Sifting and the other slow, boring song Paper Cuts, two very slow songs, with less feedback, so they stick in peoples minds and they forget about the rest of the album."
Lyrics:

Title: Beeswax
Release Date: December 14, 1992, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-beeswax-lyrics
Song Description: Beeswax was recorded on January 23, 1988 in a recording session for Nirvanas first studio demo tape.

The lyrics are not only utterly bizarre, filled with violent sexual imagery, theyre also very hard to follow on the available recording.

This has led to countless different versions floating around the web. Including the one that was here on Genius before.

Some years ago, an image of a fragment of Kurt Cobains diary containing the lyrics were posted to the internet. The page was at display at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle so we can assume it is legit. It is possible  that Kurt does not sing the lyrics exactly as he had written it, but is still makes for the closest approximation available today.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I was a seeking out for a funnel
Not only magnets but I could pry bar it shut
Gluing my manhood towards a manhole

Hey, hey, a lightweight clutch

Tacky and thumbs on polyester

Vinegar and water is gaining monthly

Homesick a bay aboard the Love Boat

I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
Living without you girl, you only break my heart

[Chorus]
I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it, I can shape it, I can mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it
I can spank it, I can beat it, masturbate it

I've been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same old
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could

Title: Stain
Release Date: December 14, 1992, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-stain-lyrics
Song Description: Stain was recorded in September 1989 for the Blew EP sessions.

The song portrays the typical ne'er do well in the eyes of Kurt, and probably touches base on some of the criticism hes taken from his own friends and family, such as Tracy Marander, the girl who Kurt wrote About a Girl about. He was, A stain on society. In this sense, the lyrics are similar to Even in His Youth.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Well, he never bleeds and he never fucks
And he never leaves 'cause he's got bad luck
Well, he never eats and he never rusts
And he never sleeps 'cause he's got bad luck, yeah

Title: Hairspray Queen

Song Description: This song was featured on the compilation album Incesticide, released in 1992, although it was recorded in 1988.  Apparently when Nirvana performed the song live for the first time a girl approached Kurt Cobain after their set and asked if he made the lyrics up on the spot about her.  This also seems to be the first time Kurts lyrics were misinterpreted from what Kurt intended.

Hairspray Queen was recorded on January 23, 1988 in a recording session for their first studio demo tape.

Song Description: This is Nirvanas cover of Mollys Lips by The Vaselines, released in 1989. It was released on their 1992 compilation album Insecticide.

This song was written about Molly Weir according to Vaselines Eugene Kelly, presumably because her Rentaghost television character Hazel McWitch typically appeared in whiteface with emphatic red lips.

Song Description: The Steve Albini-recorded studio version of Pennyroyal Tea was originally released on 1993s In Utero, Nirvanas final studio album before Cobains death, and had been set to become their next single in April 1994.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture

Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty

Song Description: Beans was found on a 4-track home cassette dated between 1986 and 1988.

Release Date: November 23, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-curmudgeon-lyrics
Song Description: Curmudgeon is a B-side first featured on the Lithium single, and went on to be featured in various compilations since.

A curmudgeon is someone, especially an old person, who is ill-tempered or in a bad mood most of the time. The lyrics are coming from the perspective of this curmudgeon, given all the random rambles they make.

This song, along with Return Of The Rat and Oh, The Guilt were recorded on April 7th, 1992, which was the first studio recording the band made since Nevermind.
Lyrics:

The track was despised by Cobain, who wrote to the bands then-drummer Dale Crover:

Lyrics:

I can read, I can write
I can breed, proven flight

Title: On a Plain (Live Acoustic)
Release Date: November 1, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-on-a-plain-live-acoustic-lyrics
Song Description: Kurt Cobain expresses a sense of self-love that hasnt been seen throughout the previous duration of this project. He accuses himself of it not being okay to love himself more than whoever he is talking about due to the previous themes being talked about. The plain he is talking about could be an artificial high caused by this new found love, but this high is temporary.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'll start this off without any words
I got so high I scratched 'till I bled
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The finest day that I've ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

[Verse 2]
My brother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

[Verse 3]
It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
And one more special message to go
And then I'm done, and I can go home
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

Oh yeah, I need you to do a little beat, so I can keep time

Title: Blandest
Release Date: November 23, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Nirvana-blandest-lyrics
Song Description: Blandest was recorded on June 6, 1988. heres what producer Jack Endino had to say about the song:

"Blandest didnt come out very well and they opted to re-record it at a later time because the song was just not ready yet. They instructed me to record over this version which we did. I never even kept a cassette of it myself so the bootleg copies of it that exist must have come from band members' rough mix cassettes, perhaps stolen ones. When they were planning Incesticide Krist called me up and wanted to know if I remembered Blandest and if there was a tape of it anywhere; I told him no, you guys told me to erase it! Imagine how spooked I was when I later heard it on a bootlegtenth-generation cassette tape hiss, horrible fried 3-AM rough mix and all"

Title: Nirvana’s Top 50 Albums

Song Description: Kurt Cobains journals were released in 2002 by Riverhead Books. It contained notes, letters, shopping lists, drawings and other miscellanea by Nirvanas frontman.



One of the most interesting pages in the Journals is this list, titled TOP 50 by NIRVANA, so we can infer this was a collaboration by Cobain, Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic. It is not dated, but probably was scribbled around 1993.

I'm gonna open up myself a flea market
I'm gonna open up myself a flea market
And you're gonna wish that you did
Gonna retire on the profits
First off, I'm gonna empty out all of my Mrs. Butterworth jars
And I'm gonna put 'em on a shelf
With my 800 dollar a month tax free Century21 shop
And then I am going to put my Mrs. Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf
Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups
I've accumulated over the past 62 years

Then I'm going to get some plywood
I'm going to get some plywood
And cut them up into two by two feet squares
Then I'm going to get some burlap
And I'm going to cut them into two by two feet squares
And then I'm going to put them onto the pieces of plywood
And then I'm going to go to the beach
I'm going to go to the beach
And I'm gonna collect some shells and driftwood

And then I'm going to take the shells and driftwood
And glue them onto the plywood and burlap
And sell 'em for lots of money
People will be paying top dollar
For my kids' new used new toys and clothing
Then maybe someday I can get rid of that piss-stained mattress
I've been sleeping on

[Chorus]
I'm gonna die
Start a new union
I'm on a hill
Help my libido

Start a new union
I'm gonna cry
Help my libido
