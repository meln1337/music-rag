Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Sew it on
Face the fool
December's tragic drive
When time is poetry
And stolen the world outside
The waiting could crush my heart

[Verse 2]
Sew it on
Face the fool
The tide breaks, a wave of fear
And brave songs disappear
To the secret voice of dawn
This last time raise my eyes

[Chorus]
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
The right words in time
The right words

[Verse 3]
Sew it on
Face the fool
The mirrors lie, those aren't my eyes
Destroy them, raise my hand
Reflected in savage shards
A new face, a soul reborn

So I say, still awake

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
But you were always one to stay the same, girl
I know you want to be the rain
And I know that we would fall in there
For a time and then unfall again
For a while, I'll take you burying old bones
Dawn's grey, the sign in the winter light
And I know that you can feel the pain
Your eyes speak one hundred million lies

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you've gone astray
I walk in circles
I've seen million things that tell me so

[Verse 2]
But I was one to play the fool, girl
Though rules were somewhat dark to me
And I know that we could fall in there
For a time and then unfall again
For a while, I give you darium bound stones
Grow through the roots of your mind set apart
And I know that you can feel the pain
Your eyes speak one hundred million lies

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you've gone astray
I walk in circles
I've seen million things that tell me so

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the lonesome world of Abel
Where every brother's knife is set to slay you
And paranoia keeps you healthy
Crooked deals can keep you wealthy
Serum vials to help you when you're sad

[Verse 2]
Every other face is bent and broken
Wrap your teeth around the only game in town
Made you clothes from insulation
Break your day for pay and ration
Hide
Hide
Hide

[Chorus]
Killed by an angel
Lost inside amazing colors
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle
Let's say you found a gun
How would your bad side burn?

It comes in a bottle

Killed by an angel
Lost inside amazing colors
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle
Let's say you found a gun
How would your bad side burn?
It's never how you feel

[Bridge]
The way the sea reflects the sun
Long gone
And all the miracles of love
Long gone
You hold your heart out in your hand
One last long sigh gone
One last long sigh gone
[Verse 4]
When you see the sores you can't believe them
Pathogenic lovers in a basement cell
Dirty white sheets cut up in strips
Cracks in the mirror, and your mind slips
Serum vials to help you when you're sad

[Chorus]
Killed by an angel
Lost inside amazing colors
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle
Let's say you found a gun
How would your bad side burn?
It's never how you feel

Hollow peaks we've climbed
All these things I've seen
How it feels to be something on
That's how the days go

A field of wires will see what it's worth to walk

Title: Pheurton Skeurto
Release Date: May 10, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Sunny-day-real-estate-pheurton-skeurto-lyrics
Song Description: According to the band, Pheurton Skeurto is about the predatory nature of the music industry towards up-and-coming bands, as they experienced it in their early career.

We were the darlings of the music industry in Seattle and major labels were pursuing us like vultures, coming to every show, giving us treats beyond measure, showing us, like, the entrance to the Willy Wonka factory and promising us millions and pursuing us. And all we wanted to do was write and play music, preferably in our basement and preferably just with each other. [] I think its the perfect encapsulation of what it is to be kind of the thing of the moment, and to be pursued by the machine that desperately wants to monetize and turn you into something.

Dan Hoerner, on the Life of the Record podcast
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
How will they know just where to find?
Under this bridge I lie down
See how they run catch butterfly
Trip over words with gifts and garage
Pheurton

[Verse 2]
How will they learn just where to find?
Down on their knees holding hairpiece
See how they flock ten for some grapes
Trip over words with gifts and garage
Pheurton dance

How will they learn?
How will they know?
How?

How is it you feel?
I remember you in the top of my room
All these things we wondered how to hide
See how it works when
All the day long in a mantle of mud
All these fears we wondered how to hide with our love

How is it you feel when you run?
Ships won't come in in a mantle of mud
All this time looking for love
And you want to find peace
And you find me
Mondrary fields, where we run
See how it works with a bottle of rum
All this time hiding from death
And we want to be strong
But we find...

The true story, a tale
Writing itself as we sail
A story, a tale
Writing itself as we wail
Oh, no

Never again, my dear
Should we come dancing here
We'll play guitar and video games

Glimmering and everything, another skull
You said it was dangerous
Found out the place where you were going
Follow me down the path
I take your hopes, I promise you this
A dying, cold world, but gold
Shimmering gold

Only laughing about our gilded wasteland
Devoured, torn into pieces

Small things ever calling out your name

Title: The Sharkâ€™s Own Private Fuck
Release Date: September 8, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Sunny-day-real-estate-the-sharks-own-private-fuck-lyrics
Song Description: Many believe this song to be about the bassist, Nate Mendel leaving Sunny Day Real Estate to join Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters.

Enigk uses imagery of a hostile stereotypical capitalist setting to frame Mendel leaving the band. It can be implied that Enigk may be blaming the nature of the music industry, one that possesses these bleak, impersonal characteristics described in the lyrics, for Mendel leaving the band and their youthful spirit being crushed.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
We choke on the poison wind
Well, these sad eyes can tell the story
Walk along an empire's path
And you said you'd come back again
But you talk to yourself
Believing the fear that drives your greed
When you discover the empty place
A hollow world of instant pleasures

[Chorus]
The way you were
So disturbed
What's your worth?

[Post-Chorus]
Try to smile as they devour our youth

[Verse 2]
With a diamond eye, you gaze
At the blackened plains spread out beneath you
When the lights go out
You see the world as you have never known it
And I talked to myself
Believing that you would come back again

The way you were
So disturbed
What's your worth?
What is it you heard?

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Stay a while with
Running out with (?) time (nine) servants
Trip through the warm wind (part we made)
Through their talking
My impression grows
Suede scars part of our own dream world

[Chorus]
We climbed the wreck
Cold hammer heart
Still beating
And though we know not now the reason why
Well I'd suspect
Guilt covered charm
In my hand
My eyes reflect the surface very well

[Verse 2]
Why'd I (wide eye) compromise
Suede scars untie me slow
The way you restart again
I'm all talk again
When I'm on top of the world
The way you restart with me

Long days, caught in his room
Trapped in the gloom of the dying light
His heart pleads through the wounds that he bleeds
The wounds he never can close
Wrong way, mind in a haze
Never know what he could do
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my soul
Now she's gone again.'
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my blood
Now she's gone again.'

[Verse 2]
Long days, alone with his shame
Fanning the flames of desire
His heart breaks as his memory plays images of her betrayal
Wrong way, his mind in a rage
Never know what he could do
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my soul
Now she's gone again.'
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my blood
Now she's gone again.'

Pacing his room with his dark thoughts
His heart breaks at the road he must take
The road that will lead to the end
Wrong way, he thinks it's time for release
He'll never know peace in his lifetime
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my soul
Now she's gone again.'
He thinks, 'I gave her my heart, she tasted my blood
Now she's gone again.'

When the pain helps us rise
Here we stay
Though it's only a clever game
Running from our lives

But if we try to lift up our eyes
Replacing the lies
We own this moment
Everything and everyone and in the end we all are one
The truth will not be denied
Everything and everyone and in the end we all are one
The truth will not be denied

And it's strange
How we're selling our time and we wait
We are lost in a clever game
Running from our lives
And they lead us on
But if we try to lift up our eyes
Replacing the lies

Title: Jâ€™Nuh
Release Date: November 7, 1995, URL: https://genius.com/Sunny-day-real-estate-jnuh-lyrics
Song Description: If youre wondering how come there are two versions for the same lyrics, well, heres the explanation:

We broke up and we just felt like we were done. We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there arent lyrics! In a lot of cases, we never sat down to write them, because we just wanted to get it out of the way as fast as possible. So I just sang a lot of gibberish, which makes it really quirky. My favorite is the Japanese translations!
Lyrics:

(interpreted by jamie sobol)
And then a green bird, a few, that play all around me
(and in a river I view a play of her and me)
Under the shade of a tree, her arms did comfort

Call the clerk, remind me tuesday
One pumpkin knife to pry out our hands on plastic wounds

They wound together then laughing hands on big ears and
Very unnecessary to spill to tell a joke

Call the clerk on tuesday morning
One pumpkin knife to pry out their hands on silver bars

I'm too, well I'm too late now send love like me
It's not fair it's gone outside

I'm too, well I'm too late now
Call me something at all this time

I'm too, well I'm too late now
Call me something a sparrow sings

I'm too, well I'm too late now
Call me something at all this time

Their hands a plastic wound

They went together then
Laughing, and say big ears
And very unnecessary to spill to tell a joke

Call the clock on tuesday morning
A pumpkin knife to cry out
Their hands in silver bars

I'm too
I'm too late now
Said, not like me, not that it's gonna sigh

For we reached to one against all white
Left smoke in your eyes

Let us sometimes (some time to) fly away

Words will look like this, oh

It's her imagination
Untie my hands so I can fly away
To another world and they
Were offering me good advice
Try to tie an arrow

Original members Jeremy Enigk, Dan Hoerner, and William Goldsmith finally brought Novum Vetus to life with the help of new members Greg Suran and Chris Jordan at Seattles London Bridge Studio.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
The day we died inside, the world was suffering
Ten thousand worlds collide, but no one said a thing
If I was late, at least I tried
The day we died inside, the walls come tumbling down
Far removed from the wounds, you can see
Every open door
Is a world turned on it's side
All these things we've said before
Linger on
Ha

[Verse 1]
Higher place to go
And then remind us
Who we're supposed to be
When empty words dividÐµ
And nowhere solid ground
Ten thousand voicÐµs cried, but no one heard the sound
The fires burn, the mills die
The day we realize that time is running down
Far removed from the wounds, they still breathe
Every open door
Is a world turned on its side
All these dreams we shared before
Hollow echoes today

Days will rise, and we'll be young
Leave behind, won't you say girl?
You ought to run with me for a while

In every empty room
There is space to grow
Where I do say too much
Could it be this time
That every ending show
That I don't care anymore?
I'm gonna leave it behind

Lyrics:

(Does this) wilted flower seem strange to you
With all this poison at the roots?
Shut away from love and light
And you wonder why its screaming...

Old enough to abuse me
But all too cheap to amuse me

We stand at the marketplace
With cold September eyes on the hungry people
We passed the interrogation
Signed our names at the bottom of the
Government paper

Calling memories out of mind
Pictures writhing deep inside
And once you've seen it's hard to hide
You wonder why you're screaming

Strong enough not to fear me
But all too loud now to hear me

We stand at the marketplace
With cold September eyes on the hungry people
We passed the interrogation
Signed our names at the bottom of the
Government paper

Lyrics:

Now they're swerving when I give
And now it's turning away from my impression at all
It's choleric months in baritone
But waiting for the tide out
Right in they're calling me

Words at hiding are revoked
But waiting for this I'll blend in the covering
When it's tried, embarrass
A late song in the late leaf
Things will come anywhere

Inside of me
Outside of you
Waiting closer to there
I'd swear that goes with our dreams
What's wrong with me
Another side of you

In every type a value
But now it's turning away from my impression at all
There was a time when running
I went swimming
And you pulled me to come back

Long weeks hiding melody
And now it's starting awake at my impression at all
The clock strikes hope
And time to bring
But now it's turning into a beast like you
You might also likeI don't need them

And swear that you've seen better things

Many clothes to borrow
To quell that song

Interpreted by Jeremy Campbell

Though it's swerving when I give
The Lord's turning away from my impression that all
Choleric months in baritone
But waiting for the tide out
Right in they are calling me

Words at hiding are revoked
But waiting for the soap and then the cup of rain
Where it's tied, embarrassed
But lay inside the lake
And these things will come anywhere
(chanted in the back round is "Iscar-abaid")
Inside of me
Outside of you
Awaking closer to the light
To swear that those were better dreams
What's wrong with me
Am I tired of you?

Irreverent type of melanoma
There is no turning away from my impression that all
Losing sight when running
I went swimming and you pulled me to come in

Long weeks hiding melaâ€¦.noma (voice drags on this
Part)
Now I'm staring, awake, at my impression that all
The clock strikes twelve and time to breathe
But now it's turning into things I know

Turning them
Lights the way there
Think I'll be there with Him?
Thank you Jesus

(chanted in the back round is "Iscar-abaid")
Inside of me
Outside of you
Carried closer to the light
And swear that you've seen better things
Wipe the slate
Well am I to see
Mary cross my own blood and soul
*I worked and studied this song for about 3 hours
Because I was sure that the previous translations
While good, lacked a few things that I heard. I've
Come to a conclusion that this song is about a child
Who has brain tumors (melanoma). It's basically about
The child coming to grips with his disease. Notice
The line about his impression, and how it develops
Through the song: turning away from my impression, no
Turning from my impression, now I'm staring at my
Impression. Also people with melanoma frequently
Pass out, this explains why he can't take a bath
("waiting for the soap and cup of rain") and also
Explains why he can't go swimming ("Losing sight when
Running, I went swimming and you pulled me to come in")
The end of the song shows the kid losing his life to
The disease and going to heaven where all pain is

Lyrics:

The scars tell the memory
The way she moves I'm brought to my knees
And I refuse
So goes for waiting
Her footprints were here
And I return
When will words last?
I found my home
You comfort me
Soon, I look...
They come in me

Hold my thoughts they're all that I have now
Hold my tears they're all that's left for you
If I should fall from grace with you my Lord
Then sometimes...

The sky fell
The pictures scar
What dead men hide
It's all in our minds
I refuse
So goes my something
This story I heard
I return
When will words last?
I found my home
You comfort me
Soon eyes look
They come in and...

Hold my tears they're all that's left for you
If I should fall from grace with you dear Lord

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Of course
We're miles away from home
We sink like stones
And we're lost beneath the waves
Not a trace to mark the graves

Lost and tired
And chained

Of course
We plan the great escape
We drag our fate around the razor wire
But our fear keeps us in line

[Chorus]
Turn me inside out this time
Looking back the place that I come from
Disappeared
Turn my face
To the place where I go into the sun
Disappear into the sun

[Verse 2]
Lost and tired
And chained
You might also likeI know what sleeps inside my heart
There's a path that starts
With a single step at dawn
Though the road goes on and on

[Chorus]
Turn me inside out this time
Looking back the place that I come from
Disappeared
Turn my face
To the place where I go into the sun
Disappear into the sun

Turn me inside out this time
Looking back the place that I come from
Disappeared
Turn my face
To the place where I go into the sun
Disappear into the sun

[Bridge]
Deep inside a song a thousand miles away
Every moment starting at the break of day
Running to a field, a world we'll find

And now
The time has come for me
I must break free
From the prison I have made
And to face the way ahead
[Chorus]
Turn me inside out this time
Looking back the place that I come from
Disappeared
Turn my face
To the place where I go into the sun
Disappear into the sun
Disappear into the sun...Embed

A soul many times revealed

With these arms I will break through you
Wait only to see you far removed

Day dawned and I saw your face
