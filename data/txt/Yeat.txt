Artist: Yeat, Alternate Names: Lil Yeat, Psycho CEO, Noah Olivier Smith, LUH GEËKY, Kranky Kranky
Artist Description: Noah Olivier Smith (born February 26, 2000), better known by his stage name Yeat, is an American recording artist, producer, and engineer from Lake Oswego, Oregon and based in Los Angeles, California.

In an interview with Our Generation Music, Yeat explained the origins of his stage name, expressing how he wanted a short name that’s recognizable.

I’m not gon' lie, it was kinda just like some high shit. […] It’s like, uh, I just wanted to do something like one word, I don’t know why. And just make it like, like hella simple, and like something kind of relatable like when people hear my name, they feel like they already heard of me type shit.

He began rapping in 2016 under the alias Lil Yeat. Two years following this, his name change from Lil Yeat to Yeat was debuted with the release of his song “Brink!” in mid-2018. After a slew of singles, Yeat released his first EP, Deep Blue Strips, in late 2018. In 2019, Yeat would gain further publicity after “Stay Up,” the lead single off his second project and first mixtape, Wake Up Call, received a music video on the popular YouTube channel ELEVATOR. Yeat released Different Creature, a collaborative EP with Dutch producer Clibbo, on July 18, 2019, to positive feedback. Yeat garnered further attention after dropping his first full-length album, I’m So Me, at the conclusion of the year, collaborating with popular producers like Wheezy, Brandon Finessin, and 10Fifty, among others.

Yeat continued to gain traction throughout 2020, releasing two EPs meant to hold fans over until Different Creature 2. The project was scrapped as he worked through label issues before becoming independent in 2021. Fully in control of his output, Yeat began releasing a barrage of music, including twenty track albums and countless singles. Yeat saw a major jump in support after his songs “Sorry Bout That” and “Dub” blew up on TikTok. Subsequent hits like “Money Twerk” and “Gët Busy” helped reinforce his newfound success.

On August 5, 2021, Yeat released his EP, Trëndi, as a teaser before his debut studio album, Up 2 Më. Released on September 10, 2021, the album was a sleeper hit, eventually peaking at #58 the week of February 19, 2022, on the Billboard 200. Up 2 Më ultimately marked the beginning of Yeat’s upstart in mainstream rap, as icons like Drake began to notice his musical talents.

Yeat released his second studio album, 2 Alivë, on February 18, 2022. Picking up features from rap heavyweights such as Young Thug and Gunna, the album debuted at #6 on the Billboard 200 during the week of March 5, 2022. Yeat followed up with a deluxe version of 2 Alivë on April 1, 2022, which included noteworthy features from artists Lil Uzi Vert and East London phenom, Lancey Foux. Continuing the promising start of the year, Yeat scored a song with Illumination Entertainment for the Minions: The Rise of Gru trailer, “Rich Minion,” further adding to his list of accomplishments.

Yeat’s refreshing sound with his volatile vocals, energetic electronic beats, and infectious melodies — even innovation of slang phrases such as “twizzy” and “Tonka” — ensures his spot as one of SoundCloud’s new wave pioneers. Remnant of the early careers of Young Thug and Playboi Carti, his distinctive voice and standout delivery brings an avant-garde sound to the rap scene.

Yeat released his highly anticipated extended play Lyfë, on September 9th 2022, with the single “Talk” preceding the EP a week before. Lyfë has a sole feature from Philadelphia rapper Lil Uzi Vert. Lyfë debuted at #10 on the Billboard Top 200.

Title: Already Rich
Release Date: May 3, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Yeat-already-rich-lyrics
Song Description: Already Rich is a long-teased track by Yeat on which he uses several different flows over an up-tempo beat.

This song was leaked during the summer of 2021, before the release of Yeats debut studio album Up 2 Me, and quickly gained popularity among fans.

While many fans lost hope for an official release of the song, the song was randomly released on May 3, 2023, on major streaming services. This version of the song features an altered version of the intro, which seems to be a fan edit. The cover art comes from an Instagram story posted by Yeat on April 11, 2023.

Title: Poppin
Release Date: February 18, 2022, URL: https://genius.com/Yeat-poppin-lyrics
Song Description: Poppin comes up with a BenjiCold produced beat with a hard bass on it. The song was previewed as Love And Drugs before real name was known. This serves as the introduction track to Yeats debut major-label album, 2 Aliv.

On February 11, the Lyrical Lemonade video for Still Countin included a beat switch with Poppin towards the end.

On March 16, 2022, the music video for Poppin was released to Lyrical Lemonade. This version did not have the same footage or similarity to the other version of the video from the Still countin music video.

Cole Bennett, the director behind Lyrical Lemonade also spoke in an interview with Our Generation Music about an original version of Poppin that was allegedly around five minutes long, but was condensed due to the short listen-span of most viewers.

I loved Poppin, but Poppin was too long. It was like five minutes at the time; and, uh, you know after a while you kinda get lost in the record, it felt less like a put-together song with layers.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
I need my drugs, I need my love (We get high)

Title: If We Being Rëal
Release Date: February 16, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Yeat-if-we-being-real-lyrics
Song Description: If We Being Ral by Yeat is a great example of the futuristic theme in the album 2093. In this song, Synthetic and others use futuristic hard-hitting instruments to give us a perfect blend of what we know as modern rap (or rap) and futuristic rap. Yeat has been rapidly promoting his new style, but if you pay close attention, his lyrics often evoke similar themes. Yeat is big on cutting ties and having real friends in order to pursue his dreams and visions. This theme has set the mood for many of his songs, such as Real is Rare (leak). If we being ral is a true step up on how he delivers these themes. This song scopes in on this theme, as well as the themes of success and power (which has also been seen in many other songs in 2093).
Lyrics:

[Verse]
I had to let a little off, yeah
I had to cut the pill off, yeah
But if we bein' real though, yeah
Nah, I don't never feel nothin' (Yeah, yeah)
I'm steady jumpin' the gun, yeah, like I do it for fun
You act like you do it for real, but, no, you is not one of us
You never could come inside of this buildin' we run
Inside of this world we run, we do it for us
No, we don't fuck with one of them at all, at all
We don't fuck with you at all
(No, no) No, I won't pick up your calls, uh
No, l don't like you at all, huh
I kind of wanna see you fall
I keep on chasin' the highs, I know I can never get back, so I'm always on low
And I got eyes on the back of my head, I got eyеs everywherе, so I know where you go (Yeah, yeah)
I could drop ties in this bitch
Drop like flies in this bitch

I take the plane to another level
I take the heights to a newer level
I take gettin' high to a newer level
Keep diggin' your grave, I'll pass you the shovel, yeah

Turban is one of Yeats most streamed songs, and, after gaining online popularity, its instrumental was featured in a Nike commercial for Dicks Sporting Goods in May 2022.
Lyrics:

[Intro]

[Pre-Chorus]
Perfect, rockin' a turban (Oh yeah, oh yeah)

I'm 'bout to sign for a lot 'cause this shit ain't urgent (Okay)
I got a whole lot of money comin' in (All day)
They told me it's a couple thots waiting outside, told 'em, "Bring 'em in" (Okay)
She said that she wanna come pull up and suck on my cock, told her, "Drink my kids"
I knew all this shit from the start, so I already told you what it all is
Oh my, oh my gosh, oh my goodness, ah

[Chorus]

Title: Breathe
Release Date: February 16, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Yeat-breathe-lyrics
Song Description: Previewed by Yeats girlfriend @symoneyry on an Instagram story. Breathe by Yeat, from the album 2093

The song showcases Yeats unapologetic attitude and hunger for success.

Produced by Bart How he flips the beat by taking the sample from REGULAR SHOW: SEASON 3  EPISODE 7s Basketball Guy.
Moreover, its pretty unique to see the fusion of Electro Indian Dhol (Barrel drum) in Yeats flavor throughout the song. Adding on, the song exudes relentless energy as Yeat boasts about his financial achievements and dismisses anyone who gets in his way. The chorus emphasizes his disregard for others' opinions and relentless drive to succeed, while the verses delve into his confidence and determination to rise above the rest. With its aggressive delivery and bold lyrics, Breathe captures Yeats uncompromising pursuit of greatness in the face of any obstacle.

But the devil told me everything fine
I just woke up, fucked that bitch in her spine
I don't be doin' shit on the online

Copped a double, then I tripled it down
Bitch, I don't want nothin', don't wait in no line

Lyrics:

[Part I]

[Intro: Yeat]
You live and you learn
Except I don't feel like that
You live and you don't learn

[Verse 1: Yeat]
I wonder what I could've did and what I never did
I wonder what you could've hid and what you could've said
It's not a lot of people like us, so I have respect
But don't go talkin' out your neck unless you love bein' dead
I might go crazy, I'm out my head
I might kill 'em and drop 'em dead
I might have did it but I don't think I did
I might have done some things I never did
What would you do if everything was just not for you?
What would you do if every time you jumped, the hula hoop's on fire?
Girl, tell me, just don't lie
Who'll tell me when you lie?
Don't tell me when you cry
Just inform when you die
I don't search for nothin', I'm not one to go and pry
But I'm one to leave ya' backstabbed and leave ya' blind
A cut across the eyes will leave you blind for life
It only takes one time, it only takes a night
I brought the big AR out and you brought the knife
I'ma kill ya' nice and quick, that's kinda kind
And don't go waste my time
And don't go talkin' to me if you know you not even mine
See Yeat LiveGet tickets as low as $230You might also like[Verse 2: Yeat]
I own a private jet
I'm on a power trip
You don't have to say what you did
I already know before you say it
Pushin' buttons an instrument, so let me play it
I ain't heard you, so speak up, what you gon' say?
Somebody gettin' saved tonight
Somebody gettin' played tonight
Got a very bad but very good mind
A whole lot of things look worse in the light
And a whole lot get worse when you try
That's why I'll let a lot of things fly
If I could, then I would
I don't ever get stuck to a thing unless it's good
Is it good for me, or bad for you, or both of us?
And it's hard to believe you more than most of us
Ridin' 'round, a gun inside my pocket, like I'm supposed to
They ain't never gonna let you in, they ain't supposed to
Every time you walk a mile, you only a inch closer
Keep on inchin' like a slug 'til it's over
Keep in mind that this shit ain't gon' be over
Keep in mind when you push me, push me over
I'm a G-Wagon, you a Range Rover
And it's hard for me to ever stay sober
I'ma sit down at the top until it's over
Wait 'til it's over
Wait 'til it's over
[Part II]

[Verse: Yeat & Childish Gambino]
Oh, movin' (All that we have's the future)
Oh, places with ya' (Oh)
In this new life now (Ah)
I told myself, "Never again," but I did it again, I do it every time
Movin' fast, movin' slow, movin' sideways at times
When I'm high and I can't hide behind the lies
And I know that you know that you feel that
'Cause you couldn't look me in my motherfuckin' eyes (But you barely even talk to me)
All that we have's the future (We livin' a fuckin' lie)
In this new life now, it's a new life now

[Outro: Yeat]
The plane just landed, from my trip
But I'm always up there on that trip5Embed

Title: U could tëll
Release Date: September 10, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Yeat-u-could-tell-lyrics
Song Description: In this song, Yeat raps about how good it feels now that he is at the top of the game with his homies. He also touches on his heavy use of drugs, the large amounts of money he spends, how much sex he has, and how much better he is than his opposition. This is one of the most original instrumentals he has chosen, going from calm strings to very fast and energetic electronic sounds. He also adds his crazy backs, that almost sound like they are in the instrumental (which is kind of crazy if you think about it). Great performance.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
When you rich like this, it feel great
When you get a lot of shit on your plate
When you get to the top with the dawgs
You get to flex all that shit in their face
You could tell them lil' boys a disgrace
You could tell that we been in first place
You could tell that I go in this Tonka
To hell what I look to, to hell what I chase
I'm just ridin' in the Tonka, bitch, I'm on this shit
You don't know how the fuck it feel to be this fuckin' rich
I just popped a X pill and half my body glitched
I thought everybody stayed the same, everybody fuckin' switched

[Verse]
Had to take a break from X, bitch, I could feel it in my chest
Bitch, I need a Percocet before I start to get upset
We get rowdy, we go crazy, we gon' turn up for that check
Had to go and put some diamonds on my neck so they show me some respect
I said, "Fuck yo Masi', bitch, I'm in a Lamb' truck," yeah
Might go hit my garage and pull out the GLE for fun
We could be shittin' on 'em all day, we do it for fun
They said that they went and touched the moon, I touched the sun
I went and got me the Tonka, that big body, bitch, I bagged back, I went and just ran it up
I don't be savin' my money, I spend it all day, bitch, I made it all back, yeah, I doubled up
Thotty gon' pull up on me, she gon' gulp up my dick like a motherfuckin' 7-Eleven cup
I could keep goin' for days but I just gotta chill just so they think that they close to us
Yeah, turn this shit up, they are not close to us
We some real rockstars, it's a pill, pop all of 'em
I got beef with my kidney, he said that we got a problem
He must've thought that we was kidding, my twizzy pulled up and just popped him
I don't feel the sun, no, not at all
I'm inside my home, I'm turning up but I'm not alone
I just got the Chrome Heart, mixed it up, then sauced it on
My bitch gon' pull up on me, eat my bone, she bite it off

Title: Mysëlf
Release Date: February 24, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Yeat-myself-lyrics
Song Description: On Myslf, Yeat discloses his past experience with drug abuse and mentions his disregarding way of life.

The tracks instrumental builds on 2022s Cant stop it, using the same drum roll. Despite the track conversing serious topics about drug abuse, the instrumental gradually relays an optimistic tone because of the violin used towards the end of the song, progressing in a higher scale rather than a lower one.

BNYX  the tracks producer  later confirmed via Twitter that both Cant stop it and Myslf were originally one track before, hence the similarity between both instrumentals:

cant stop and myself was originally 2 songs in one. Not lazy and not a loop

Title: Tell më
Release Date: February 16, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Yeat-tell-me-lyrics
Song Description: This song is a song that defines 2093 pretty much. On this song, Yeat seems to be aware of the potential planned dystopian future were headed towards, slowly becoming a reality with technologies like the Apple Vision Pro, advanced AI, China developing a social credit system. Robots taking over jobs, and the production of Elon Musks Neuralink chip.



The entire main theme of this album also that hasnt been pointed out is its direct inspiration from the 2009 movie Mr. Nobody, which takes place in 2092, which makes sense why he referenced 2092 on one of his Instagram stories.


The movie is about a person who can travel time and is the last mortal in the future where all mankind have merged with machine. Something Yeat claims to have seen on this album.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Flying 'round the world (whoa-oh-ah), married to the game
Picture to a frame, yeah, I ain't gon' change
Tell me what else, tell me your tale
It's easier to scream, I'll send you straight to hell
I love Hell, Hell on earth
It's a burnt smell (Yeah), as far as I could tell
It get deeper than a well
I don't wish you well, yeah, I don't give a fuck
Yeah, richer than the world
Got this new kind of money
You should see these new bills
You wouldn't know any better
I just put it all together, send a note to a letter
Write my sins off, yeah, know the blood better
Turn the wheel to the left, right, not better
Go be fake, bitch, yeah, being real's not better
I could tell a couple lies, yeah, you could tell I misled 'em
Look me in the eyes, don't tell me what you see
And I randomly tweak, I'll knock you off your feet
I been out for weeks, it get easier for me
But don't tell me, "Go help yourself," you can go and die
Do what you want, I won't hold the gun (I won't hold a grudge)
But imagine me there, with a dead-blank stare
I was tryna warn you, but it seem like you don't care
And it's fine, that's fair, yeah, I would never care
I don't need to see, yeah, I don't need to hear
I don't wanna talk to you, yeah, I don't want you near
I never would care, Who said "Life ain't fair"?
It's fair enough to me, I'ma let you feel free (Yeah)
And I do it better, so I know that you could feel (Yeah)
I do it for me, I don't do it for you
And it's cool
Lotta baggage to unpack, and it's cool
I can't go back on my words 'cause that'd be rude
Yeah, I like being disrespectful and that's cool
I'ma break you apart and feed you to fish for food
We live in the dark, live on the moon
I guess two-zero-nine-three is not for you (You, you, you, you)

Now I want you to feel
Everything's near

Eat an organ, you live forever
Yeah, I was born to live forever
Forever
Don't you feel good? You say you feel good (Good)

Pay more just to feel

Title: 2093
Release Date: February 16, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Yeat-2093-lyrics
Song Description: Slightly uncustomary compared to Yeats other tracks, 2093 sees his futuristic way of life, adoration for the illicit mixture dubbed as lean (a concoction consisting of liquid codeine and soda) and his narcissistic behaviorcomparing his life to Gods and flaunting large sums of money.

Building on the fact that the track is very unusual from Yeats normal rage-infused vocals and instrumentals, he has mentioned that rage rap has gotten old to him and wants to pivot towards a more futuristic wave of rap in an interview with Complex:

Im trying to make futuristic rap with a mix of sounds [] Im making my own genre. My own style. Alternative mixed with rap. Its different. Shits crazy.

Yeat has previewed the track numerous times throughout his labels Instagram account, as well as his personal Instagram.

The year 2093 has also been mentioned countless times on the teaser for the highly-anticipated album, as well as Instagram stories.

The instrumental, identical to February 2023s Nun id change, features heavy kick and a dreamy synthesizer accompanied by heavy bass.

Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Lived a lot of life, not a thing's changed, uh
A lot of things change, people don't change
I just spent a quarter million on a fuckin' chain
I just spent a quarter million on that fuckin' plane
I just spent a half million on a Cullinan
I just spent a quarter million on a butler, man
Yeah, coverin' my face like Jimmy Butler, man, yeah
I got couple watches, couple watches move
We don't go band for band, we go bill for bill (Yeah)
We don't link and build, we make buildings build
Dystopian society on Silent Hill
I just wanna feel things, I wanna feel real
I wanna feel like normal human, don't wan' pop a pill
I wash my hands of all the blood and then I keep it real
Just tell me how you feelin'
Whеn you come inside this building, tell mе how you feelin'
I don't wanna hear your lies, I wanna hear how you feelin'
How you really feelin', how you really dealin'
No discussions to you, I could probably buy your crib, man
I don't know nobody at all, I'm not even from this planet
I could take the first shuttle off, but I don't even know where I'm landin'
I don't even know my home phone, I don't even know my planet
Don't even know how I made this shit, don't even know how I planned it
Used to be poppin' Percocet like shit was fuckin' candy
I'm gon' call up Elon Musk and ask him, "Where we landin'?"
I just called up SpaceX and ask 'em, "Where my planet?"
I can't listen to what you said, I told you to fuckin' can it
Divide is way too real, but now I understand it
Underestimated you, but now I understand it
I can't listen to no music, I can't fuckin' stand it
Popped so many X pills, I don't know how I'm standin'
When you live like me so much and then you understand it

When you feel amazin', do you feel a mess?
I feel amazin', feel it in my chest
When I take a breath, no, I don't inhale
If you said all that shit and you meant it
Don't take it back, don't take it back, don't take it
I seen a thousand things that I can't explain
But I did a thousand things that could put you away
And I know it's not for me 'cause I'm out of the way
When I live like this, you know that you never could stay
And I take it all too seriously, I never complain
But I lived a lot of lives, so I can't complain

Lived a lot of life, not a thing's changed, uh

And I would if I could
If I may, could I ask if I should?
On this life, you could never get enough
On a pill, you could never feel numb
Makin' money, it feels so good
Doing things that you never should2Embed

[Verse]
I just try keeping it real but I'm always gon' keep it a hundred
My bitch did a brand new favor, she just bе drinking my nut

I used to be eating noodle-oodles sittin' in the basement with the roaches in it
They used to not fuck with the kid, now I'm going up, everybody in my business
Said you can't trust me, lil' bitch, I'm a snake, go behind your back and stab it
You know it's not shit to go pull out the Wraith, bring it out in automatic
I OD on the pills so much, I hired a full-time medic
Pull up on my bitch and she eat me like lunch, said I got rid of her headache
I could tell real from the fake, we just be having abundance
Signing the deal, would you be on my faith? I got my money out of nothing
VS1 flawless, all of 'em shine
Yeah, told you stop hitting my phone, told you stop wasting my time
I got a big ol' bitch, she got a big behind
I just been sending them packs, I just been making them fly
I can't go back on my word, I already said that it's time
All of my twizzies is up, bitch, we been next in line
And these Yercs, they got me moody, yeah, y'all federal

Bitch, I'm on that X, I'm out in space

Can't be in the stu' with no thotties, yeah, can't be in the stu' with no Jakes
My money acrobat, I flip it twenty ways
The devil told me my time was ticking, I got like thirty days
Tell that boy I'm up, on my mama, told me that was disgrace
Pull up matte black, windows tinted, I can race
Way I make these hits and make this money, keep up the pace

Pulled up in this matte black, chopper hеlicopter
I just called Izaya, I told him we flying privatе jets

Pulled up in that kitted out lil' Bentley truck

Yeah, I told my bitch I feel her but I could barely feel a thing
I told my bitch I see her but I could barely see
I'm for real a geeker, l geek like every week

I could ship you Za' and get you lows or I could ship you shake
I'm high in the stu', I ain't go to sleep so this a wake and hit (I ain't even made it yet)
Take these Percs, they blue like Sonic
Audemars with the baguettes on it
Take these Ecstasy so I don't really have to go and stress on it

Make a band every day for a month, that's up to thirty K (Thirty)
I can't even put it in my cup, my bro got dirty Ks (Buh-buh-buh)
Still on them dirty drugs, I'm in my dirty ways

Crashed the Cayenne, you could tell that shit was dink (Yeah, yeah)
This a real rabbit, you could tell my coat is mink (Oh yeah, yeah)

Title: Morë
Release Date: February 16, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Yeat-more-lyrics
Song Description: The song explores themes of power, control, and insatiability. It depicts a persona who paradoxically, revels in losing control of himself, while still having control, playing mind games, and amassing wealth. Theres a sense of detachment from empathy or emotional connection, with a focus on materialism and dominance. The lyrics reflect on the pursuit of more, the consequences of excess, and the emptiness that accompanies it.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
You ain't felt this feeling, not once (Ooh, ah)
Yeah, I was tryna lie, you tryna lie more (Ooh, ah-ah, ah)
I don't like havin' the wheel
Matter of fact, I love losin' control
Playin' with they minds, remote control
It's a lot of shit I need and I still need more (Ooh, ah)

[Verse]
Uh, I go back to back, it's psycho CEO, uh (C—)
I got tired of this shit, I had to let you go
You remind me of something that I think I know, uh
It remind me of myself when I lose control, uh
I could lose control, uh, I'm a CEO, uh
You can't lose control, shit, 'cause you don’t have self control
And every time you thought you wanted somethin', you needed more
And then it come right back at you, throw you overboard
Yeah, comin' out the woods at your yellow Ford
Makin' trillion dollar monеy in this fuckin' Forbes
I'm a selfish fuck, yeah, I need morе
Wanna see you when you die, wan' see who bleed more
I piss diamonds, I'm a rich fuck
In the rich climate with a big truck (Ah-ah)
No, you can't get in with us, you a stupid fuck
And it's all on tabs when you rock with us (Ooh)
Put a condo on the moon so they can't talk to us (Huh, huh)
You can't talk to us
You can talk to a picture, you can talk through us
Yeah, I'ma hit it deep, I'ma hit it scuba (Huh, huh)

When you level up, you get that money like it's Follywood, and wouldn't you get surprised with this shit?
Wait, huh, I don't like surprises at all

Told the coach to put me in 'cause I'm just tryna ball
I go up in every season, even in the fall
I won't talk about 'em, I just cut 'em off
But they love to talk about me, love to run they mouth
Yeah, you love to run your mouth, but you ain't said shit
And you quick to say you'd do it, but you never did
If you talking to a god, keep it short and quick (Shh)
I'm busy living all this life that you'll nеver live
And y'all dick sucking, take my balls out your mouth
I got four rings, four albums, bitch, I'm out
I was alivе for 4L, but it's up to me for after now
You red, you need to take a breath before you pass out

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, uh, and these diamonds on 'em
When I walk inside this bitch, I feel like Stevie Wonder
I can't see nobody, nobody can see me
But everything I do is done in 3D
After everything I did, I know they need me
I don't ever wish 'em well, I just hope they bleed (Yeah, yeah)

I'm off the grid, yeah, I'm out the way
Paint a picture with some blood all day

[Post-Chorus]
(All day) I like a mixture
(All day) Off the drugs, but I miss 'em
(All day) I tried to warn you 'bout this shit, but you ain't listen anyway
(All day) I'm in 2093 all day

[Verse]
Am I wrong for bein' selfish?
Am I wrong for puttin' me first?
And I know why you confused, I got a way with words
Is it money? Is it power? Which one first?
I make more money than you ever did
I make a lot more money than ya' bitch
I might start talkin' crazy in this bitch
You might just go and drive into a ditch
I don't hear a word when you talk
I know that this world could be a lot
I know more than anybody else
I know what you do when you a mess
Tell me when you lie, tell me when you cry
But look me in the eye
I'm a busy guy, I'm out here betting lives
No regard for life, I roll it on the dice
Don't tell me twice, put it on the—, fuck that
Put it on ya life, you want a fairytale life
You want me to tuck you in bed, read you books all night
I live a trillion dollar life, I'll employ you a knight
I know it's always changin', every turn
I'll never look back on the bridge I burned
I'll tell you one thing that's wait the worth
Makin' all this money, enough to buy the Earth
See Yeat LiveGet tickets as low as $230You might also like[Chorus]
I bought the Earth, I sold it too
I'd sell ya' whole life if I could too
You can't fit in a pair of shoes

[Outro]
I'm a pandemic, always on the news
When it comes night, always on the loose
When it comes night, what you gon' do?
I don't need the light, I see right through
I see your reflection in my rearview
Damn, what a good view
Damn, what we could do?
Damn, I'm paranoid and rude
Damn, more disrespectful than you thought you knew5Embed

Title: Nëw turban
Release Date: April 1, 2022, URL: https://genius.com/Yeat-new-turban-lyrics
Song Description: Nw turban embodies a wavy and hard-hitting instrumentalcourtesy of producer Bugz Ronin, with a catchy chorus.

The track was originally previewed by Yeat via a livestream made on September 6, 2021 to social media platform Instagram. Yeat also previewed the track again before the release of his debut studio album, Up 2 M on a now-deleted Instagram post. The record ultimately did not make the final-cut for Up 2 M, but later made an appearance on 2 Aliv (Gek Pack), the deluxe version of his debut major-label studio album 2 Aliv. This track was previewed several times prior to the official release by Yeats associates such as Texas rapper Kankan and the producer of the track, Bugz Ronin.

The track was originally rumoured to feature Hip-Hop icon Drake or even Lil Uzi Vert, but released without any supporting features, ultimately debunking the rumor.

This track leaked in its entirety along with the rest of the deluxe version of the album on March 30, 2022.

Title: FOREVER AGAIN
Release Date: October 18, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Yeat-forever-again-lyrics
Song Description: FOREVER AGAIN is a track by Yeat, featuring on his album LYFESTYLE.

The track features a very unique and stand-out sound compared to the rest of the Trap and Experimental Rap songs on LYFESTYLE. It features a classic four-on-the-floor drum pattern, typically used in Dance and EDM songs. Fans also see Yeat step away from rapping and lean more into singing on this experimental track.

The first time fans heard the track was on September 27, 2024, when a well-known leaker previewed a 15-second, low-quality snippet of the track onto their Instagram account. At the time, this track was expected to feature on Yeats upcoming album, A Dangerous Lyfe, however, it is believed that the leaked snippet combined with high anticipation from fans pushed Yeat to release the track on his earlier album, LYFESTYLE.

Couple of pills and the blick in the whip, pull off on the feds, hol' up (DKanee)

Title: ORCHESTRATË
Release Date: October 18, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Yeat-orchestrate-lyrics
Song Description: The 7th track on Yeats fifth studio album, LYFESTYLE, titled ORCHESTRAT, embodies his signature vibe of luxury, success, and self-assurance. With a hypnotic, atmospheric sound, Yeat flaunts his wealth, marked by diamonds, private jets, and high-end cars, while effortlessly brushing off those who doubt him. The track pulses with braggadocio as Yeat describes living in different climates from his rivals, achieving his success without even trying.

In true Yeat style, the lyrics revolve around high-end lifestyle imagery, from extravagant club scenes to flashy cars (like a Bentley with frog eyes), while also touching on the pressures and critiques that come with fame. The repetitive hook reinforces the idea that Yeats riches and status arent just a phasetheyre the result of his unbothered, carefree approach. He boasts about being richer than their families and maintaining his dominance in this God-gifted lifestyle.

Bitch, I'm just so high, I might slide but I'm crashing it, I'm crazy
Just got a new coupe off the lot, bitch, I'm just brashing it
I been off the opiates so long, I feel like crashing it
And when she pull up on me, she suck dick, she do so passionate
Just tell me if you rock with it, tеll me if you popping it
Tell me if you еver want some cash, you know I'm dropping it
