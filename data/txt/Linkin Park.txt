Artist: Linkin Park, Alternate Names: Hybrid Theory, Xero, MMM...COOKIES
Artist Description: Hybrid Theory isn’t just the title of Linkin Park’s chart-topping debut album, but a career mission statement.

From day one, the same six players (lead vocalist Chester Bennington, drummer/percussionist Rob Bourdon, guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave ‘Phoenix’ Farrell, DJ/Programmer Joe Hahn, and keyboardist, guitarist, and co-lead vocals Mike Shinoda) built the band by fusing all their favorite styles of music into one unmistakable signature sound. With each album, Linkin Park defiantly challenges themselves and their fans by blasting into new musical territory. After setting the template for rock that incorporated hip-hop influences with Hybrid Theory and Meteora, they shifted gears completely and defied expectations with the polychromatic Minutes to Midnight, and again with the esoteric A Thousand Suns, before melding a piece of them all into 2012’s LIVING THINGS. With their 2014 release and heaviest offering in years, The Hunting Party, Linkin Park manage to capture their ever-innovative spirit with a hunger seldom seen in bands on their seventh album. One More Light (2017) is an interesting personal album, filled with a lot of emotion.

Unfortunately, on July 20, 2017, Chester unexpectedly died by suicide, shocking and saddening both fans and his own band members alike. Since then, the band have been on a hiatus with no new music except for an anniversary re-release of Hybrid Theory in 2020, an anniversary re-release of Meteora in 2023, and a singles collection, Papercuts in 2024. Both re-releases included unreleased works by the band made during album recording, and demos released on LP Underground. Papercuts, their singles collection, featured many of the band’s most popular singles over the years, while also including “Friendly Fire”, a previously unreleased song from the One More Light album sessions, and “QWERTY”, a b-side from the Minutes to Midnight album sessions that was originally released back in 2006 as a part of the LP Underground 6 album. In Hybrid Theory’s re-release, the band also uploaded the work made pre-Linkin Park — when the band was known first as Xero, and then Hybrid Theory.
It was revealed on the 5th of September 2024 that the band was starting again with Emily Armstrong, a vocalist originally from Dead Sara, and Collin Brittain following the departure of Rob Bourdon.
A new album called From Zero is expected to be released later in the year 2024.

As for the band’s name, they were originally called Hybrid Theory, but trademark issues with a band called Hybrid forced the band to rethink their name. According to Alternative Press, Bennington suggested “Lincoln Park” since he had to drive past there after band practice to get home. However, the domain name “lincolnpark.com” cost more than the band could afford so they changed the spelling to Linkin Park. It was also suggested that the name change would help them appear right next to Limp Bizkit at record stores.

Title: In the End
Release Date: October 24, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-in-the-end-lyrics
Song Description: In the End is mainly based on one persons failure.

Its most possible meaning is that its about time wasted on trying to build a relationship with a person who doesnt want to be with you.

Mike Shinoda said this about the song:

I remember putting this together in our rehearsal studio on Hollywood and Vine, working overnight in a room with no windows. I had no idea what time of day it was; I just slept when I was tired, and worked on this song until it took shape. The first guy to hear it was Rob, who told me (Im paraphrasing) that this was exactly the kind of song he wanted us to write.

During a Q&A, Chester Bennington admitted that he wasnt enthusiastic about this song:

I dont really participate in picking singles. I learnt that after making Hybrid Theory. I was never a fan of In the End and I didnt even want it to be on the record, honestly. How wrong could I have possibly been?
Lyrics:

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
It starts with one

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all

Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]

Title: One More Light
Release Date: May 19, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-one-more-light-lyrics
Song Description: One More Light is the eponymous song on this album. Mike Shinoda sat down to describe the song in an interview with Zach Sang:

The song, One More Light, was actually, its kind of sada friend of ours who worked for the label passed away. She got cancer and it was, like, really, really fast. It was super sadI was in the studio with Eg [White], and we had been talkingI told him, Dude, theres nothing else on my mind todayhe was telling me about one of his friends who had passed away, and we just got on this thing like, lets just write about itThe point of the song is that through something really, really traumaticone of the most important things you can do is to let people know that you care.

In the same interview, Mike described the tone of the song as being very acoustic, with guitar and piano sounds and no percussion. With its uplifting message of not taking your personal fortunes for granted, there exists a tenuous link between this song and Until Its Gone.

The song was debuted live on the 9th of May, 2017 in Chile during a concert. The song was posthumously dedicated to Chris Cornell during Linkin Parks performance at Jimmy Kimmel Live, who passed away the day before the album was released.

Mere months later, it was posthumously dedicated to Chester himself when he too passed away some time after the albums release.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Should've stayed, were there signs I ignored?
Can I help you not to hurt anymore?
We saw brilliance when the world was asleep
There are things that we can have but can't keep

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well, I do

[Verse 2]
The reminders pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?

Title: Heavy
Release Date: February 16, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-heavy-lyrics
Song Description: Heavy centers around the emotional weight of fixating on oneself. It is the first single from Linkin Parks seventh studio album.

Chester Bennington said in an interview with 102.7 KIIS FM, that Heavy is a song of enlightenment, where a person takes a step back and realizes that a great deal of emotional strain is self-inflicted.

The band tweeted out a clip titled Lyrics, which was released as the third link in the chain of videos that they posted during the build up to the singles release date. In the video, you can see a female part of the lyrical discussion firstly at the 3-second mark, and then towards the end where she can be heard vocalizing with Chester at around the 1:10 mark. As confirmed by Genius, the contributor is none other than Kiiara who had previously pointed out that she had been in the studio with the band.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I don't like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can't escape the gravity

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
To so much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
[Verse 2: Kiiara]
You say that I'm paranoid
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
It's not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

Title: The Emptiness Machine
Release Date: September 5, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-the-emptiness-machine-lyrics
Song Description: The Emptiness Machine is the first new Linkin Park song made since the passing of Chester Bennington in 2017. It is also the first Linkin Park song to feature Emily Armstrong as the new vocalist and Colin Brittain as the new drummer in the band.

Rumors of a new vocalist first started in April 2024 when Orgy frontman, Jay Gordon mentioned the band in an interview on Wired in the Empire, a show on KCAL 96.7:

Very, very cool guys and obviously a great band. Theyve been around a long time and theyre still going for it. Its going to be tough without Chester, but well see. I hear they got a girl singer now. Thats what I heard.

When pressed, he followed up saying, Dont quote me on that. Im not sure who the singer is going to be, but I heard it was gonna be female. They might just try to move on like that. That ought to be interesting. He would later walk back on what he said in the interview saying on social media:

With regards to this Linkin Park singer thing, I know nothing about any of that. People sure do love to take my words out of context. I love those guys and wish them the best Wow I was like what in the actual fuck ? I said nothing about knowing any of that and never brought it up. I love Chester and there will never be another him ever. Strange that that dude said something to me about it not the other way around. get real dude. Not cool!

New content was first teased by Linkin Park on August 24 2024 cryptically in the form of a countdown clock set for 100 hours on the bands website.  This first got fans speculating that a reunion and new content would be revealed when the clock hit 0. However, to many fans' surprise, the clock glitched at 0 hours and started counting upwards to 100. Many fans who continued to watch noticed the clock glitched again at the 9:05 mark, symbolizing the importance of the date, September 5th. This was later confirmed by the band when they posted to their social media Be part of something. September 5th. LinkinPark.com That same day, LP Underground members received an email inviting them to a mysterious event in LA on September 5th.

Meanwhile, the clock continued to count up to 100 and fans noticed that a mysterious image appeared when the clock reached the 99:59 mark. This left fans speculating who it was, with some guessing it was a potential new singer. When the clock finally reached 100 hours, a 3-second soundbite played, and this led to speculation that it was snippet of a new song.

Further rumors of a new song continued when a leak of The Emptiness Machines name and album artwork was revealed by Filter News, a Russian newsgroup that has been right with early leaks many times before. This leak became more viable when Linkin Park posted to their social media stories the day of the event with a link to the live stream event and the same logo that was leaked in the album artwork. This led many to believe that The Emptiness Machine would be performed at the event.

Before the September 5th event started, the thumbnail for the live stream on Linkin Parks website changed to the single artwork leaked by Filter News, confirming its legitimacy. The Emptiness Machine was finally performed by the band at the live event along with Somewhere I Belong, Crawling, In The End, and a few other old LP songs. During this performance, Mike Shinoda, Joe Hahn, and Phoenix appeared onstage along with Emily Armstrong as the new vocalist, Colin Brittain on drums, and Alex Feder filling in on guitar for Brad Delson. Linkin Park would also reveal that their 8th album,  From Zero would be released on November 15th, 2024 and a corresponding world tour would take place.

Title: Crawling
Release Date: March 1, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-crawling-lyrics
Song Description: The 5th track on Linkin Parks debut album, Hybrid Theory. It won a Grammy in 2002 for Best Hard Rock Performance.

The song alternates between rap-sung lyrics by Mike Shinoda and varied pitches of singing from Chester Bennington.

Chester claims it is hard to perform this song live due to his own personal experience similar to the problems in the song.

The music video for this song was directed by the Brother Strause and depicts a young woman portrayed by Katelyn Rosaasen and her struggles with an abusive boyfriend. The surrounding crystals represent her alienation from the world. Linkin Park is seen performing in a Fortress of Solitude-esque location. At the end of the video, the crystals are no longer seen, representing the womans escape from the relationship.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin

Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence

Song Description: Faint is from Linkin Parks second album, Meteora.

It is a crowd favourite for LP fans, and is fairly well known amongst rap fans as well, after the song was mashed up with Jigga What on their collaboration album Collision Course with Jay Z.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watchin' you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(When this began) I had nothin' to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And I've got nothin' to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Lookin' everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is lookin' at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothin' to gain, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

Like I'm close to something real

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real

Title: Good Goodbye
Release Date: April 13, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-good-goodbye-lyrics
Song Description: Linkin Parks collaboration with Pusha T and Stormzy is partially inspired by Mike Shinodas love of basketball. The song uses fouling out of a game as metaphor for the end of a relationship. Mike Shinoda also said it is an outlier track that does not fit in with the rest of the album. He described the song as sarcastic in tone and a change of pace.

On May 3, 2017, Linkin Park delivered a live performance of this song on Facebook in which Mike debuted a second verse for this song that did not make the final cut.

Lyrics:

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
(Wooh!)
Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(Don't you come back no more)
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoes
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
Gang
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Title: CASTLE OF GLASS
Release Date: December 7, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-castle-of-glass-lyrics
Song Description: One of the most influential and well known songs (certified Platinum in two countries) from Linkin Parks electronic venture, Living Things, Castle of Glass couples electronic elements with a beat that is vaguely reminiscent of country rock. The song was also used as the main theme for the 2012 video game, Medal of Honor: Warfighter which is not the first time LP have contributed to the game series, having earlier contributed the lead single from their previous album as well. The music video well exemplifies the theme of the song which is the struggle of individuals dealing with loss which is (inevitably) a result of war.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within

And your paranoia's probably worse

But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall

So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watchin' you too
Right inside your skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

[Verse 1]
I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared
But no one would listen, 'cause no one else cared
After my dreaming, I woke with this fear
What am I leaving when I'm done here?

[Pre-Chorus]
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

[Chorus]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Verse 2]
Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating, I've shared what I made
I'm strong on the surface, not all the way through
I've never been perfect, but neither have you

[Pre-Chorus]
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let somethin' shine
Goin' out of my fuckin' mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]

Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rollin' in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignorin' him?

Title: Nobody Can Save Me
Release Date: May 19, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-nobody-can-save-me-lyrics
Song Description: After the tragic death of Chester Bennington, the lyrics of this album, along with the lyrics of all their songs, seem to hold new meaning. Its very difficult to look at a song like this after the singers death and see anything but his struggle.  Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his loved ones.



  


Nobody Can Save Me is the opening track to 2017s One More Light.  Following a general theme of the album, the lyrics deal with the struggles of life.  The message comes with the realizations that the solution to these problems  and the answers to the quandaries of life  arent to be found in the external, but reside within oneself. In effect, we must act as our own guiding light. It should be noted that the original intent of the song was to be hopeful and uplifting.
Lyrics:

I'm hanging off the edge
Storm clouds gather beneath me
Waves break above my head

Tell me I'm forgiven tonight
But nobody can save me now

Song Description: This song is from the perspective of someone who is related to people they cant relate to, and wants to be in a place where people wont try to manipulate them, and can understand/sympathize with them.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors, then rapidly
You just turn around and start askin' me about
Things that you want back from me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Maybe someday, I'll be just like you and
Step on people like you do and
Run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous, but you shoulda known
That you'd wear out your welcome, and now you see
How quiet it is all alone

This version of the song is also the official League of Legends Worlds 2024 anthem, with its release date being the day before Worlds 2024 began. A separate Original Score version would be subsequently used for the Arcane: Season 2 Soundtrack. Also, sharing name with the first episode of the season.

Rumors of the song being linked to League of Legends started in early September 2024 after the official LoL account replied to a Linkin Park tweet with a crown emoji. Fans quickly interpreted it as a reference to the song title, and Mike Shinoda also hinted at the connection by replying with a fire emoji to a tweet from Arcane.

On September 21, 2024, Linkin Park further implied the collaboration when the words Make them believe  the slogan for Worlds 2024  were added at the bottom of their website upon loading. Heavy Is The Crown would finally make a surprise debut the next day when the band played it live in Hamburg, Germany as a part of the shows encore on the From Zero Would Tour. Official confirmation of the League of Legends collab would follow soon after:

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
It's pourin' in, you're laid on the floor again
One knock at the door and then
We both know how the story ends
You can't win if your white flag's out when the war begins
Aimin' so high but swingin' so low
Tryin' to catch fire but feelin' so cold
Hold it inside and hope it won't show
I'm sayin' it's not, but inside, I know

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Emily Armstrong]
Today's gonna be the day you notice
'Cause I'm tired of explainin' what the joke is

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
This is what you asked for, heavy is the crown
Fire in the sunrise, ashes rainin' down
Try to hold it in, but it keeps bleedin' out
This is what you asked for, heavy is the
Heavy is the crown

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Turn to run, now look what it's become
Outnumbered, ten to one
Back thеn should've bit your tongue
'Cause thеre's no turnin' back this path once it's begun

Title: Lost
Release Date: February 10, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-lost-lyrics
Song Description: Lost is a song from the Meteora recording sessions that was officially released on February 10th, 2023 as the first pre-release song from the 20th Anniversary Edition of Meteora.

Lost is a song that became popular in the Linkin Park fan community when the DVD of their second album Meteora was released in 2003. On The Making Of Meteora DVD that was released with Meteora, fans immediately noticed a demo that wasnt on the album which had vocals recorded for it. In this case, a five second clip of Chester singing thoughts that take away my pride, trapped in places deep inside over an instrumental has almost become legendary in the Linkin Park community and has appeared on fans' Linkin Park Underground CD wishlists for years. A lyric sheet of the song with the demo bridge can also be seen on the DVD. The words were scribbled on the Meteora art wall at one point when Linkin Park, Delta, and Frank Maddocks were making it in the summer of 2002.



The song continued to make small appearances over time, but was never released in full until 2023. In 2007, the second LPTV series was released and the episode about the Summer Sanitarium 2003 Tour features an instrumental clip of the song:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq3_obTpsaE&t=153s

Additionally, another instrumental clip was shown in an episode of LPUTV for the Linkin Park Underground titled Mikes Shirt from 2007:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQH5mdAvfyo

In the same year of 2003, in the second LPTV series, the episode about Episode 4: The Studio 2, again, features an instrumental clip of the song:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PQSoY6O-7ow&t=456s

Again, in the same year of 2003, in the second LPTV series, Episode 5: The Vocals features a small snippet/clip of the song.

The same exact clip is also featured in The Making Of Meteora:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=awG5y5CvbUc&t=1471s

The snippet itself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTQJswj5o-E

Linkin Park put up a TikTok on Febuary 5th, 2023. The video features a tape recorder that Brad found. He played a few messages from it, including a snippet of Lost. It was eventually uploaded to YouTube by Nicholas Pierson: https://m.youtube.com/shorts/HeqV2zkrHd4

Linkin Park put up a tweet with a snippet of the song and a pre-save link for the song on February, 6th, 2023: https://twitter.com/linkinpark/status/1622626200601645058
They put the same snippet on Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube.

Linkin Park also put up a teaser of the song on SoundCloud on February 6th, 2023 thats longer than the snippet on Twitter: https://soundcloud.com/linkin_park/lost-1

Linkin Park Coalition posted a different snippet from the ones on Twitter and SoundCloud: https://vk.com/lp_coalition?w=wall-8089324_350704%2Fall
It would eventually be uploaded to YouTube by Nicholas Pierson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyAr-La_UEQ

With only around fifteen songs recorded for Meteora and a growing list of Meteora-era demos appearing on the LPU CDs, it was a surprise that this song hadnt been released in some form until 2023. Until the release, its true title remained unknown and fans called it Thoughts That Take Away My Pride for twenty years due to the small clip of Chester in the DVD.

There have been quite a few interpretations of this demo from Linkin Park fans.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Just a scar somewhere down inside of me
Something I can not repair
Even though it will always be
I pretend it isn't there (This is how I feel)
I'm trapped in yesterday (Just a memory)
Where the pain is all I know (This is all I know)

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
And I'll never break away (Can't break free)
'Cause when I'm alone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm lost in these memories
Living behind my own illusion
Lost all my dignity
Living inside my own confusion

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
But I'm tired, I will always be afraid
Of the damage I've received
Broken promises they made
And how blindly I believed (This is all I know)

Title: Waiting for the End
Release Date: September 1, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-waiting-for-the-end-lyrics
Song Description: This is the second single of A Thousand Suns (2010). Waiting for the End was unlike anything theyd ever released, achieving this through Mike Shinodas reggae-esque delivery of the songs verses along with the minimal guitar distortion. The song has since been certified Platinum.

The official music video was directed by Joe Hahn, the video was nominated for Billboards 2011 Top Alternative Song and the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards Best Special Effects.

Keeping with A Thousand Suns theme of human fears, Waiting for the End appears to be Linkin Parks take on death, and the repercussions in life from it.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yo

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
This is not the end, this is not the beginnin'
Just a voice like a riot rockin' every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady, somethin' empty's within 'em
We say, "Yeah," with fists flyin' up in the air
Like we're holdin' onto somethin' that's invisible there
'Cause we're livin' at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control
Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(Oh, oh-oh) I know what it takes to move on
(Oh, oh-oh) I know how it feels to lie
(Oh) All I wanna do is trade this life for something new

I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And tryin' to figure out what it's like movin' on
And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept movin' and my mind went dead
So I'm pickin' up the pieces now, where to begin
The hardest part of endin' is startin' again (Oh-oh)

Release Date: September 28, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-one-step-closer-lyrics
Song Description: One Step Closer was the first single release off Hybrid Theory, as well as Linkin Parks very first single overall. It has become one of Linkin Parks biggest hits, being played at almost every live show, and even being the closing song for some live shows.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge

I'm about to break

Title: BURN IT DOWN
Release Date: April 16, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-burn-it-down-lyrics
Song Description: Burn It Down is a song by American rock band Linkin Park. The song was released to radio stations as well as a digital download on April 16, 2012, as the lead single from their fifth studio album Living Things. The song was written by the band and produced by co-lead vocalist Mike Shinoda and Rick Rubin, who co-produced the bands studio albums Minutes to Midnight and A Thousand Suns.

Mike Shinoda while noting that the songs meaning can be open to numerous interpretations, clarified his own:

Were talking about my personal story and his personal story, and theres also a layer of pop culture that plays a role in the lyrics of the song. For example, people build up a certain celebrity or musician or actor or whatever and theyre popular one minute and the next thing, you know either theyve done something wrong or theyve done nothing wrong and theres just a bad rumor that goes around about them and then everybodys attacking that person. Thats just the way things are. Weve actually lived through that as a band. All that stuff plays a role.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up

We can't wait to burn it to the ground

As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

You were that foundation
Never gonna be another one, no

So conditioned, I could never let go

Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid, I couldn't let myself see

Back or up, no, I hold myself
Check the rep, yep, you know mine well
Forget the rest, let them know my Hell

Kept respect up, the best, they fell
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there, sayin'

Release Date: October 24, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-by-myself-lyrics
Song Description: The song started out under the demo name Sad in 1999 and was also titled SuperXero in the time leading up to the signing of the band and the release of their debut.

This song describes a person with no self confidence as well as a drug problem.  Both of these were issues that Chester Bennington faced throughout his lifetime. The unmastered version of the album can be downloaded here.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily façade, but then
I just end up gettin' hurt again

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself
(Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone

But if I try to catch 'em, I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?
[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Don't you know!?
I can't tell you how to make it go!
No matter what I do, how hard I try!
I can't seem to convince myself why!
I'm stuck on the outside, don't you know?!
I can't tell you how to make it go!
No matter what I do, how hard I try!
I can't seem to convince myself why!
I'm stuck on the outside

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin

Title: Lying from You
Release Date: March 24, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-lying-from-you-lyrics
Song Description: Lying from You is the fourth track off of Meteora. The song was released as a radio single in early 2004 and was met with enough success to get its own live video from the Live in Texas DVD.

Lying from You shows off Chester Benningtons vocal talent that was even praised by Mike Shinoda in a track-by-track review with Shoutweb in 2003.

The booklet for Meteora offers more insight into the writing of this track:

Mike and Joes studio equipment was installed in the back of a tour bus during the summer of 2001, and they put it to good use. Mike came up with the intro sample and chorus music for the song during an overnight bus drive during Ozzfest (trying to record guitar in a moving bus can be very sloppy). But months later, in the studio at NRG, everything got cleaned up, replayed, and put together right.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealin' second after second just 'cause I know I can, but

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm lying my way from

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
You
(No, no turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you is me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I oughta be
Remember listenin' to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in

Title: Invisible
Release Date: May 12, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-invisible-lyrics
Song Description: The song was written about Mikes children. Specifically, he writes of a common fear many new parents have:  adolescence.  According to him, Invisible sends the listener to that moment when, in a parental or mentoring situation, you have to tell your kids something they dont want to hear.  While you as a parent are doing this because you love them, the children will inevitably feel you are simply being an overbearing parent.

As Mike Shinoda puts it,

I have kids, theyre all very little and I realize theyre all very strong willed. If they want something a certain way or dont want to put their socks on or they dont want to brush their teeth, theyll make life so difficult over that one little thing. I thought, Oh my God, when these kids are 16, were going to have the full-on God, I hate you, you dont understand me Slam the door, put on the headphones, and not listening to the parents.  So I thought how cool would it be to make a song and theoretically put it in a time capsule to send it to that moment in time, when they put the headphones on.

And in spite of all I should've done

I was not trying to tear you down

If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible
I won't let you feel that now

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot about yesterday, remembering
I'm pretendin' to be who I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistakes, slow to react
And even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories, even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong, I pretend that the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistakes, slow to react
So even though you're close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

Title: From the Inside
Release Date: January 12, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-from-the-inside-lyrics
Song Description: From the Inside is Linkin Parks fourth single and tenth track on their Meteora record.

Dave Phoenix Farrell came up with the original guitar idea for this song while recording with Mike in the back of the tour bus during the summer of 2002. The songs 6/8 time signature created an opportunity to juxtapose seemingly disparate rhythms, most apparent in the verses. When it came time to complete the song, the band ran into a challenge: Chester got sick. Unable to sing during his last week of scheduled recording, Chester was forced to finish his parts in New York, during the start of the mixing process. Down to the wire, the band was left with little margin for error. Fortunately, this song and Somewhere I Belong were written and recorded successfully on the third floor of Soundtrack Studios, NYC.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I don't know who to trust, no surprise
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Tryin' not to break, but I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
(I) All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Tension is building inside, steadily
Everyone feels so far away from me

Title: Sharp Edges
Release Date: May 19, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-sharp-edges-lyrics
Song Description: Despite the uplifting, poppy melody and the folk-inspired instrumentation that accompanies this song, Sharp Edges is lyrically a wistful reminiscence where Chester recounts the childhood years where he ignored his mothers sound advice.

Chester begins with the familiar advice that a lot of us have been given during childhood about not running with scissors and then expands on the metaphor in the chorus.

Chester has personally stated that this is his favorite track off the record.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Mama always told me don't you run
"Don't you run with scissors, son
You're gonna hurt someone"
Mama told me look before you leap
Always think before you speak
And watch the friends you keep

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay along the beaten path
Never listened when she said

[Chorus]
Sharp edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

[Verse 2]
Should've played it safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart
But all the things I couldn't understand
Never could've planned
They made me who I am
Put your nose in paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes

Lyrics:

Weep not for paths left alone
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end

Title: Iridescent
Release Date: September 8, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-iridescent-lyrics
Song Description: The bands fourth and final single off A Thousand Suns. Its a rock ballad about HOPE amongst chaos and sadness according to the band. This is further amplified by the song title Iridescent itself as it means the formation of rainbow-like patterns on the oil spills or soap bubbles. Since the album is based on war and machines, and rainbow is a symbol of hope, the songs motive becomes clear as in it wants to invoke feelings of positivity amidst the negativity and chaos.

Joe Hahn, the bands turntablist, who directed the video a year later said, in a one-line description of the videos concept,
In the valley of the blind, the one-eyed man is king

The song was also used as the theme song for the third Transformers film, keeping in tradition with the previous two contributions that the band has made to the franchise, namely What Ive Done and New Divide.

In addition to the official music video, Linkin Park, in association with Stars of the season released a second music video for the song which is aimed at raising awareness for pediatric oncology. Frontman Chester Bennington has also signed on as co-chair of the foundation.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
When you were standing in the wake of devastation
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
And with the cataclysm raining down, insides crying, "Save me now"
You were there, impossibly alone
[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known

And in a burst of light that blinded every angel
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of tempered grace falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known

Title: Hands Held High
Release Date: May 11, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-hands-held-high-lyrics
Song Description: Hands Held High criticizes rich men and politicians, who use their political force just to get themselves a better life. The song uses a hymn-like beat, as though it is being sung in a church.

Booklet Notes: Early in the writing process, Rick suggested the band experiment by contrasting together unexpected elements. Because the instrumental idea is known as Song Q sounded primed for melodic singing, Rick suggested the opposite be done. The songs pipe organ and marching snare proved the perfect musical bed for the two most inspired verses Mike has ever delivered.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Turn my mic up louder, I got to say somethin'
Lightweights step it aside when we come in
Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumpin'
People on the street, they panic and start runnin'
Words on loose-leaf sheet complete comin'
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme I'm dumpin'
Healing the blind, I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drummin'
Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumpin'
Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumpin'
Risk something, take back what's yours
Say somethin' that you know they might attack you for
'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have before
Like it's stupid standin' for what I'm standin' for
Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor
Like they understand you in the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughin' their way to the bank and cashin' the check
Asking you to have compassion and have some respect

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watchin' at the end of the day
In the livin' room laughin', like, "What did he say?"

Amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
In my livin' room watching, but I am not laughin'
'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen
The world is cold, the bold men take action
Have to react or get blown into fractions
Ten years old, somethin' to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound, and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me
Do you see the soldiers that are out today?
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this, you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back, he hand-wrote a quote inside
"When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die"
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
The rest of the world watchin', at the end of the day
Both scared and angry, like, "What did he say?"

[Chorus: Choir]
Amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington, Choir]
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)

Song Description: Released on November 13th 2024, two days before the release of Linkin Parks comeback record From Zero, Two Faced is the fourth single out of the album. Focusing fully in nu-metal, it is arguably one of the heaviest tracks on the record. It touches on topics such as betrayal and deceit, and it also contains references to their song One Step Closer.

Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Tryna say I'm not, but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginnin' to realize that you put me over the edge

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle

Title: Easier to Run
Release Date: March 24, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-easier-to-run-lyrics
Song Description: Easier to Run is the sixth track off of Linkin Parks second album, Meteora.

Robs playing on this track is extraordinary. He found a way to make this complex drum pattern sound easy and tasteful. Plus, he recorded it in only a few takes. On another note, the verse lyrics emerged from a free-writing exercise performed by Chester Bennington: he wrote them to no music, no beat. Mike Shinoda and Don Gilmore liked them a lot, and the guys decided this was the song to work them into.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Something has been taken from deep inside of me
A secret I've kept locked away, no one can ever see
Wounds so deep they never show, they never go away
Like moving pictures in my head, for years and years they've played

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Just washing it aside
All of the helplessness inside
Pretending I don't feel misplaced
Is so much simpler than change

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone
[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's easier to run
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made
It's easier to go
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would

Title: Good Things Go
Release Date: November 15, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-good-things-go-lyrics
Song Description: Good Things Go by Linkin Park is an emotionally resonant song that encapsulates the bands signature blend of introspection and raw energy. The track explores themes of loss, regret, and the fleeting nature of lifes most cherished moments. With hauntingly vulnerable lyrics, the song portrays a yearning to hold onto the good things that inevitably slip away.

Musically, it fuses melancholic melodies with soaring, cathartic choruses, underpinned by a mix of driving guitars and atmospheric electronics. The vocal interplay between soft, reflective verses and impassioned, anthemic refrains gives the song an intense emotional depth. Its a powerful reminder to cherish what we have while we can, delivered in the unmistakable Linkin Park style.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Emily Armstrong, Mike Shinoda & Emily Armstrong]
Feels like it's rained in my head for a hundred days
Feels like it's rained in my head for a hundred days
Stare in the mirror and I look for another face
Stare in the mirror and I look for another face
And I get so tired of puttin' out fires and makin' up lies
Checkin' my eyes for some kinda light, but nothing's inside
And it feels like it's rained in my head for a hundred days
[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
And I say I hate you when I don't
Push you when you get too close
It's hard to laugh when I'm the joke
But I can't do this on my—
Only you could save me from my lack of self-control
Sometimes bad things take the place where good things go

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Emily Armstrong, Mike Shinoda & Emily Armstrong]
I've asked for forgiveness a hundred times
I've asked for forgiveness a hundred times
Believed it myself when I halfway apologized
Believed it myself when I halfway apologized
And it's not unfair, I'm asking for prayers, but nobody cares
Goin' nowhere like fallin' downstairs while everyone stares
No one's there when I've asked for forgiveness a hundred times

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
No, I'm just takin' a shot, ah
Maybe I'm just too eager, oh
Maybe I lost the plot, ha
I used to pity some people
I said they were missing a spine
Yeah, maybe the problem is ego
Maybe the, maybe the problem is mine
Really, I'm fine
Don't get too intimate, don't get too curious
This is just feelin' like it's not that serious
Stare at the ceiling, feeling delirious
Fuck all your empathy, I want your fury
'Cause I will just
Tell you I'm better, then, better, then
Spit out my medicine, medicine, ayy
Drunk on adrenaline, 'drenaline, ayy
And I don't know why I
[Chorus: Emily Armstrong & Mike Shinoda, Emily Armstrong]
Say I hate you when I don't
Push you when you get too close
It's hard to laugh when I'm the joke
But I can't do this on my—
Only you could save me from my lack of self-control
And I won't make excuses for the pain I caused us both
So thank you for always standing by me even though
Sometimes bad things take the place where good things go7Embed

Title: Fighting Myself
Release Date: March 24, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-fighting-myself-lyrics
Song Description: Fighting Myself is a song from the Meteora recording sessions that was officially released as the second pre-release song from the 20th Anniversary Edition of Meteora. Originally scheduled for a March 3rd, 2023 release, the song was postponed to March 24th.

Fighting Myself is a song from the Meteora sessions that Linkin Park worked on, but never fully finished. It made it semi-late in the process, but was not seen on the list of 15 songs on the NRG Studios song board when the band was making the album meaning it was not in the final batch of tracks for the album. Mike Shinoda said for the Meteora 20 promotion that he remembered specifically having this song as an option for the 20th anniversary release, but his version did not have any Chester vocals on it and was just the rap verses.

The song was seen in the first LPTV Episode of Season 1 titled The Writing Process, in early 2003, when the band is recording demos at Mikes home studio. There is a clip of Mike recording the guitar riff of the song with Chester sitting next to him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uHYlklF-SM

The voice sample in the intro, verses, and bridge is Mike Shinodas voice reversed and effected combined with a vinyl static sound.

In the Linkin Park Stagelight pack from 2012, a drum beat file titled Shortcut (BPM_140_SHORTCUT_DRUM1) is included which is the drum beat from the verses of Fighting Myself. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoBYfi62k3s

Fighting Myself was debuted for the first time on Howard Stern with Mike Shinoda as a guest on February 14th, 2023, with More The Victim.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
​​​(ti stnaw eno on ,siht ot neppah reven ll'ti ,ti stnaw eno oN)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Now sometimes these thoughts in my head speak so loud
Every little thing that I think about
Just builds on top of the pain and doubt
Even though I wanna just let it out
I try to act like I don't mind it, try to keep my mouth so quiet
But sittin' there in my silence just seems to amplify it
When I thought that keepin' this inside would make it better (ti stnaw eno oN)
I never thought that I would end up ruining it forever (siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
But every time I think I got everything put back together (ti stnaw eno oN)
I end up making more regrets, making more regrets

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
Fighting myself, I always lose
Fighting myself, I always lose

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I didn't want you to think I'm worn out so easily (ti stnaw eno oN)
I wish I'd held it in so you never knew what built up inside of me (siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
Now I don't know how it overflowed, spilled out unwillingly (ti stnaw eno oN)
But now everything that I learned to hate came out for you to see
I don't want you to promise you can change everything and make it better (ti stnaw eno oN)
'Cause you can bet I'm gonna end up ruining it forever (siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
And every time you think you got everything put back together (ti stnaw eno oN)
I end up making more regrets, making more regrets

​​​(ti stnaw eno on ,siht ot neppah reven ll'ti ,ti stnaw eno oN)

[Bridge: Both, Mike Shinoda]
I can't run with this weight on my back
I can't see 'cause I'm focused on the past
I can't breathe, I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly inside me
I can't run with this weight on my back
I can't see 'cause I'm focused on the past
I can't breathe, I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly inside of me

[Outro: Chester Bennington, Both, Mike Shinoda]
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
I can't breathe, I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly inside of me
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start

Song Description: This song originally had rapping in the verses, then was re-written with singing verses during the the process at NRG The singing part remained until the recording process was finished.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Nothin' ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happenin'
It's like nothin' I could do will distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
'Cause from the infinite words I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
But didn't realize instead of settin' it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Never goes away
Never goes away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And now you've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me (You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Hearin' your name, the memories come back again
I remember when it started happenin'
I'd see you in every thought I had and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committin' myself to 'em and every day
I regret sayin' those things 'cause now I see that I
Took what I hated and made it a part of me

Title: Halfway Right
Release Date: May 19, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-halfway-right-lyrics
Song Description: A song sung by Chester Bennington with no (or very little) background support from Mike Shinoda or any other band member, Halfway Right is a half and half track itself. Partly an account of Chesters problematic adolescent years and partly a letter from the present day adult to the traumatized 7 year old, the song openly discusses the substance abuse issues that Chester has faced.

Accompanied by a laid back hip-hop beat, and Rob Bourdons drumming, LPs chief vocalist lays bare the dark and gritty reality of drug abuse.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right

[Verse 1]
Used to get high with the dead-end kids
Abandoned houses where the shadows lived
I never been higher than I was that night
I woke up driving my car
I couldn't see then what I see right now
The road dissolving like an empty vow
Couldn't remember where I'd been that night
I knew I took it too far

[Pre-Chorus]
All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

[Chorus]
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right (Halfway right)

Told me, "Kid, you're going way too fast
You burn too bright, you know you'll never last"

I just laughed because what do they know?
Here I am, standing all alone
Because I took it too far

All you said to do was slow down

Title: Forgotten
Release Date: October 24, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-forgotten-lyrics
Song Description: Forgotten is one of the very first songs the band ever wrote. Formerly known as Rhinestone, it was featured along with three other tracks on the Xero demo tape (recorded in 1996), back when Mark Wakefield was the lead singer. It is the only song from this tape that has been later reworked with new lyrics and used in an album.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
There's a place so dark, you can't see the end
(Skies cock back) And shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut, lookin' through the rust and rot, and dust
A small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open, and it's dark again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

In the memory, you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Movin' all around, screamin' of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps
Behind street lamps, chain-link, and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
And the memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you

Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly

In the memory, you will find me

Title: Final Masquerade
Release Date: June 9, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-final-masquerade-lyrics
Song Description: The heart-bleeding eleventh and penultimate track on Linkin Parks sixth studio album, The Hunting Party, is a nostalgic callback to a brighter and more systematic time in rock music: the mid 2000s.

The song features a markedly slower tempo and lighter than many of the rest of the album. The band is also breaking their tradition of including an instrumental track as their penultimate track, seen on their first two albums and Living Things. (Cure for the itch, Session, Tinfoil).

In a special Tweeting session, it was revealed by co-vocalist Mike Shinoda that the original version of this song had him singing all the way through, but later they decided to go with Chester.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Tearing me apart with the words you wouldn't say
And suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away
'Cause I don't have a reason, and you don't have the time
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find

[Chorus]
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade, the final masquerade

[Verse 2]
All I ever wanted, the secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak
'Cause I can't see forgiveness, and you can't see the crime
And we both keep on waitin' for what we left behind

[Chorus]
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

Title: Runaway
Release Date: October 24, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-runaway-lyrics
Song Description: Runaway is the 6th track on Linkin Parks debut album Hybrid Theory.

Basically, it describes what someone can feel when he or she feels that is tortured by society and simply decides to escape.

The song didnt receive good criticism because some people consider it to be a song written for teenagers, and, as many can notice, it has a similar structure to Crawling, with very short raps from Mike.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Graffiti decorations under a sky of dust
A constant wave of tension on top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me, I learned were never true

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action, these words were never true

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

Title: The Messenger
Release Date: September 8, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-the-messenger-lyrics
Song Description: The Messenger is the fifteenth and final track off the album, A Thousand Suns. It serves as a distinct closer to the album, removing the electronic influence prevalent in the rest of the songs and providing a positive theme as opposed to the cynical themes most of the other songs. After the string of criticism of the world in the preceding 14 tracks, The Messenger offers a glimmer of hope at the end of the tunnel in love.

The Messenger was the only acoustic piece ever written by the band before the acoustic version of Final Masquerade was released in February 2015. On February 22, 2011, at a pre-show backstage press conference in San Jose, CA, Chester said that he wrote the song for his children, saying that they were growing up and things may get tough, but that he would always love them.

The songs instrumentation features no percussion or bass, and is largely only guitar, with a piano entering in the second verse and a harmonium in the second chorus.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
When you feel you're alone, cut off from this cruel world
Your instincts telling you to run
Listen to your heart, those angel voices
They'll sing to you, they'll be your guide back home

[Chorus]
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind, it keeps us kind

[Verse 2]
When you've suffered enough and your spirit is breaking
You're growing desperate from the fight
Remember you're loved and you always will be
This melody will bring you right back home

[Chorus]
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]

The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

Who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]

Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away

Title: Nobody’s Listening
Release Date: March 24, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-nobodys-listening-lyrics
Song Description: With the main sample being a Japanese bamboo flute, Nobodys Listening has a very different atmosphere from the rest of the songs on Meteora.
It also samples High Voltage, a song from the original Hybrid Theory EP released in 1999 when the band was still called Hybrid Theory.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Com-com-com-com-comin' at you
Com—, at you, com-comin' at you

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yo, peep the style and the kids checkin' for it
The number one question is "How could you ignore it?"
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
With raps that got you backin' this up like "Rewind that"
We're just rollin' with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life livin'
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven
But in the meantime, there are those
Who wanna talk this and that, so I suppose
That it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreadin' the dirt, it ​goes

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
Try to give you warning
But everyone ignores me

Handful of anger held in my chest

Guessin' that it's better I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me somethin' to write on
The pain gave me somethin' I could set my sights on
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears
The uphill struggle over years, the fear
And trash-talkin' and the people it was to
And the people that started it, just like you

Title: Don’t Stay
Release Date: March 24, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-dont-stay-lyrics
Song Description: This track is a subliminal diss aimed at their old label management  who tried to destroy them.
Some songs where Mike talks about this are: Get Me Gone, High Road and Hit The Floor. Their old label tried to tell Mike that he should not rap and should just play keyboard and then some guy at the label tried to claim he wrote all their songs.
Many of the tracks off this album are disses aimed at their label.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes, I need you to stay away from me
Sometimes, I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow, I need you to go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda & Both]
(Don't stay) Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and don't stay
Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and don't stay

Sometimes, I feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes, I just feel like screaming at myself
Sometimes, I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow, I need to be alone

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Emily Armstrong]
This is the letter that I, I didn't write
Lookin' for color in the black and white
Skyscrapers we created on shaky ground
And I'm tryin' to find my patience

But you won't let me breathe
And I'm not ever right
All we are is talkin'
Over each other
There's nothin' underneath
It's all a waste of time
All we are is talkin'
Over each other (Over each other)
Over each other

[Verse 2: Emily Armstrong]
Reaching for satellites, but all along
Under your breath, you're sayin' that I was wrong, oh
The skyscrapers we created are comin' down
And free-fallin' to the pavement

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
'Cause you won't let me breathe
And I'm not ever right

Title: Looking For An Answer (Live 2017)
Release Date: October 28, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-looking-for-an-answer-live-2017-lyrics
Song Description: Looking For An Answer is a song that Mike Shinoda wrote following the tragic passing of bandmate Chester Bennington. He and the rest of Linkin Park debuted this song live at their tribute concert to celebrate the life of Chester on October 27, 2017, at the Hollywood Bowl.

The song is a look into the raw emotion that Shinoda, and likely the rest of the band, felt following Benningtons death on July 20, 2017. Shinoda uses the verses to express the pain he felt, while Mike questions if there was anything he could have done to prevent Chesters death in the chorus.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
There's an emptiness tonight
A hole that wasn't there before
And I keep reaching for the light
But I can't find it anymore
There's an emptiness tonight
A heavy hand that pulls me down
They say it's gonna be alright
But can't begin to tell me how

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I ask myself out loud...

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Have I been lost all along?
Was there something I could say, or something I should not have done?
Was I lost all along?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Is there sunshine where you are?
The way there was when you were here
'Cause I'm just sitting in the dark
In disbelief that this is real
In disbelief that this is real

Title: When They Come for Me
Release Date: September 1, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-when-they-come-for-me-lyrics
Song Description: On When They Come For Me, Mike Shinoda brings that classic addressing the haters flow, while proclaiming that they are no longer the same band that made Hybrid Theory.
It is worth noting that this song contains the highest amount of profanity in any Linkin Park song to date.
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, I am not a pattern to be followed
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow
I'm not a criminal, not a role model
Not a born leader, I'm a tough act to follow
I am not the fortune and the fame
Nor the same person tellin' you to forfeit the game
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain
And I found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems
And it seems ugly, but it can get worse
'Cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
'Cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
And I'm not a robot, I'm not a monkey
I will not dance even if the beat's funky
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk
Y'all oughtta stop talkin', start tryin' to catch up, motherfucker

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
You're too ignorant to fail, I can't look you in the eye
And I can't even tell if you've been tellin' me a lie

Reckless like you're makin' rockets just to blow up in the sky
Feelin' like it's chemical, all under my skin like it's medical
Stuck on repetitions that are only hypothetical
Actin' like the truth and your opinion are identical

Title: The Little Things Give You Away
Release Date: May 14, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-the-little-things-give-you-away-lyrics
Song Description: This is the closing track from Linkin Parks third studio album Minutes to Midnight. This song is allegedly about the devastation wreaked on New Orleans by the hurricane Katrina and how the Bush administration did not do enough, indeed according to some views  nothing at all to help the people of the community.
This whole album marked a departure from the style Linkin Park had portrayed in their earlier albums and this song is just another example of that. Rather than heavy riffs and vocal screams, this song has vocal harmonizing, prominent use of acoustic and electric guitars, rhythmic syncopation and a vocal centric aesthetic. The last one is not much of a difference. Just a very obvious characteristic.
Not the most famous from the album, but nonetheless, a hard hitting one.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]

Don't wanna reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you

And now there will be no mistakin'
The levees are breakin'

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater

Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares

Title: My December
Release Date: November 28, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-my-december-lyrics
Song Description: One of Linkin Parks earliest experiments with softer rock, My December was conceived after the release of their debut, Hybrid Theory. The song was first released as the B-side for One Step Closer alongside another little known LP track, High Voltage, afterwards both High Voltage and My December were released as bonus tracks for the Japanese and European editions of Hybrid Theory and their debut DVD, Frat Party at the Pankake Festival.

Lyrically, the song carries a very dark tone and was primarily composed by Mike Shinoda. The song was recorded between live tours of Hybrid Theory. The point-of-view character in the song seems to express a deep yearning to return to a normal low-key life in exchange for giving up their current life of being constantly in the public eye.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
This is my snow-covered home
This is my December
This is me, alone

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things
That I said to you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away

(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things
That I said to you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to
Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I used the deadwood to make the fire rise
The blood of innocence burning in the skies
I filled my cup with the risin' of the sea
And poured it out in an ocean of debris
Oh

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm swimming in the smoke of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve, what I don't deserve

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
We held our breath when the clouds began to form
But you were lost in the beating of the storm
And in the end, we were made to be apart
Like separate chambers of the human heart
No

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm swimming in the smoke of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve
It's in the blackened bones of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve, what I don't deserve

Title: Wretches and Kings
Release Date: September 8, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-wretches-and-kings-lyrics
Song Description: From 2010 album A Thousand Suns (title 10) and the songs which features the Bodys upon gears-speech by Mario Savio.

A Thousand Suns concerns nuclear war & the end of the world.
Wretches and Kings is about the social aspect of the end  the total control of persons or groups

The beat:
The significant guitar was made by:
1. recording various lines from the guitar
2. slicing it up
3. doing the heavy disortion
4. playing the beat via MPC

The whole song brings an aggressive feeling to the listener.
It is about control (groups claiming power) and people getting deceived and manipulated.
It calls for resistance!
Lyrics:

[Intro: Mario Savio]
There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part, you can't even passively take part
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus and you've got to make it stop

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
To save face, how low can you go?
Talk a lotta game but yet you don't know
Static on the way, make us all say, "Woah"
The people up top push the people down low
Get down and obey every word
Steady gettin' mine if you haven't yet heard
Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd
Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt
If you haven't heard yet, then I'm lettin' you know
There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload
And no one make a move unless my people say so
Got everything outta control, now everybody go

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Steel unload, final blow
We, the animals, take control

So keep pace, how slow can you go
Talk a lotta shit and yet you don't know
Fire on the way, make you all say, "Whoa"
The people up top and the people down low
Get down, and I'm runnin' it like that
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at
Somewhere in between the kick and the hi-hat
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact
So get with the combat, I'm lettin' 'em know
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down, no
So push the button, let the whole thing blow
Spinnin' everything outta control, now everybody go

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Steel unload, final blow
We, the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings, we come for you
Steel unload, fire blow
Filthy animals, beat them low
Skin and bone, black and blue
No more this sun shall beat onto you
[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
From the front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high

If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high

If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high

[Outro: Mario Savio]
When the operation of the machine becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part, you can't even passively take part
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus and you've got to make it stop
And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it
That unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all10Embed

Title: Hit the Floor
Release Date: March 24, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-hit-the-floor-lyrics
Song Description: Hit The Floor is the fifth track on Linkin Parks second studio album, Meteora.

Booklet Notes: The band wanted make a heavy song with a hip hop bounce  this is what came out. Mike and Chester tried numerous singing style choruses, but when Chester brought the screaming hook into the studio, everyone knew it was going to work. The hardest work in creating this song was in the minor details. Tightening the lyrics and capturing the performances took days to finish.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me
Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind, afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around
You think havin' the upper hand means you gotta keep puttin' me down
But I've had too many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
So I'm waitin' until the upper hand is mine

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Makin' your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Makin' your heart stop
You think you won, and then it's all gone

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
So many people like me put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on
There are so many things you say that make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall, and I'm countin' down the time
'Cause I've had so many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
So I'm waitin' until the upper hand is mine

Replaced freedom with fear, you trade money for lives

No, no more sorrow

Your time is borrowed

Song Description: The song is about separation from a loved one  and thus having to spend Valentines day in solitude.
Other themes of the song include burial and death, and therefore there is some ambiguity as to whether the person whose POV this song is from has been separated from their loved one, or whether their loved one has died.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
My insides all turned to ash, so slow
And blew away as I collapsed, so cold
A black wind took them away from sight
And held the darkness over day that night

[Refrain]
And the clouds above move closer, lookin' so dissatisfied
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

[Verse 2]
I used to be my own protection, but not now
'Cause my path has lost direction somehow
A black wind took you away from sight
And held the darkness over day that night

[Refrain]
And the clouds above move closer, lookin' so dissatisfied
And the ground below grew colder as they put you down inside
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face
All the lies, how they cut so deeply
You can't get enough, you take
And take and take and never say

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You say that it's not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breakin'
You run but then back, you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're makin'
You can't get enough, you take
And take, and take, and take, and take
Fuck it, are you listening?

Floating down as colors fill the light
We look up from the ground in fields of paper white

We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go

Title: Guilty All the Same
Release Date: March 5, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-guilty-all-the-same-lyrics
Song Description: The third track on Linkin Parks sixth studio album, The Hunting Party, Guilty All the Same is about how people like to play the blame game and point out mistakes in others and make them feel guilty while they themselves are not perfect and everybody is guilty of something.

Rakim is, unexpectedly, on this track and drops a very lyrical verse. Yet, just another rock / rap collaboration in a while, and its not first one for Linkin Park
Lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Tell us all again what you think we should be
What the answers are, what it is we can't see
Tell us all again how to do what you say
How to fall in line, how there's no other way

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
But oh-oh, we all know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Show us all again, that our hands are unclean
That we're unprepared, that you have what we need
Show us all again, 'cause we cannot be saved
'Cause the end is near, now there's no other way

There's no one else to blame, guilty all the same

[Post-Chorus]
Guilty all the same
You're guilty all the same

[Bridge: Rakim]
Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of bein' rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split, nonsense
It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
At anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowin' as soon as the dough or the deal peak
Say it's time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to gain
Drained, manipulated like artists, it's real deep
Until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock 'til pop and radio
And record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be?
You feel me, we'll see
That green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
TV or a name, the Media, the game
To me you're all the same, you're guilty
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame, guilty all the same

[Post-Chorus]
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same

Title: IN MY REMAINS
Release Date: June 20, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-in-my-remains-lyrics
Song Description: Bennington sings of fear and pain over an electronic, aggressive, full sonic landscape; discordant and clangy. It shifts to a precise, military rat-a-tat as Shinoda sings Like an army falling, one by one. He repeats the phrase as the tension builds and Rob Bourdons drumming propels everything into lockstep
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Separate
Sifting through the wreckage, I can't concentrate
Searching for a message in that fear and pain
Broken down and waiting for the chance to feel alive

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Come apart
Falling in the cracks of every broken heart
Digging through the wreckage of your disregard
Sinking down and waiting for the chance to feel alive

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

Song Description: In Pieces is the second to last track off of Linkin Parks third studio album Minutes to Midnight.

Booklet Notes:

This song began as a keyboard and beat loop, along with the staccato guitar in the second verse. In that early form. Chester put down a rough vocal, with words that came relatively effortlessly. The vocals that appeared in those early stages remained virtually unchanged throughout the growth of the song.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Telling me to go
But hands beg me to stay
Your lips say that you love
Your eyes say that you hate

So I, I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this in pieces

Pretend you're spotless, but I don't wash away

Title: Casualty
Release Date: November 15, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-casualty-lyrics
Song Description: The band began working on Casualty rather late into the From Zero sessions. At this point in the bands return, Brad was still hesitant to return to the studio and begin working on music again, even though he knew that sessions were happening between Mike, Dave, Joe, Emily, and Colin. They kept the door open for him, not pressuring him to join back but also expressing the value in his perspective. Once he finally entered the studio, he was fully on board and, according to Mike, said I think we can write something heavier. Like, way heavier.

Emily wrote the lines in the chorus, surprising Mike with the intensity of her delivery. Emily said she took inspiration from her live performances with Dead Sara when performing on the track.

This track was premiered on November 8th, 2024 at their show in Arlington, Texas
Lyrics:

[Intro: Emily Armstrong]
Let me out, set me free
I know all the secrets you keep
I, I won't be
I won't be your casualty
(Launch me up high)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I got too complacent
Bleached in the eyes
Put through the paces
But I got left behind

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Emily Armstrong]
But I'm not runnin'
'Cause something's comin'
It's only a matter of time

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Let me out, set me free
I know all the secrets you keep
I, I won't be
I won't be your casualty

Title: Friendly Fire
Release Date: February 23, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-friendly-fire-lyrics
Song Description: Friendly Fire was a song that was originally written for the 2017 Linkin Park studio album One More Light by Mike, Brad, and Jon Green. The title was first seen on a song board in a picture Joe Hahn posted on September 6th, 2016 alongside songs that made the album.



Brad with One More Light song board with song titles

Following the release of One More Light, Mike said he would try to get demos and studio content that didnt make the album out to fans because there is some cool stuff. Brad Delson added, Theres definitely a few gems that weve got in our back pocket. But I would say the vast majority of those songs fortunately will never see the light of day. They were just a part of the journey; the ones that were the most satisfying and exciting were the ones we ultimately focused on and finished and make up the album.

On February 19th, 2024, a snippet of Friendly Fire would be put out, revealing the song as the 20th track in the tracklisting of Papercuts  Singles Collection 2000-2023.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Tell me the words I've forgotten
What we were fighting for
Staring right into the darkness
Through an empty open door

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Can't put back what's been broken
Can't change the moment
We went too far

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're pullin' apart for no reason
We're pullin' a trigger in a useless war
And if we come back and go into the black (Black)
What are we fighting for?
What are we fighting for?

I was supposed to protect you
No matter what's to come

Title: POWERLESS
Release Date: June 20, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-powerless-lyrics
Song Description: The song is very reminiscent of Chesters side project, Dead By Sunrise. The song was written by co-lead vocalist Mike Shinoda and producer Rick Rubin. This is the only Linkin Park song that is in the time signature of 7/8 (sans the chorus). Its working title was Tinfoil, which now serves as the intro to this song. The songs lyrics detail a self-destructive friend or lover.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You hid your skeletons when I had shown you mine
You woke the devil that I thought you'd left behind
I saw the evidence, the crimson soaking through
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

[Chorus]
And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side, powerless

[Verse 2]
I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end
I'm left with emptiness that words cannot defend
You'll never know what I became because of you
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

[Chorus]
And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side, powerless

Song Description: The energetically-charged second track on Linkin Parks sixth studio album, The Hunting Party.
Features guest vocals from Page Hamilton of Helmet.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah
Ah, so what'cha waitin' for, anticipatin' more
While you debate what it could take to instigate a war?
Yeah, I been hated more than time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fuckin' say they didn't say before
But you could never see it, your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe, but this is take a shot time
While you're waitin' for a purpose, I already got mine
While you tell me step to it like "one, two, three, four"

[Chorus: Page Hamilton & Chester Bennington]
And if I do what you demand (You say)
You'll let me understand (You say)
You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away (You say)
I'll have no debt to pay (You say)
I'm gonna get what I deserve, woah-oh-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Page Hamilton]
Your word, obeyed
My debt, repaid
Our trust, betrayed
All for nothing, all for nothing

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Kick back, there's no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for ya, I really don't know ya
You talk, but let me show you where to put your paranoia
You're jokin', I don't have a half a sucker bone to throw you
I'm disgusted, wonder what could've made you tuck your tail below you
And no, I'm not your soldier, I'm not takin' any orders
I'm a five-star general infantry controller
Need a lesson? Let me show you, have you checkin' your composure
While I make you step to it like "one, two, three, four"?

Title: She Couldn’t
Release Date: August 13, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-she-couldnt-lyrics
Song Description: She Couldnt is a demo song recorded in 1999 by Linkin Park (back then known as Hybrid Theory) which featured a sample of B-Boy Document 99 by Mos Def, Mad Skillz and High and Mighty. The song was previously leaked through the Linkin Park fan-website Linkin Park Live after a promo CD that featured the song was found on eBay; in 2009, Mike Shinoda talked about its discovery on his blog:

Many of you have asked about an old demo that is floating around. The song is called She Couldnt. We did it in 1999 while working on Hybrid Theory [the bands 2000 debut album, ndr], but it never made it on an album and has never been published by us. For legal reasons, thats all I can say about the song, but I hope this clears up the matter!

You can read an in-depth history about the discovery of the song at Linkinpedia here!

Linkin Park officially released the song on August 13th, 2020, as a promotional song for the 20th Anniversary Edition of Hybrid Theory.

Title: In Between
Release Date: May 14, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-in-between-lyrics
Song Description: In Between is the tenth track off of Minutes to Midnight, Linkin Parks third studio release.
Its one of the 2 songs (the other is No Roads Left, found in the deluxe version of the album) in which Mike provides solo vocals.
booklet notes: Rick encouraged the band to lay rough vocals on their demos as early as possible, believing that sometimes a sparse song can become great with the right vocal melody. In Between is a perfect example. Even with just Mikes vocals and a bass line, this song remained on the bands Favorites list, as many songs with a lot more production were voted off the album.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say
But tryin' to be genuine was harder than it seemed
And somehow I got caught up in between

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say
But tryin' to be someone else was harder than it seemed
And somehow I got caught up in between

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Between my pride and my promise
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I wanna say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that's worse than one is none

Let me apologize for what I'm about to say

Means finding it alone

Title: Keys to the Kingdom
Release Date: June 13, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-keys-to-the-kingdom-lyrics
Song Description: Keys to the Kingdom opens with an affected, robotic-sounding voice yelling and then manages to make some disjointed-sounding riffs work. I wanted you to listen to the song and be disrupted at regular intervals, Shinoda says. I wanted that to be jarring or distracting, just kind of fuck you up.

This approach was especially difficult for drummer Rob Bourdon who ran himself ragged trying to keep up with the music. Its probably the hardest stuff hes ever played on one of our albums, Shinoda says. He had to physically work his way up to it. He had to go running, lift weights, work with a trainer. Then with a laugh, Shinoda says, He eventually went to a chiropractor because he threw his back out playing drums. I dont want to put the guy in the hospital, but it was fun for both of us to make something that was challenging to him. And he definitely feels that at the end of the day, hes a better drummer for it.

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
No control, no surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility
Ah, da-da, da-da

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
We start the final war
Tell me what's worth fighting for when we know there's nothing more
We take the hand or fist
Just to sell ourselves for this, the path we least resist

Got a different method, but I still can bring the pain, so

Title: High Voltage (B-Side Rarities)
Release Date: January 15, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-high-voltage-b-side-rarities-lyrics
Song Description: This was one of the tracks that helped launch Linkin Park, via their Hybrid Theory EP. It encapsulates their Nu-Metal sound, with Shinoda rapping and speaking frankly about the criticism the genre receives. Its almost a plea for the band to be taken seriously, as if they could predict the hate storm that would descend on Nu-Metal.

The way he does this is by spinning adept rhymes that lyrically lay waste to any potential competition, confirming that Linkin Park would outlast the commercial success of the genre. It turns out he was right, although theyd never again match their achievements from the early 2000s.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Lee Cadena, Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
"You know what I mean?
You could put a label on a life
Put a label on a lifestyle." (Sometimes)
"You know, put a label on how you wake up every morning
And go to bed at night." (Hybrid)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I've been diggin' into crates, ever since I was livin' in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and big bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic so I could start blessin' it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords to double-helixes
And show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast a spell of instrumental-ness on all of you MCs who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones
I firebomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit, with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

(Akira)
I put a kick in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Sprayin' bright day over what you might say
My blood type's Krylon, Technicolor Type-A
On highways, bright with road rage
Pages of wind in cages of tin that bounce all around
(Surround sound) Devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings, overall the same thing
Sing-song karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away with a pencil pistol official
Sixteen-line, the rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws
Spittin' rah blah blah blah, you can say you saw

"And like the rock and rap, you know what I mean?
People actin' like, you know, 'Wow, that's a new invention!'

It is constantly changing." (Sometimes)
"There's a lot of change
Everybody's always tryna to put labels on…
There ain't no label for this shit
They always gonna try to put a label on it
Try to create somethin' so they could water it down"

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood, under the gun like a new disease
Sometimes, I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood, under the gun like a new disease

Title: UNTIL IT BREAKS
Release Date: June 20, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-until-it-breaks-lyrics
Song Description: Until It Breaks is primarily a Mike song in which he raps about his feelings for the competition and the critics while displaying his lyrical mastery with extended metaphors and wordplay.

The song is unique in many ways. Its the only Linkin Park song that features lead guitarist Brad Delson on vocals, who sings the melodic outro.

Another notable aspect of the song is that it can be divided into three parts, which initially had been their own songs, as seen on LPU XIII. The first part is Mike rapping to a dubstep beat followed by Chester singing a bridge over a piano part. (The demo was Apaches). The second part is Mike rapping again but to a faster beat. (The demo was Foot Patrol). The third and last part is Brad singing a soft outro. Mike starts singing the harmony in the middle of that part. (The demo was Three Band Terror).
Lyrics:

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
It goes a one, two, three

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when a competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run
My mama taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I put 'em both together, now tell me what I got, it's
A pretty smart weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it like that

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
It ain't over 'cause the shark's on the left side, the snake's on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in, nothing really fights
And as for me, I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you can try to fill my shoes
But steady, little soldier, I ain't standin' next to you
I'd be layin' on the ground before you're even in my view like that

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]

It's something for your people on the block to black out and rock to
Give me what you need like Poppa, who shot you?

You're meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on a dime, quick-witted
Y'all quit trippin', I don't have time for your cryin'
I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firin' squad or are you in the lineup?
Bang, bang, little monkey man, playin' with the big guns
Only get you slain, I ain't playin', I'm just sayin'
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake, shake down, money, here's the breakdown
You can play the bank, I'mma play the bank takedown
And no mistakes now, I'm comin' to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a brainwash
Get the picture? It's like that

We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks

So rest your head, it's time to sleep
And dream of what's in store

Title: A Line in the Sand
Release Date: June 13, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-a-line-in-the-sand-lyrics
Song Description: The final track from The Hunting Party by Linkin Park features guitar work very identical to Victimized.
Mike Shinoda has stated that this song is among his favorites on the album as it encapsulates the essence of Linkin Park in one song.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns, we laughed at it all
And when they, they told us to go
We paid them no mind like every other time, but little did we know

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
Today, I looked for a sign with flames in my hands
A line in the sand between yours and mine
And it came like fire from below
Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall, but little did you know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours and face your crime
You'll tell them, "Give me back what's mine, give me back what's mine!"

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I'd never been a coward, I'd never seen blood
You'd sold me an ocean and I was lost in the flood
We were countin' on a leader, we were driven by need
But couldn't take temptation, and we were blinded by greed
You were steady as a sniper, we were waitin' on a wire
So we never saw it comin' when you ran from the fire
You can try intimidation, and you can try to ignore
But when the time comes callin', yeah, you are gonna get yours

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And so today, your truth has come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours, you're out of time
And you will give me back what's mine, give me back what's mine

[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Give me, give me back what's mine
Give me, give me back what's mine, what's mine
Give me, give me back what's mine, what's mine, what's mine
Give me back what's mine!

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]

Stars are slipping down, glistening
And I'm tryin' not to think what I'm leaving now
No deceiving now

It's time you let me know
Let me know

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone

Into winter now, bittersweet
And 'cross that horizon, this sun is setting down
You're forgetting now

Title: Robot Boy
Release Date: September 8, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-robot-boy-lyrics
Song Description: This song appears as the sixth track on A Thousand Suns. It is one of the most layered vocal recordings of Linkin Park to date, with three-part harmonies, Mike and Chester singing (it is possible that another band member might have also contributed vocals as well) and ad-libbing at the end. There are well over ten vocal tracks total. It is also heavily layered with synths, featuring a synth solo at the end.

The song deals with a speaker feeling effectively emotionless because of the way people have treated him. The song ends with an anthem of consolation, to hold on.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
You say you're not gonna fight 'cause no one will fight for you
And you think there's not enough love and no one to give it to
And you're sure you've hurt for so long, you've got nothing left to lose
So, you say you're not gonna fight 'cause no one will fight for you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
You say the weight of the world has kept you from letting go (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And you think compassion's a flaw and you'll never let it show (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And you're sure you've hurt in a way that no one will ever know (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But someday the weight of the world will give you the strength to go (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Title: Cure for the Itch
Release Date: October 24, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-cure-for-the-itch-lyrics
Song Description: Cure for the Itch holds the distinction of being the only song performed solely by one member of the group.  Joe Hahn, the bands DJ, spins and scratches over complex and often unpredictable drum programming.

The title, Cure for the Itch can be viewed as having two meaning.  A craving is often described as an itch when the cure is related to drugs, sex, or even music.

Alternately, one scratches an itch just as Joe Hahn scratches to create this incredible instrumental. A music video was created for the song of just Hahns scratches.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6z5U83lfrQ

The song was sampled on a later Linkin Park song with Black Thought on vocals titled X-Ecutioner Style."

Title: Wisdom, Justice, and Love
Release Date: September 8, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-wisdom-justice-and-love-annotated
Song Description: The uplifting eleventh track on Linkin Parks fourth studio album A Thousand Suns serves as a prelude to Iridescent.

The track samples an inspiring speech delivered by the great political activist Martin Luther King Jr., entitled A Time to Break Silence. The speech, delivered by Luther King on April 4, 1967 at the Riverside Church in New York City, questioned the humanity of the Vietnam War and all war in general.

As the speech goes on, Martin Luther Kings voice gets more and more distorted until its barely recognizable compared to the original voice.
Lyrics:

[Interlude: Martin Luther King, Jr.]
I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight
Because my conscience leaves me no other choice
A true revolution of values will lay hand on the world order and say of war
This way of settling differences is not just
"This business of burning human beings with napalm
Of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows
Of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane
Of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
"Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
"Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
"Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"

Title: Wastelands

Song Description: The sixth track on Linkin Parks sixth studio album, The Hunting Party, Wastelands continues the displeasure Linkin Park have towards the degrading state of rock.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Ah
This is war with no weapons, marchin' with no steppin'
Murder with no killin', illin' every direction
First, no sequel, do the math, no equal
John with no Yoko; more power, less people
And no, I'm not afraid of that, print it in your paperback
Every rap is made in fact to act as a delayed attack
Every phrase a razor blade that's saved until they play it back
To slay and leave 'em layin' on the pavement, bang, fade to black

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the wastelands of today when there's nothing left to lose
And there's nothing more to take, but you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away and your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Roll credits, you get it, the show is done
They're talkin' for just talkin', but meaning, they got none
None of 'em come proper, they talk like a shotgun
But how many got bred with integrity? Not one
So no, I'm not afraid to see you suckers hold a blade to me
Ain't no way to shake the ground I built before you came to be
Take it how you take it, I'm the opposite of vacancy
And this is not negotiation, y'all can hate and wait and see

Release Date: April 7, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-more-the-victim-lyrics
Song Description: More The Victim is a song from the Meteora recording sessions that was officially released from the 20th Anniversary Edition of Meteora.

More The Victim was one of the 15 songs that made it to the end of the sessions for Meteora in 2002. On the bands song board at NRG Studios, its demo title, Cumulus, was seen as the very first song on the board that Linkin Park was working on.

In 2013, Linkin Park released Cumulus, an instrumental demo, on the LP Underground XIII CD. In the booklet, Mike Shinoda wrote: We tried many times to make this song work, but it always seemed too poppy for the album(s) we were currently working on.

The existence of More The Victim, the vocal version of the song was revealed for the first time in the Meteora 20 tracklist.

The instrumental on More The Victim is an evolved form of Cumulus, with a slightly different sample pattern, a different guitar part, live drums, strings, scratching, and
more.

Words that Chester spray-painted on the Meteora art wall of somebody angry broken are from the bridge of More The Victim. It was first seen in  The Making Of Meteora.

It can also be seen in the Meteora booklet.

It would also be further shown in pictures of the Meteora art wall in unreleased photo proofs that can be seen when you click on the art wall in the warehouse on Linkin Parks website.



More The Victim was debuted for the first time on Howard Stern with Mike Shinoda as a guest on February 14th, 2023, with Fighting Myself.

The song is written by Mike Shinoda about a story told to him by Chester Bennington about a person who was hurt but wanted to always to seem the one with the most pain and Chester expressed his anger towards this person. All this was revealed in his interview with Howard Stern on Febuary 14th, 2023. https://youtu.be/245si_wNDuQ

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington, both]
I've been diggin' into crates ever since I was livin' in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic so I could start blessin' it
And chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords to double-helixes
And show them what I'm made of

Cast the spell of instrumental-ness on all of the MC's that hate us
So try on, (Try it) leave you without a shoulder to cry on

I tried threats, but moved on to a promise

Song Description: J. Robert Oppenheimer describes the first successful test of a nuclear weapon by the US Army on July 16, 1945.

Lyrics:

[J. Robert Oppenheimer]
We knew the world would not be the same
Few people laughed
Few people cried
Most people were silent
I remember the line from The Hindu Scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita
Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty
And, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says:
"Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"
I suppose we all thought that, one way or anotherSee Linkin Park LiveGet tickets as low as $

Title: Enth E Nd
Release Date: July 30, 2002, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-enth-e-nd-lyrics
Song Description: Enth E Nd is the official remix of Linkin Parks In the End. Enth E Nd was released 2002 and was featured on Linkin Parks remix album Reanimation.

Enth E Nd got remixed by KutMasta Kurt and features a verse by Motion Man.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Motion Man]
Ayo, when this first started off it was just Linkin Park
And then in the middle, came Motion Man
And at the end of it all, it was KutMasta Kurt with a remix
(A remix, a remix, a remix, a remix)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
When I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slippin' away
And I watched it count down to the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below
When I watched the time go right out the window
Tryna grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard
(Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(I've, I've, I've)
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

Ayo, one thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know, hah, I so-socialize
Like the host of the party
I spoke, shaked, and made eye contact
Partied and toasted strong, all that
Northeast, Southwest coast
I'm staring out the window
No opportunity to mingle
I tried to sew it up, you weaken your system
And had to throw it up
I brought you back into things
Like imaginary man of your dreams
You'd always seem to make it worth it
I pig-skin, I never nerf it
You felt leather, never pleather
Real bringin' the pleasure
By any means, it means I'm leavin' your team
Hell of a team, man, it seems but I tried so hard
(Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(I've, I've, I've)
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
One thing, I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
'Cause when I designed this rhyme
I was scared of it all, scared to fall
And hadn't even tried to crawl
But I was forced to run, with you mockin' me
Stopping me, backstabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Watch the clock now, chock full of hypocrisy
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said to make things fail
Every single word you sputtered just to get your piece
But it really doesn't matter to me
'Cause from the start to the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard
(Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard)
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(I've, I've, I've)
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all

There's nothing left but to turn and face you
When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me
Asking, "Why?"

Lyrics:

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
Your lies
Rah

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah
I didn't think that I had a debt to pay
'Til they came to take all I had left away
You said you wouldn't put me to the test today
But I remember you saying that yesterday
There was a time when your mind wasn't out of control
Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul
Like a pill you couldn't swallow and it swallowed you whole
Another lie hard to follow 'til it followed you home
And like that

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Broken down, a victim of your lies

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]

If you think that you could climb out of this hole
Forsaken, what we take when
All our lies are from the power of control
Broken down, a victim of your lies

Title: SKIN TO BONE
Release Date: June 20, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Linkin-park-skin-to-bone-lyrics
Song Description: SKIN TO BONE is the ninth track off of Linkin Parks fifth studio album LIVING THINGS.

In an interview for the album, Chester Bennington talked about how certain tracks started out as folk songs and cited SKIN TO BONE as an example of the change. Brad Delson also stated something similar in an interview with MusicRadar in 2012:

SKIN TO BONE has it and CASTLE OF GLASS has it. I listened to a lot of those old folk songs for song structure, and I found that the A sections have the meat, and B is like a bridge or a departure and then you come back to the A; whereas in pop radio or hip-hop or rock for the most part these days, its like the verse is always serving the chorus  the second thing is the hook. The songs are structurally and inherently more of a folk form.

The song has never been played live on its own before and is one of the most unpopular tracks on LIVING THINGS, merely beating three other tracks on the album in Spotify streams.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Skin to bone, steel to rust
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Let tomorrow have its way with the promises we made
Skin to bone, steel to rust

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Your deception, my disgust
When your name is finally drawn
I'll be happy that you're gone
Ash to ashes, dust to dust

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Skin to bone and steel to rust

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Right to left, left to right
Night to day and day to night
As the starlight fades to grey, I'll be marchin' far away
Right to left and left to right

Lyrics:

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Yo

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Watch as the room rocks, mentally moonwalk
Mixed Media slang bangin' in your boombox
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip-hop rhymes are childish

You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rappin' to a beat doesn't make you an MC
With your lack of skill and facility, you're killin' me
And a DJ in the group just for credibility
I heard that some of you are gettin' help with your rhymes
You're not an MC if someone else writes your lines
Rappin' over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
'Cause rock and hip-hop have collaborated for years
But now, they're getting randomly mixed and matched up
All after a fast buck, and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up? None of it's real
You wanna be an MC? You've gotta study the skill

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?

So, you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
But mentally, you don't have the hip-hop energy
With a tendency to make up stories (Bullshit)
Sounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40 (Top 40)

And your record company is completely missin' it
All the kids are dissin' it for not bein' legitimate
So in a battle, you can't hack it, react with wack shit
And get smacked with verbal backflips

Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
It's taken decades for MC's to establish this
You're new to hip-hop, and welcome if you're serious
But not on the mic, leave that to the experienced

[Break: Mike Shinoda]
Using the waves of sound
The true master paralyzes his opponents
Leaving him vulnerable to attack

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!
Who can rock a rhyme like this?

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
After years of pain-staking research by the world's leading sound scientists
We here at the Sound Institute have invented a reliable audio weapons system
Actual movement of musical sound in space used to carefully attack and neutralize the cellular structure of the human body
And the question must be asked…

Who can rock a rhyme like this?

Lyrics:

[Intro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
We're stuck in a place so dark, you can hardly see
A manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me
I block out the sight of the powers that be
And duck away into the darkness, time's up
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut
So tight that it blurs into the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory, you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly

Listen to the sound, dizzy from the ups and downs
And nauseated by the polluted rot that's all around
Watching the wheels of cars that pass
I look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
A window grows, captures the eye
And cries out yellow light as it passes me by
And a young, shadowy figure sits in front of a box
Inside a building of rock with antennas on top
Now, nothing can stop in this land of the pain
The sane lose, not knowing they were part of the game
And while the insides change, the box stays the same
And the figure inside could bear anybody's name
The memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
Someday, I'm hoping to close my eyes and pretend
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again

[Pre-Chorus: Chali 2Na & Mike Shinoda]
Yo, from the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me

[Verse 3: Chali 2Na]
I'm here at this podium talking, the ceremonial offerings
Dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring (What's happening?)
City governments are eternally napping
Trapped in greedy covenants, causing urban collapse
And bullets that scar souls with dark holes
Get more than your car stole
Some hearts be blacker than charcoal (For real)
This society's deprivation depends
Not on our differences, but the separation within
No reparation is made, limited aid on minimum wage
Living in a tenement cage where rent isn't paid
Tragedy within a parade
The darkness overspreads like a permanent plague
I'm the forgotten
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up8Embed
