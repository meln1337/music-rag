Artist: Korn
Artist Description: Bakersfield friends James “Munky” Shaffer, Reginald “Fieldy” Arvizu and David Silveria formed the funk-rock band LAPD in 1989 and moved to Los Angeles with another friend Brian “Head” Welch as their roadie. Later, with Welch as second guitarist, the band named themselves Creep and recorded a demo with pal Ross Robinson.

However, when Shaffer and Welch visited family in Bakersfield, they met Jonathan Davis who added a darker, goth-tinged edge to the band’s heavy groove. Robinson recalled:

The band wasn’t dark yet; it had, like, killer grooves and good riffs, but there was some happy edge to it. And when (Davis) walked into the room, it went dark and goth. Basically, during the first song, to audition in the rehearsal room, he started freaking the hell out [laughs]. You couldn’t hear his voice, but you felt chills all over your body, and it was instantly like, “Oh my God, yeah – he’s the one.”

They chose the name Korn (based on a gross story Davis once overheard) and recorded four songs inspired by acts like Pantera, Ice Cube, Duran Duran, Cypress Hill, The Cure, Primus and potentially anything in between. That demo attracted Immortal Records. Their debut album only peaked at #72 in the US, but over time became the seed that sprouted into a whole new style of heavy music most commonly called nu-metal. Davis explained in 2015:

At the time in rock, there was nothing new or different, and it felt so stagnant. And here come these guys from Bakersfield with this bouncing sound, and I’m screaming my throat out, being super emotional and bringing up all this weird shit … It changed everything, man. And I’m not saying that because I was in the band, but I started seeing kids in baggy clothes and metal kids in Adidas.

Korn’s second album Life Is Peachy began to expand the band’s sound from just dark and serious into frivolity, with a light-hearted cover of “Low Rider” and the band’s first almost-hit in the US “ADIDAS”. The formula worked in the UK where all three singles reached the top 30.

It was the band’s third album Follow The Leader, another collection of dark songs mixed in with some silly ones, that broke the band in the US. Despite two of its singles only reaching the top 20 on two rock charts (but not crossing over to mainstream success), Korn became what Noisey called “the biggest band in the fucking world”.

With an established sound, the band continued releasing successful albums and playing to packed arenas through the 2000s. But aside from their experimental tenth album The Path Of Totality – a mixing of metal and dubstep – their albums remained formulaic and predictable. They are still best remembered for their self-titled debut and third album Follow The Leader. In 2005, it was common to refer to Korn as a band whose best albums are their odd-numbered ones:

The received wisdom about Korn is that they deliver on the odd numbers. Album one, ‘Korn’, revitalised metal, dragging it out of the middle ages into the modern era. Album three, ‘Follow The Leader’, took the form into the mainstream, blowing boundaries and preconceptions. Album four, ‘Issues’, was dense and impenetrable.

Welch quit in 2005 after having “Revelation of Christ” and Silveria left silently in 2006, but years later revealed one reason for leaving was that he “was being asked to be a puppet and dumb down my playing” while producers made “cookie cutter Korn songs”. Welch later rejoined in 2013.

The band’s lifestyles have changed drastically over the band’s three-decade career, moving away from the spoils of excess to inspiring others to overcome their addictions and depression. In 2016, Davis told The Guardian:

Nothing brings more joy into my fucking heart than seeing our music help a kid who is depressed, or suicidal, or going through an episode. That’s the payoff to me, that’s why we keep coming out here, that’s why we keep making records. Because we like to see people smile.

As of 2020, the band has released 13 albums. The first seven are certified platinum and the band is widely recognized as a pioneer of “one of heavy music’s biggest paradigm shifts”. They’re credited with creating the genre ‘nu-metal’ – a label Davis originally rejected:

I’d like to find that fucking writer that coined that term, nu-metal … Yeah, we’re heavy and downtuned, but metal, to me, is like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. That’s metal, man. I always thought of us as a funk band, that funky groovy shit.

On June 21st, 2021, Arvizu announced a hiatus from the band, citing personal issues and tension with those around him.

Title: Freak on a Leash
Release Date: May 25, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-freak-on-a-leash-lyrics
Song Description: Freak on a Leash was Jonathan Davis' complaint against the music industry that abuses him, leaving him feeling like a freak touring corporate America fucking making all the money while its taking a part of me.

The music video was directed by Todd McFarlane, with help from Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, and features animated segments reminiscent of the Follow the Leader cover drawn by McFarlane himself. It won Best Editing and Best Rock Video at the MTV Music Awards in 1999, as well as the Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video in 2000.

Something's raped and taken from me, from me

Life's gotta always be messin' with me (You wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free? (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain? (You wanna see the light)
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain

Sometimes, I cannot take this place
Sometimes, it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes, I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I weren't meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

[Verse 3]

Title: Daddy
Release Date: October 11, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-daddy-lyrics
Song Description: Daddy is the final song on Korns groundbreaking self-titled debut album. Though vocalist Jonathan Davis shouts to the rapist that they are doing this to their own child, he was not molested by a parent. It was actually a babysitter:

Its not about my parents molesting me or any of that shit. It was about me being abused by someone else and my parents not really believing me, which I believe happens to tons of kids. I believe tons of kids go back and say, Hey mom, dad, this shit happened and theyre like, Stop fucking lying. Or they dont understand. And they were real young at the time and I dont blame them. It was my babysitter, and she has since passed away. Karmas a bitch.

In 2014, band members and album producer Ross Robinson told Rolling Stone that the sobbing at the end of the song is real. Robinson kept recording Davis' breakdown and directed the band to resume playing as it continued.

For twenty years after the albums release, Korn performed the song live only once, in April 1995. On the bands 20th anniversary tour in 2015, they performed Daddy each night as part of their set list, which included every song from their debut album:

Its not going to affect me like it did back then. There was abuse there, I dealt with it, and the person who abused me is dead now. Karma took them. And, yknow, Ive buried that. Im just going to play the song for the people that need it, you know what I mean?

Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
Innocent child, looking so sweet

[Part II: Michael & Geri]

[Spoken]
Hi, Geri
Uh, is it okay if I come over and take a look at your exhaust manifold on your Dodge Dart?
I've got a piece missing somewhere on mine, and I'm not sure what it is
I wanna see what you got on yours, ha-ha
Throttle lever strikes dash-pot rod, the rod must push diaphragm back
Before it can move back, air must be pushed up in
This causes the diaphragm to move slowly when the throttle valve is moved away
Stream will force diaphragm out, the air must now vent, dash-pot is ready to work again
(Mhm, see this?)
I don't care what that-
(The rod, that they're talking about-)
I don't care what that looks like Geri, I'm telling you what the dash-pot is
Where's the dash-pot on here, Geri?
(I don't know)
Dash-pot is inside. Geri, where it's hooked up at
And that is not made-, that is not made to regulate the fuckin' choke goin' back and forth
(And that's not the end-loader?)
That's so you can get pure fuel in there
As soon as you start cranking it over, whoa
It will start sucking, and when I start sucking, this choke here-
'Cause you can't just have pure fuel, it won't light, you have to have a little bit of oxygen
It sucks open and it cracks the choke like this
And that's how that works
(That is not what you just said)
I said no, Geri, the heating is the motherfucking spring
This one here, as soon as you start turnin' over the engine
It's supposed to pull it back when the vacuum starts
When the vacuum starts, nothin' to do with fuckin' heat, vacuum
(Why are you screaming?)
Because you said-, you said "It's supposed to work off heat" no, Geri
(You said, "As the car gradually warms up...")
As it gradually warms up, this motherfucker with the coil, the spring, opens it up
This has already done its job, the only thing its job is to do is when you're cranking the engine up
After it's been choked, all it does is pull back, and it cracks it open just a pinch
(Then you don't know what it's called)
The Choke Vacuum Diaphragm (okay)
I mean, it's right there in the book
(Sure it is)
Oh, God, you're a hard, hard woman to live with
(If it was right here in the book, I would have found it)
Oh, you motherfucker, you asshole, you stupid son of a bitch, you showed it to me
(What?)
You showed me the goddamn thing in the book what it was called, that's what I knew what it was
(Get out of here and quit yelling at me)
No, Geri, you're fucked
(I haven't seen that in there)
"I haven't seen it," you stupid son of a bitch
(That vacuum thing? Yes)
(We don't know what the little business is.)
(It doesn't explain anything, I haven't read anything that explains that)
I told you what it says (yeah, you did, yes, yesterday)
I just told you what it did
And you're sittin' there saying you never saw that before
And yet you're the one that fuckin' showed me it, Geri
(You stink like gas)
(I told you that fuckin' fuel filter was not on there)
(It's not that fuckin' orange business hanging across the goddamn business)
Let's try rebuilding the fucking carburetor first, Geri
Let me tell you something, Geri
Let me tell you a little secret, Geri
(Don't tell me any secrets, be quiet)
Oh, man, I quit, I am fed up, I mean
I tell you something and you fuckin' don't believe me
You show me something and you still don't fuckin' believe me
(I can't show you anything Michael, because your head is blank)
Well, you're sitting there telling me that motherfucker isn't that
Well, that's not how it works
Well, Geri, a mechanic told me that's how it works
(Who's talking about the truck? We're talking about-)
A Dodge Dart, on slant 6
(You have lost your mind)
What are you talkin' about?
(My God)

A place I like to hide

A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind, blind

To escape the pain inside

Another kind of pain

Title: All in the Family
Release Date: July 18, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-all-in-the-family-lyrics
Song Description: The song From Korns 3rd album is a rhyme duel between Korn frontman Jon Davis and Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst. Jon and Fred go at each-others throats with all kinds of brutal, funny and disgusting insults.

Shortly after the release of Follow The Leader, Limp Bizkit joined Korn on the first season of their long running Family Values Tour, the name of which may have been inspired by this song.

Though this track is sometimes listed as the lead single from the album, it was only released as a demo/teaser version before the first proper single Got the Life was released.
Lyrics:

Title: Falling Away from Me
Release Date: November 16, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-falling-away-from-me-lyrics
Song Description: Falling Away from Me is the second track, and lead single, off of Korns fourth album, Issues.

The song deals with domestic abuse and the effects it has on the mental state of its victims, such as suicidal ideation and anxiety over the situation.

The song initially premiered on the South Park episode Korns Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery on October 27th, 1999 and was released to radio the next day. As the song grew in popularity, it was being uploaded to file-sharing clients under the false name Beating Me Down.



During their performance at Woodstock 99 music festival in July 1999, Korn performed the seemingly unfinished song at the time with different lyrics.

The single was a commercial success, peaking on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 at #8 on Christmas Day 1999 as well as #7 on the Mainstream Rock Charts on January 9th, 2000 and charting in 6 countries overall.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Hey, I'm feeling tired
My time has gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's okay
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me
[Verse 2]
Day is here fading
That's when I'm insane
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kill the pain
I can't always say
"It's gonna be better tomorrow"

Release Date: October 15, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-twist-lyrics
Song Description: The opening track of Korns sophomore effort Life Is Peachy is a short album intro involving nonsensical scatting alternated with the word twist.

When Rock N Roll Experience asked Jonathan Davis what he was saying in the song, he responded:

 Not a damn word..its my crazy scatting style I guess.

A reference to this song is made at the beginning of the song Clown on the bands debut (right before Jonathan Davis is heard asking, Wanna hear it?)

Why'd you tease me, made me feel upset?

Hey you, faget, get away, we don't want none
I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way every day
Who gives a fuck? Right now I got something to say
To all the people that think that I'm strange
And I should be out here locked up in a cage
You don't know what the hell is up now anyway
You got this pretty boy feeling like I'm enslaved
To a world that never appreciated shit
You can suck my dick and fucking like it

Title: Got the Life
Release Date: November 23, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-got-the-life-lyrics
Song Description: Got The Life was released as a promotional single for their third studio album. Though never actually making much of a radio buzz until after the bands success, the music video was the first video ever to be retired on MTVs TRL, which was a much bigger deal in the 90s.

The track was originally based off of a disco beat and serves almost like a fuck you to other metal bands trying to copy their pioneered sound.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Hate, something, sometime, someway
Something kicked off the front for me
Something inside (I'll never ever follow)
So give me something that is for real (I'll never ever follow)

[Interlude]
Get your boogie on
Get your boogie on

[Verse 2]
Hate, something, someway, each day
Feeling ripped off and given away
This shit inside (Now everyone will follow)
So give me nothing, just feel (And now this shit will follow)

[Chorus]
God paged me, "You'll never see the light", who wants to see?
God told me, "I've already got the life", oh I say
God paged me, "You'll never see the light", who wants to see?
God told me, "I've already got the life", oh I say

[Bridge]
Each day I can feel it swallow
Inside something took from me
I don't feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow
Inside I was beating me
You will never see, so come dance with me
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
Dance with me (Rum-biddie-boo, rum-bum-dee-dum)
Dance with me (Rum-biddie-boo, rum-bum-dee-dum-dee-bum-did)
Dance with me (Rum-biddie-boo, rum-bum-dee-doo)

Title: Twisted Transistor
Release Date: September 27, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-twisted-transistor-lyrics
Song Description: Twisted Transistor is the first and lead single of Korns seventh album See You on the Other Side, it has become Korns second most successful single to date on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching number 64.

 In the music video four rappers play the parts of Korn: Lil Jon as Jonathan Davis, Xzibit as Fieldy, David Banner as David Silveria, and Snoop Dogg as Munky. The real Korn appears at the end of the video as representatives of Fony Music, complaining about how the music video isnt going to sell because it lacks bling-bling and booty shakin'.

 The song itself is about feeling lonely and like nothing in your life is well and music is the only thing that can keep you alive. Jonathan Davis said this about the song:

You know that feeling when youre alone in your room, you feel bad and nothing around you seems to be going well then suddenly when you turn on your radio, you are immediately deep in the music. Thats exactly the subject of Twisted Transistor with the lyrics: A lonely life where no one understands you but dont give up because the music do
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Hey you, hey you, Devil's little sister
Listening to your twisted transistor
Hold it between your legs
Turn it up, turn it up
Low end is coming through
Can't get enough

[Pre-Chorus]
A lonely life where no one understands you
But don't give up because the music do
Music do, music do

Title: Clown
Release Date: October 11, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-clown-lyrics
Song Description: Clown was one of two songs released in advance to promote Korns forthcoming debut self-titled album.



It was later released to radio in 1996 as the albums fourth single.

Its lyrics were inspired by a concertgoer in San Diego who verbally harrassed the band, telling them to go back to their hometown of Bakersfield. The man later took a swing at frontman Jonathan Davis when Davis knelt down to hear him. The punch missed and the bands manager took care of the concertgoer.

The name came from the man being covered in tattoos, with Jonathan Davis thinking he looked like a clown with all the tattoos.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Jonathan Davis, Head, David Silveria, and Ross Robinson]
"Anger builds within my body", alright, go
(Ah) "Four" I just said, (Four?) you faggot piece of shit (Four?) on the ground
Four?
Ugh, hey, what are you talkin' about, Ross?
Hey, the song starts
Hey, are you saying so there's no clicks?
(Hey, we're recording, now start)
Just fucking do it, dammit
Look at "Twist", I wish we could put "Twist" on the fuckin' tape
Wanna hear it? (Stupid)
Fuck you, fuck you
(Go)
Okay, you piece of shit

[Verse 1]
Anger inside builds within my body
Why'd you hit me?
What have I done?
You tried to hit me

[Chorus]
Scream at me again if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me 'cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me

Title: Narcissistic Cannibal

Song Description: This song has 8 million views on YouTube and is on the Korn album The Path of Totality (2011), in which Korn created a genre called Dustep Metal. The song is bascially about watching people who are so fascinated with themselves, they destroy themselves. They basically eat themselves alive because of their obession with themselves. Thats the gist of the story.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Don't wanna be sly and defile you
Desecrate my mind and rely on you
I just wanna break this crown
But it's hard when I'm so run down
And you're so cynical
Narcissistic cannibal
Got to bring myself back from the dead

[Chorus]
Sometimes I hate the life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on, I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Is haunting me, taking its sweet time

[Bridge]
Holding on, I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life to the end of my days

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna be rude but I have to
Nothing's good about the hell you put me through

Release Date: October 11, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-shoots-and-ladders-lyrics
Song Description: Shoots & Ladders is Korns third single. Its lyrics are mainly the recitation of several classic nursery rhymes with a chorus expressing concern about the dark origin and nature of them. Its title is a variation on the childrens board game Chutes And Ladders.

The physical promotional CD single sent to radio also includes the first release of Sean Olson, a bonus track not included on the bands self-titled debut album.

Shoots & Ladders was nominated for a Grammy for Best Metal Performance in 1996, their first of several nominations.

According to Rolling Stone, the band stopped performing this song in concert in 1997 until their 20th anniversary tour, where they played every song from their debut album each night, but fans have reported hearing it performed during that time as part of a medley.

Its notable that Shoots and Ladders is the first song in the bands discography featuring bagpipes, which are played by frontman Jonathan Davis.

Title: Trash
Release Date: November 16, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-trash-lyrics
Song Description: this song is obviously about a guy whos in a relationship he doesnt want to be in because he feels hes not worthy. He goes around and fucks every girl he can but is pained by the fact that his true girlfriend stays with him even though she knows.
The guy in the song has a void in his soul that he tries to fill by fucking, but the more he does it the emptier he feels.
I tell my lies and I despise every second Im with you hes lying to his girlfriend about the other girls and it kills him inside.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
How did it start?
Well, I don't know, I just feel the craving
I see the flesh, and it smells fresh
And it's just there for the taking
These little girls
They make me feel so goddamn exhilarated
I fill them up, I can't give it up
The pain that I'm just erasing

[Bridge]
I tell my lies, and I despise
Every second I'm with you
So I run away, and you still stay
So what the fuck is with you?

[Chorus]
Your feelings, I can't help but rape them!
I'm sorry, I don't feel the same!
My heart inside is constantly hating!
I'm sorry, I just throw you away!

[Verse 2]
I don't know why I'm so fucking cold
I don't know why it hurts me
All I wanna do is get with you
And make the pain go away
Why do I have a conscience?
All it does is fuck with me
Why do I have this torment?
All I wanna do is fuck it away

Title: Ball Tongue
Release Date: October 11, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-ball-tongue-lyrics
Song Description: Originally recorded as Amongst The Greed under the bands earlier name Creep (with vocalist Corey Cinque), Ball Tongue was slowed down and given new lyrics when Jonathan Davis replaced Cinque.

In guitarist Brian Head Welchs book Save Me From Myself he explained that Ball Tongue was the nickname of the owner of a practice space called the Underground Chicken Sound where Korn practiced who became their tour manager (but was later fired). When they were doing drugs together, sometimes theyd get so tweaked out that Ball Tongue couldnt talk no matter how he tried. He would just sit there with his mouth open, tongue sticking out, and the tongue looked like it had a little ball on the end. (page 51)

Bassist Fieldy told Rolling Stone:

I remember recording Ball Tongue and it kinda felt like we finally hit that song that everything Korn stood for was in this song.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Jonathan Davis]
There you are alone
With no hope of ever having something to be proud of
Something earned without begging
Yes, I know you're a person, a person close to me
Who do you think you are?
And what more do you want from me?

[Chorus: Jonathan Davis & Head]
Ball tongue [Scatting]

[Verse 2: Jonathan Davis]
Why are you at home, buried in your self-pity?
Why do you insist on living the life clean out of me?
Yes, I know you're the person, the person that took time with me
Does it give you the right to expect your life revolves around me?

How can you fucking doubt me?
But not again (Yes, I know you're a person)

How can you fucking doubt me?

Yo Chuck, we got running mixes in the headphones

One, two, three, and I come with the wicked style (style)
You know that I'm from the wicked crew
You act like you knew
But I got everybody jumping to the voodoo
Yeah, you, you can kick it wicked rhymes, picket signs
While me and the mob gotta trunk full of nines
Drop, and I'll slay ya
Play, play thug-made, ah from the heya
Ready to buck, buck, buck
But it's a must to duck, duck, duck
Before I bust ya
Looking for the one that did it
You want my vote, no you're never gonna get it
'Cause I'm the one with the fat, mad skills
And I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills
Sittin' at the pad just chillin'
Larry Parker just got two million
Oh, what a fuckin' feelin'
That nigga done past me the peel
And I'll slam dunk ya like Shaquille O'Neal
Like it, work it, baby I'll rock that test tube baby
Kick it, 'cause I get…

You come my way, ya get served
Still got a deuce  that'll bunny hop the curb
Nappy head, nappy chest
Nappy chin, never seen with a happy grin
Gotta fat frown 'cause I'm down
So take a look around
All you see is big black boots
Step in, use my steel toe as a weapon
And it's awfully quiet, they want to label this nigga
Do with the sticker, but that's nasty
'Cause I gotta body count like Ice-T
From here to New York
I get them skins, and I ain't talking about pork
You're sly, ya pig, dig, listen from the flow from a so-fro'd caucasian
Ah, who didn't know I was as funky as Wilson Picket, but you talkin'

I got a gat, and I'm sitting at the window like Malcolm
Ready to bring that noise
Kinda trigger-happy like the Geto Boys
April twenty-ninth was power to the people
Y'all might just see a sequel
'Cause police got equal pay
A horse is a pig that don't fly straight!
I'm doin' Darryl Gates, but is Willie Williams
Down with the pilgrims?
I'm through with the picket signs
So I think the job is dead, get out 'cause I get...

Song Description: Jonathan Davis wrote this song about when he worked as an autopsy assistant at a coroners office and saw a baby who was murdered and raped by her father.

Its a story about this little girl that came into the coroners office when I was working there and she was fked by her dad. She was an 11 month old little baby girl. Her legs were broken back behind her and he just fked her like a toy doll and chucked her in the bathroom. It was the most heinous thing Ive ever seen in my life and I still have nightmares about it.
-John Davis
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
So, so young
Raped, but I don't realize
Small, white legs, broke
The pain between her thighs

[Chorus]
I see your pretty face
Smashed against the bathroom floor
What a disgrace
Who do I feel sorry for?

Skin so cold
How could someone steal a life?
Takes the blame
Wait, I got some shit to say

I see your pretty face
Smashed against the bathroom floor

Title: Insane
Release Date: August 21, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-insane-lyrics
Song Description: Insane follows on the heels of the current Korn hit Rotting in Vain.

This track is straight-up Korn heavy, with some brutal Jonathan Davis belting and a bouncing beat bolstered by by a crushing wall of guitars and bass. The song feels like a perfect fit within the bands catalog, reminiscent of some of their earlier works, especially the main riff.
Lyrics:

Things keep ending up this way
Another notch is carved away
In the thoughts of mass decay
Funny how things end up this way

Growing deep within my head
Softly dying, its soul is shed
Eating me all up inside
This cancer finds everything I hide
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

[Post-Chorus]

Release Date: June 26, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-youll-never-find-me-lyrics
Song Description: Youll Never Find Me is the lead single off of Korns 13th album, The Nothing. The track was released on June 26, 2019 with an accompanying visualizer on YouTube. A music video was later uploaded on July 18, 2019.

Before the track had its final title, it was originally referred to as Smog Check, the reason being that guitarist Welch took off early during the recording session to have his vehicle checked out.

Youll Never Find Me also marks the first collaboration between Korn and Smashing Pumpkins mastermind, Billy Corgan. Davis told Revolver that Corgan mostly assisted with the vocal melodies for the song. Continuing to recall his experience the the Pumpkin frontman, he commented:

We sat in two chairs like this and he picked up an acoustic guitar and he started playing the chord progressions while I was singing the melodiesIve never done anything like that before, and it was a really cool experience."
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Life is degrading and silently making me
Spun out inside my own head
Spewing and craving, this darkness is baiting me
Down the road to my own death

Watch it all fall down

So come give me the truth you hide
Take the pain inside

It feeds on the doubt in my heart
Sinking and fading, our feelings I'm saving
To fix what I tore all apart

Title: A Different World
Release Date: September 29, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-a-different-world-lyrics
Song Description: The song is about being in horrible situations and facing pain, wanting to escape to a different place, a different world. A place where that shit cant find you, thats the gist of the song. Corey came in and did some backgrounds on my choruses. Its really cool how the song works  it starts, and you hear Corey creeping in more and more until the bridge where he sings, and then its just full-on after that.  Jonathan Davis
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Jonathan Davis]
I dream of a past so I can break through
The walls I have built inside
The thoughts I can't grasp, transparent, see-through
They constantly fight and collide

[Pre-Chorus: Jonathan Davis]
I'd love to see a different world
A place where you can't find me

[Chorus: Jonathan Davis, Corey Taylor, Jonathan Davis & Corey Taylor]
Feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore
Kill me, kill me, that's what you've got to face my friend (My friend)
This ain't the end (The end)

[Verse 2: Jonathan Davis]
Why can't I relax and let it be true?
This world that I tried to hide
It's kind of a mess, too reckless for you
This place makes me feel alive

This ain't the end (The end)

[Bridge: Corey Taylor]
The call for the purposes, the changing behavior
Ends at us all, we keep constraints on the strangers
It gets on top of you and forces your perspective
Then you know it, you feel it
It's as dark as you can get, you want it
Harder, harder, harder, give it to you
Harder, harder, you might just want it
Harder, harder, harder, give it to you
Harder, harder, I don't think you'll ever get it

Title: Good God
Release Date: November 7, 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-good-god-lyrics
Song Description: Good God is the third single off Life Is Peachy, and deals with one-sided relationships, with Davis focusing on a friend from his adolescence who sabotaged Davis' love life and forced Davis into certain lifestyles in order to project his own insecurities. Davis regrets becoming friends with him and wishes he had gotten rid of him sooner, realizing that he is much better off not having him in his life.

An alleged direct quote of Davis' (referenced often online about the songs meaning) goes as following: Its about a guy I knew in school who I thought was my friend, but who fucked me. He came into my life with nothing, hung out at my house, lived off me, and made me do shit I didnt really wanna do. I was into new romantic music and he was a mod, and hed tell me if I didnt dress like a mod he wouldnt be my friend anymore. Whenever I had plans to go on a date with a chick hed sabotage it, because he didnt have a date or nothing. He was a gutless fucking nothing. I havent talked to him for years.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You came into my life without a single thing
I gave into your ways, which left me with nothing
I've given into smiles, I fell for all your games
I wish so bad right now I hadn't let you in

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now?
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now?

[Chorus]
The sea of life, you're just a minnow
Live your life insecure
Feel the pain of your needles
As they shit into my brain

[Verse 2]
I scream without a sound, how could you take away
Everything that I was? Made me a fucking slave
Your face that I despise, your heart inside that's gray
I came today to say you're fucked in every way

Release Date: October 7, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-right-now-lyrics
Song Description: Jonathan Davis went in with more context on the song meaning, saying:

Its about basically me waking up pissed off at the world, hating everyone and everything around me. I think everyones had one of those days when you wake up and you dont want to talk to no one and youre just pissed. I had one of those days and I wrote about it. I was venting out all of my frustrations towards everyone.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling mean today
Not lost, not blown away
Just irritated and quite hated
Self-control breaks down
Why's everything so tame?
I like my life insane
I'm fabricating and debating
Who I'm gonna kick around

[Chorus]
Right now! (Can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you)
Right now! (I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you)
Right now! (I rip apart the things inside that excite you)
Right now! (I can't control myself, I fucking hate you)

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling cold today
Not hurt, just fucked away
I'm devastated and frustrated
God, I feel so bound
So why do I feel the need?
I think it's time to bleed
I'm gonna cut myself
And watch the blood hit the ground

There you are, my precious

Of your broken soul
Why is it always, you want something you can never have?
Why'd you try to tempt me?
How could you be this way?

Then your eyes roll back (Can you feel the pain?)
Love racing through my veins (Can you feel the pain?)

Black orgasms (Can't you feel the pain?)
I kiss your lifeless skin (Can't you feel the pain?)

[Verse 2]
There you are, my precious
With your broken soul
Rubbing my crotch, elated
Taking control
Why is it always, you fuck up something you have always had?
Why'd you try to tempt me?
How could you be so cold?

Your throat, I take grasp (Can't you feel the pain?)
Then your eyes roll back (Can't you feel the pain?)
Love racing through my veins (Can't you feel the pain?)

Feeling pain, gives me life
Relieving us is my plan

Or do l stand my ground
And accept my fate?

And there's the faceless cries
That twist my every dream
And almost every night
I hear the demon sing

[Chorus]
Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?

You're leading me to places I can never follow

Title: Alone I Break
Release Date: June 11, 2002, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-alone-i-break-lyrics
Song Description: Alone I Break is the third single off of the bands 2002 album Untouchables.

Although it wasnt as successful when compared to their first two singles (Here to Stay and Thoughtless) off the album, this could be their most powerful track in regards to the lyrical content and the emotion conveyed by Jonathan Davis in his singing. In the studio, Munky and Head used custom 14-string guitars to create a wide chorus sound, and synthetic drum beats were used.

The whole band was going through some rough times around Untouchables and Davis wrote this song because of it. Davis, in particular, was extremely depressed around this time. With everybody in the band feeling emotional as they were, Davis felt this song was an accurate depiction to how he and the other members felt at the time.

The central theme of this song is depression consuming you to the point where suicide seems like the appropriate response.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Pick me up
Been bleeding too long
Right here, right now
I'll stop it somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I will make it go away
Can't be here no more
Seems this is the only way
I will soon be gone

Leaving doesn't seem so strange
I am hoping I can find
Where to leave my hurt behind
All the shit I seem to take
All alone I seem to break

Is it only black in space?

What is it that I've become?
Is there something more to come?

Living life, don't you cry

Startle me, someone save me

They bury me

But you slap me
And you make some fucked up comment about my clothes
Then I tried to let it pass
But the visions in my head
Were with you
With a knife up your ass, laying dead
So I pop some more caps in your ass
Now your son is not so fun

Never try to play me
You made my life not so good

Title: B.B.K.
Release Date: August 18, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-bbk-lyrics
Song Description: B.B.K. is the fourth single of Follow the Leader. The acronym stands for Bye Bye Kids or Big Black Kock. It contains harsh guitar sounds somewhat reminiscent of industrial metal, and features scat vocals in the spots of the song where most traditional metal bands would have opted to implement a guitar solo.

Big black cock! Thats what I call a Jack and Coke. Those little glasses they serve in Europe and everything. Thats what I named it, big black cock. And thats another song about me dealing with the pressures of this album and how I, you know, Im trying to kill myself, but you know? Do I really want to kill myself? Things Im just questioning myself. Most of this is self-structured.  Jonathan Davis
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
So you see I've gotten this far
Please give me some place to rage
I'm not trying to go there
So take me away

[Verse 2]
Life sometimes pisses me off
It's never a good trip for me
Every time I reach for love
It's taken away

[Chorus]
Night, so I play
Give me a sign, this is day
Give me some patience, so I pray
It's time to die, is that what I want?

[Verse 3]
There's nothing wrong wanting to be loved
Is there something wrong with me?
For once in my life, I'd like to be really set free
Let me be me

[Chorus]
Night, so I play
Give me a sign, this is day
Give me some guidance, so I pray

Burying my life so slowly

Feeling like I'm God
With the world around me

Reaming through my heart
Screaming through my voice
Nothing I can kill
Screaming a lie I am
Can't you tear my eyes out?
Can't you take my heart away to heart?
Goodbye

Title: Divine
Release Date: October 11, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-divine-lyrics
Song Description: Divine, the fifth track of Korns debut self-titled album, was one of the earliest songs the band recorded at the legendary Buck Owens studio in Bakersfield. Suicidal Tendencies (and later Metallica) bassist Robert Trujillo was involved in writing the song.

Some fans suggest Divine is about the sting of revenge, telling a story of Jonathan wanting someone who didnt want him but then the tables turn and he finds this person wants him now. Others believe the song is about a guy doing whatever it takes to get rid of a girl. There is also speculation that the song title refers to the 300-pound transvestite actor Divine, since frontman Jonathan Davis was a fan of his work.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I hide only to defy you
Take away the only love inside you
I'll see your face through everyone
Inside I've just begun
You think I'm out to scare you?
I'm only out to prepare you
For when you stop and turn around
Your body's going down

[Chorus]
You're gonna waste your time
Your life will soon be mine
You're definitely one of a kind
Your suffering 'cause of me is divine

[Verse 2]
Tell me why you never liked me
Tell me once that you'll fight me
Bold, and I'll wait for the perfect time
To take what's rightfully mine
You play the dumb to defy me
You say that you don't but defy me
You wait, you don't want anyone

Now all you sucker DJs who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason, and we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and act real cool
But you got to realize that you're acting like fools

Title: Michael and Geri
Release Date: October 11, 1994, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-michael-and-geri-annotated
Song Description: Michael & Geri is the hidden track from Korns self-title 1994 debut album. The song features no instruments or vocals but a recording of a couple speaking about a broken part on a Dodge Dart.

This was not intentionally made for the album, as many people would probably guess. Producer Ross Robinson found this audio on a tape in an abandoned garage. He does not know who Michael or Geri is, or why there was a tape with the dialouge.
Lyrics:

Michael: Hi, there.
Uh, Is it okay if I come over & take a look at your, uh, exhaust manifold on your Dodge Dart?
I've got a piece missing somewhere on mine, and I'm not sure what it is.
I want to see what you got on yours.
Throttle valve strikes dash-pot rod.
The rod must push diaphragm back before it can move back, air must be pushed up in.
This causes the diaphragm to move slowly when the throttle valve is moved away.
The stream will force diaphragm out the air must now vent the dash-pot is ready to work again.

Geri: Is this, to this?

Michael: I don't care what that…

Geri: The rod that they're talking about?

Michael: I don't care what that looks like Geri, I'm telling you what the dash-pot is. Where's the dash-pot on here, Geri?

Geri: I don't know.

Michael: Dash-pot is inside Geri where it's hooked up at.

Michael: And that's not made…

Michael: And that is not made to regulate the fuckin' choke goin' back & forth.

Geri: And that's not the end-loader?
See Korn LiveGet tickets as low as $130Michael: That's just so you can get pure fuel in there.

Geri: Mm-hmm.

Michael: As soon as you start crankin' it over, whoa!
Deep now deep. You start sucking, and when I start sucking, this choke here. 'Cause you can't just have pure fuel, you won't light, you have to have a little bit of oxygen.

Geri: Mm-hmm.

Michael: It sucks open and it cracks the choke like this.
And that's how that works.

Geri: That is not what you just said.

Michael: I said, no, Geri, the heating is the motherfuckin'… spring!
This one here, as soon as you start turnin' over the engine, it's supposed to pull it back when the vacuum starts.
When the vacuum starts, nothin' to do with fuckin' heat. Vacuum!

Geri: Why are you screaming?

Michael: Because the way you said, "It's supposed to work off heat." No, Geri!

Geri: You said as the car gradually warms up.…

Michael: As it gradually warms up, this muthafucker with the coil, the spring opens it up.
This has already done it's job, the only thing it's job is to do is when you're cranking the engine up after it's been choked, all it does is pull back, then it cracks open just a pinch.
Geri: Then you don't know what it's called.

Michael: The Choke Vacuum Diaphragm.

Geri: Okay.

Michael: I mean, it's right there in the book.

Geri: Sure it is.

Michael: Oh God. You're a hard, hard woman to live with.

Geri: If it was right here in the book, I would've found it.

Michael: Oh you muthafucker, you asshole, you stupid son of a bitch, you showed it to me!

Geri: What, Mike?

Michael: You showed me the god damn thing in the book what it was called. That's what I knew what it was!

Geri: Get out of here and quit yelling at me!

Michael: No, Geri, you're fucked!

Geri: I haven't seen that in there.
Michael: I haven't seen it, you stupid son of a bitch.

Geri: That vacuum thing? Yes.
We don't know what the little business is.
It doesn't explain anything.
I haven't read anything that explains that.

Michael: I told you what it says.

Geri: Yeah, you did yes, yesterday.

Michael: I just told you what it did.

Geri: Mm-hmm?

Michael: And you're sittin' there saying you never saw that before, and yet you're the one that fuckin' showed me it, Geri.

Geri: You stink like gas.
I told you that fuckin' fuel filter was not on there.
It's not that fuckin' orange business hanging across the god damn business.

Michael: Let's try rebuilding the fuckin' carburetor first, Geri.
Let me tell you something, Geri.
Let me tell you a little secret, Geri.

Geri: Don't tell me any secrets, be quiet!

Michael: Oh, man, I quit! I am fed up! I mean, I tell you something and you fuckin' don't believe me.
You show me somethin', and you still don't fuckin' believe me.

Geri: I can't show you anything, Michael, because your head is blank.

Michael: Well your sittin' there tellin' me that muthafucker isn't that.
"Well that's not how it works."
Well, Geri, a mechanic told me that's how it works.

Geri: Who's talking about the truck? We're talkin' about…

Michael: A Dodge Dart, on slant six.

Geri: You have lost your mind.

Michael: What are you talkin' about?

Geri: My God!1Embed

Title: Idiosyncrasy
Release Date: September 13, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-idiosyncrasy-lyrics
Song Description: Idiosyncrasy is about losing someone, and feeling abandoned by it. It conveys a constant theme of The Nothing: struggling to not succumb to darkness. An idiosyncrasy is a characteristic that is unusual or unexpected of someone. It seems the narrator would never have expected this person to do what they did.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
And the dark seems to light my way
And the path is deceiving
And the end is so far away
It might just defeat me
But I gotta take my time
And I won't let it take me away
And it never got the best of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't do it
Don't give in
Won't you ever get it?
Won't you ever get it?

[Chorus]
You've chose to walk a thin line
Replaced the hurt without healing mine
You hold disgust in your heart
You just fucked with me, idiosyncrasy

[Verse 2]
In my heart lies a blackened rage
Sometimes it overtakes me
Why the fuck did I run away?
My shadow is waiting
But I gotta face the facts
Of a twisted reality
And it never got a hold of me

You hold disgust in your heart
You just fucked with me, idiosyncrasy
You've chose to walk a thin line
Replaced the hurt without healing mine
You hold disgust in your heart
You just fucked with me, idiosyncrasy

[Bridge]
Crawling down the path, I'm helpless, reaching for the light I see
Every time I get too close, the light proceeds ahead of me
Taking deep, I take a step, standing up, I take a breath
Running towards the light, I feel the fingers wrapped around my neck
God is making fun of me
He's laughing up there, I can see
God is making fun of me
He's laughing up there, I can see
God is making fun of me
God is making fun of me

Title: Mr. Rogers
Release Date: October 15, 1996, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-mr-rogers-lyrics
Song Description: Mr. Rogers is the seventh track off of Korns second album, Life is Peachy.

The song deals with the loss of innocence with Jonathan Davis focusing it on the popular American childrens television program Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, which ran on PBS from 1968 to 2001.

Jonathan feels that the host, Fred Rogers, made him more naive and feels he was lied to about the state of the world while watching childrens programming, with Jonathan regretting watching due to the teaching that everyone is friendly when he was being abused during that time in his life.

Mr. Rogers was written under the influence of amphetamines.

Are you ready for the fear to leave
So that you can breathe and not live with the danger?

But there's always something pushing me to give in
Do you really wanna make believe
And try to achieve a little break from the anger?

[Chorus]
I should've been good, I should've been down
I couldn't let go, what could I do?
(I can take it all away, the feelings)
(Break apart the pain and start the healing)
I should've withstood, I shouldn't bow down
I couldn't get through, what could I do?
(I can take it all away, the feelings)

I should've been good, I should've been down
I couldn't let go, what could I do?
(I can take it all away, the feelings)
(Break apart the pain and start the healing)
I should've withstood, I shouldn't bow down
I couldn't get through, what could I do?
(I can take it all away, the feelings)
(Break apart the pain and start the healing)

Title: Did My Time
Release Date: July 22, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-did-my-time-lyrics
Song Description: The song was an unfinished demo from 2002s Untouchables. James Munky Shaffer had written the main riff and was playing it every day, and producer Michael Beinhorn couldnt stand it. In early 2003, Korn completed the whole song, and caught the attention of Paramount Pictures who wanted to use it in the film Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life. However, the song was only released as a single for the film, and featured during the films end credits. It did not appear on the motion picture soundtrack, due to certain clauses in Jonathan Daviss record contract at the time.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Realized I can never win
Sometimes feel like I have failed
Inside where do I begin?
My mind is laughing at me
Tell me, why am I to blame?
Aren't we supposed to be the same?
That's why I will never tame
This thing that's burning in me

[Chorus]
I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I can never tell
If I've got something after me
That's why I just beg and plead
For this curse to leave me
Tell me, why am I to blame?
Aren't we suppose to be the same?
That's why I will never tame
This thing that's burning in me

Title: Dirty
Release Date: November 16, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-dirty-lyrics
Song Description: Dirty is the sixteenth and final track on Korns 1999 album Issues.

Speaking in interview about the track, lead singer Jonathan Davis has stated that he has felt almost like a prostitute in the music industry. All of his music comes from a very personal place and the music industry uses his struggles to make more money, making him feel like a dirty little whore.

This track is similar in context to Korns hit song Freak On A Leash, where Jonathan exposes corruption in the music industry and sings about how alienating it can be.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Keep knocking
No one's there
Pouring down
Near be felt

[Chorus]
I'm out here, by myself, all alone
Ready to blow my head off
I hurt so bad inside
I wish you could see the world through my eyes
Each day is the same
I just wanna laugh again

[Verse 2]
Keep hoping
Nothing to spare
So my life
Isn't quite there
I feel like a whore
A dirty whore
Such a whore
Dirty

[Chorus]
I'm out here, by myself, all alone

Title: The Darkness is Revealing
Release Date: September 13, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-the-darkness-is-revealing-lyrics
Song Description: The Darkness is Revealing is the fourth track on Korns 2019 album The Nothing. In the song, Jonathan expresses confusion regarding his emotional state, not knowing whether its a new beginning (as stated in the chorus) or something genuinely trying to kill him.

The title could mean that when you are in a state of emotional/mental crisis, theres a lot within that darkness that you learn that can drive you further within that same darkness. This could be why Jonathan asks the question, how does one start healing?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Here behind the curtain lies a darkness feeding
Pooled inside, in hunger cries, and still it's eating
Everything I had to hide is all on my sleeve
And behind the curtain lies my soul, I’m bleeding

[Pre-Chorus]
And I see it
Can't believe it
And the sun goes down
Taking my heart

[Chorus]
What is this I'm feeling?
Is it a new beginning?
Am I purging past regrets
Facing the hurt I’m dealing?
How does one start healing?
The darkness is revealing
The bittersweet reality
That this is the help I'm needing

[Verse 2]
Why must I be bastardized? My essence flees
Search my mind and all I find is banded feelings
Once you pull the bandage off, you feel the sting
Only way to fix it is through painful suffering

Title: Hater

Song Description: Regarding the song, lead vocalist Jonathan Davis says; Everyone has someone who hates on you cause you have something they want. Its really, like, the first empowering song Ive ever written. The lyrics are: 'You cant bring me down/Ive already had my life turned upside down/I ride a downward spiral round and round/But I keep flying, I keep fighting/You wont ever bring me down. Thats like the most positive shit Ive ever written. And everyone whos heard it loves it, and I think its going to give people who get down on people picking on them and hating them, like, Fuck this! I dont give a fuck what you think. I dont give a fuck what you say. You just fuckin are a hater. I think people will relate with that.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
You can't bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting, you won't ever bring me down!

[Verse 1]
I'm good, I'm fine, this life's divine
No hate, no shame, no one to blame
You might disguise, your life with lies
I won't chastise even if you think you can...

[Chorus]
Bring me down!
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting, You won’t ever bring me down!

[Verse 2]
I can't escape from your disdain
Your hurt, your pain, your drama is lame
Why can't you find some peace inside?
I won't chastise even when you think you can...

[Chorus]
Bring me down!
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying, I keep fighting, You won’t ever bring me down!

Title: Love & Meth
Release Date: October 8, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-love-and-meth-lyrics
Song Description: This songs title is a reference to Brian Head Welchs Christian Metal band, Love And Death, as well as the Methamphetamine addiction that lead to him leaving the band and finding Jesus. The song deals with conflicting emotions Head may feel regarding Korns past as one of the many Satanic Metal bands of the late 90s, as well as the demonstrated interest many Korn fans have in explicitly anti-Christian music.

Brian had originally intended on using this song as a Love and Death song, but after Jonathan Davis heard it, they decided to make it a Korn song with Davis providing vocals as opposed to Brian, which is what wouldve happened had it been a Love and Death song. The producer Jasen Rauch had produced the entire Between Here And Lost album released by Love and Death, and so he was included in producing this song as well.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Feelings you see are so hard to believe
All the chaos I have in my heart
Devils I make and the love can't relate
All the solace inside tears me up

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me away, set me on fire
There's no other way

[Chorus]
Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained
I'm so lost and lonely now

[Verse 2]
Weaving deceits is so easy for me
'Cause the loathing I've had from the start
Evil disease, all the hatred it breeds
As I'm down on my knees, torn apart

Where do I run? Where do I hide?

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]

I'm never gonna be refined

Sure, we have come far in time
(Watch the bow break)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I'm sorry I don't believe
By the evidence that I see
That there's any hope left for me
It's evolution, just evolution

[Chorus 1]
And I, I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind
And why do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by this animal that's locked up inside

[Verse 2]
Close up to get a real good view
I'm betting that the species will survive
Pull back, I'm getting inside you

And when we're gonna find these bones
They're gonna wanna keep them in a jar

It was released as the lead single from Korns eleventh studio album, The Paradigm Shift, on August 12, 2013. It marks the first Korn single with original co-founding guitarist Brian Head Welch since 2004.



Never Never has been described by Jonathan Davis stating, Its a relationship song. You go through that shit and you get hurt so bad. Then you think, Its not worth it anymore. Im not going to fucking love again. You experience so many pressures to be a good dad, a good husband, a good lover, or whatever. Being in a relationship is a lot of work.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I'll never love again
I won't ever have to pretend
I'm never gonna love again
Damn!

[Verse 1]
I don't ever wanna have to try
And though I lie it never flies
I don't ever wanna have to die
But deep inside the death it hides
And I never wanna clarify
And justify, so I run and hide
And I never wanna signify
So I pacify all the hate inside

[Chorus]
(No-o-o-o) I'll never love again
(No-o-o-o) I won't ever have to pretend
(No-o-o-o) I'm never gonna love again
Never gonna have to try to pretend
Never, never, never

[Verse 2]
I don't ever wanna satisfy
'Cause things inside are doing fine
I don't ever wanna multiply
'Cause deep inside, I'm not qualified
And I never wanna clarify
And justify, so I run and hide
And I never wanna signify
So I pacify all the hate inside

Title: Cameltosis
Release Date: August 18, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-cameltosis-lyrics
Song Description: Cameltosis is the twelfth song in Korns third studio album Follow The Leader, it features Tre Hardson from Pharcyde.

This song finds Jonathan Davis reflecting on how hes been scarred by a previous relationship. He explained:

Thats a love song. Its about women in general, women who hurt me. Its Tres lyrics. Hes going on about chicks, and my chorus is like Im so scared to love anyone and really let them in after I got hurt really really bad by a girl. Ive let Renee (then fianc) in a little bit, to be honest, but Ill never be that in love ever again. Thats what Im saying, now matter now many times youve loved, once or twice, youre gonna get fucked, cause you usually do eventually.

Davis explained the made-up song title: The word Cameltosis is a joke. You know, like how girls get camel toes when they pull their pants up too high in their crotch? We call it camel toes.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Slimkid3]
Yeah, huh

[Verse 1: Slimkid3]
I should've learned it from the start what I was in for
She break a tin full, she copied, we exchanged some info

And things, no shame, two sparks turned into flames
Nympho's in the park, just dancing in the rain
Hook me with this fix and look to drain my aim
Some never retain what wouldn't suck from your veins

Choose your path, and there's your truth, follow
Carve an inch, and here comes the sorrow

Fight all you can, and they are complacent
Nothing you do can make it all go away (Make it go away)

Their shadow starts to cast out

Roll the dice, your number never comes up
Pay the price, and still your life's fucked up

Led astray, it's laughing 'cause it led you there
Yet again, you can't make it go away (Go away)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
My brother, you love her
But don't give up your instincts
Hang onto you know what
They'll be gone fast as you blink
They're trained to seduce you
Suck you dry quick as they can
They bite down, reduce you
Now you're barely a man

[Chorus]
Oh my God
How could you deny the flood
That's flowing through you?
Hey you, you're saying that
She's all that you desire, liar
Hey you, you think you can
Throw water on this fire, liar

[Verse 2]
It's not wrong to let go
And let the woman ride you
For fuck sake, don't lose touch
With the dog that's inside you
She wanted what you had
You bet she smelt the spore
Don't wimp up, fuck her up

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes, fall asleep
Broken promises that you'll never keep
Drift away tonight, just drift away, alright?
We used to dream, we used to laugh
No one could tell us that this would never last
This ain't a love song, I would never give you one

[Pre-Chorus]
No more secrets, no more lies
No more feelings or surprise
No more whispered words or lullabies
Go fuck your lies

[Chorus]
Everything, everything falls with us
Everything, everything all we've had
Everything, everything falls all apart

[Verse 2]
I'd given up, it's all I could take
My hands are shaking, my body could break
Eyes, they lower now, come on and take me out
I used to care, I used to try
But what's the use? It always ends with goodbye
This ain't a love song, I'd never give you one

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Itty-bitty, oh so pretty as I watch myself break down
Satisfying, as l'm crying, watch the vomit hit the ground
I am just a shadow of the man I once used to be
Everything I ever loved is always taken back from me

[Chorus]
The feeling of this loss keeps creeping
Ingesting any joy that I might find
It’s tearing at my heart (It's killing me)
It's robbing me of something I once
Had to take it, now I hate it, it won’t ever stop

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna take it back, I want it, I want it
I wanna take it back, I want it, I want it
I wanna take it back, I want it, I want it
I wanna take it back, I want it, I want it

[Verse 2]
There's nothing like the sound of screaming, looping up all in my mind
Horrid pictures of the past invading my pineal high
I am just a shadow of the man I once used to be
Everything I ever loved is always taken back from me
Always taken back from me

This is plain to see
Been holding on too long to this tragedy
And it's time to be free
To understand what this path's laid out for me
So here I am again
Happiness is a club I’ll never be in
I’ll never be in, I'll never get in, I’ll never get in

It runs away, it's so predictable

Too blind to see emptiness and sorrow of their lives
They run away to the cover of their pointless ties
You axe me, it's so predictable

Silence overwhelms my mind

Title: Finally Free
Release Date: September 13, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-finally-free-lyrics
Song Description: The lyrics of The Nothing mainly deal with the loss of Deven Davis, wife of singer Jonathan Davis and mother of his children, who died of a drug overdose  on August 17, 2018 at the age of 39 years. Finally Free describes Jonathans grief, mixed with the small comfort that she finally is freed from the burden of battling addiction. In an interview with Revolver Mag, guitarist James Munky Shaffer chooses this song as his favorite from the album and explains:
Its totally relating to his wife and her death. She went through so much. Him and her together as a family went through so much, and if you know anybody who has battled with addiction, like I have and like so many of us in this band have, you sometimes feel like you cant shake those demons. Shes finally free, which is essentially how we got the title of the song.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]

Song Description: The Ringmaster deals with the imbalace between Jonathan and the voice in his head.

The chorus stands as Jonathan within his current situation, wanting to leave and go to a better place. The verses, however, represent the voice in his head and what it says to him.

The voice (which can be thought of as the title of the album the nothing) says comforting things to Jonathan, such as you have nothing to fear and lets talk and let it out as a way to try and manipulate him into giving into the darkness, this is seen in the first verse. When Jonathan doesnt give in, however, it starts telling him meaner things in the second verse, like youre so willing to hurt and everything you feel wont make it better.

Jonathan is aware of this voices manipulative ways, hence what he says in the bridge.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Hey, you
Yes, I'm talking to you
And what are you doing here?
And why you look so sad, man?
Brother, please come here
Let’s talk and let it out
Dear, you have nothing to fear
Child, I'm the one that makes it, oh, so, so much better

[Chorus]
I feel your presence standing there up in my face
I feel the darkness haunting me with its embrace
I want to shed this, go to a place, a different time
The plot unfolds, this meaning here I'll never find

[Post-Chorus]
(Never, never find, never find, never find, never
Never find, never find, never find)

[Verse 2]
Hey, man
What do we have here?
You’re looking so upset
You're making it quite clear
That you want nothing to change
'Cause you're so willing to hurt, and
Feel at home in the dark, boy
Everything you feel, child, won't make it better

Nothing's left, you're dead on the ground
How can I covet you?

Lyrics:

[Verse]
Lost alone here in the dark
Looking for answers I will never find, I'll never find
God knew all along that He would take you
And the demons were set loose to claim their prize, I am their prize
Everywhere I turn, I can't escape you
Did everything I could to hide
For every good thing I've done, there's a price to pay
And that price has left me horrified, God, I tried
Now I'm the one who never chose this
Now I'm the one who walked a narrow line
And I would do anything to bring you back to me
If only God would let me turn back time

It makes me drop to my knees (Ah-ah, oh-oh)
What must I do to appease? My effort's scalded
I guess I'll have to concede

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight
Throw away the key
And then turn out all the lights
First we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
And when he comes a-sniffing
We will snap the trap and close the gate
Wait I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

[Chorus]
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for 90 years
Then see if he talks!
Then Mr. Oogie Boogie man!
Can take the whole thing over then!
He'll be so pleased I do declare!
That he will cook him rare!

[Verse 2]
I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door, and then...
Knock 3 times and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more
You're so stupid think now
If we blow him up to smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And then Jack will beat us black and green

Because Mr. Oogie Boogie
Is the meanest guy around
If I were on his Boogie list
I'd get out of town
He'll be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I bet
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew
We're his little henchman
And we take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And to stay on his good side
I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
I'm not the dumb one
You're no fun
Shut up!
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now in the box we'll wait and hide
Until his curiosity entices him to look inside
And then we'll have him
One, two, three
[Chorus]
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick
Lock him for 90 years
See what makes him tick
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
See what we will see!
Lock him in a cage
And then throw away the key!
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
See what we will see!
Lock him in a cage
And then throw away the key!2Embed

It's like insanity is hanging on a thread

Who knows if it's really better?
I threw it out for some parts

Welcoming sight from the past
Somehow they make me feel something
Even if it doesn't last

Title: Throw Me Away
Release Date: December 6, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/Korn-throw-me-away-lyrics
Song Description: The lyrics begin with the idea that a Flesh wound can be treated and disregarded, and becomes harsh criticism of those who only sees a person in regards to the health of their body.

The chorus goes so far as to compare a victimized human as a scratched CD.

The bridge makes the argument that a persons persona is inherently broken, it loses a bit each fracture and becomes less human the more adhesive/medication is applied.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Flesh wound, flesh wound
With medication, it will fade
Should I assume
That someone hears me when I pray?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Love, full of hate
Don't you love
How I break?

[Chorus]
Don't let them throw me away!

Keep me and I'll be okay!
