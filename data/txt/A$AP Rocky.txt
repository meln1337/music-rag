Artist: A$AP Rocky, Alternate Names: Rakim Mayers, Rakim A. Mayers, Rakim Athelaston Mayers, Lord Flacko Jodye II, PMF, Pretty Motherfucker, Pretty Flacko, Lord Flacko, Lord Pretty Flacko JODYE, Flacko
Artist Description: Rakim Athelaston Mayers (named after “The God MC” Rakim), better known by his stage name, A$AP Rocky, hails from Harlem, New York. He is no stranger to the cliché rap lifestyle, popularized by fellow Harlem Patriarchs, from Big L and Kool Moe Dee to Mase and Cam'ron. However, Rocky’s melodic rap style has drawn more immediate comparisons to recently incarcerated Harlemite Max B.

Rocky’s career began in 2007, when he joined the Harlem-based A$AP Mob, founded by A$AP Yams, A$AP Bari and A$AP Illz. Rocky was projected into fame in 2011 following the release of his debut mixtape LIVE.LOVE.A$AP, which featured hits like “Peso” and “Purple Swag,” and earned him a record deal with RCA Records.

His debut studio album, Long. Live. A$AP was released in 2013, after several pushbacks by his label. Long.Live.A$AP was thought to exceed the promises of his debut mixtape, preserving Rocky’s immaculate taste while smartly upgrading his sound.

After month’s of teasing projects, one of which included a completely experimental instrumental album, Rocky returned with the Juicy J aided track “Multiply” in 2014, as well as “Lord Pretty Flacko Joyde” on New Year’s 2015. Both of these tracks served as promotional singles for Flacko next record, AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP. Before the album’s release however, long-time friend and mentor A$AP Yams passed due to an overdose, which left a huge mark on Rakim ever since. The album was released on May 26th 2015, following a leak one week prior to its initial release date. Upon its release, AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP received generally positive to mixed reviews from music critics, including praises for the psychedelic anthem “L$D”.

After a brief hiatus from solo music, and an increasing indulgence into fashion and art, Rocky announced that he was working on an upcoming studio album entitled TESTING. On May 25, 2018, the album was released and was met with mixed reviews, primarily due to the album being Rocky’s most experimental project yet.

Flacko’s music can be characterised by its lucid and cloud-like feeling, though Rocky never hesitates to drop bars when he needs to. It is also thought that Rocky has some of the best music videos in the game.

However, being a staple in new-school hip-hop, Rocky’s success and accolades aren’t limited to music. He’s widely acclaimed for his impeccable fashion sense, and was named one of the most influential names in fashion of 2017. He was even featured on the cover of a 2017 issue of GQ magazine, and labeled as the “World’s Flyest Human.” He also established his own creative collective/record label AWGE in the same year.

Title: Fuckin’ Problems
Release Date: October 24, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/A-ap-rocky-fuckin-problems-lyrics
Song Description: This all-star posse cut showcases three distinctive rappers trying to out-stunt each other on the subject of fucking bad bitches. Rocky called the song a reunion of Drakes 2012 Club Paradise Tour, which featured Rocky, Kendrick Lamar, and 2 Chainz as opening acts.

Fuckin Problems began as a collaboration between Drake and 2 Chainz, when a line from the latter inspired the nascent songs concept and hook. Drake and longtime producer Noah 40 Shebib, who were also working on a posthumous Aaliyah album at the time, interpolated unreleased vocal samples from the late singer to form the basis of the beat.

According to Drake, the aggressive nature of the song was a response to Kendrick and those who tried to categorize him as a soft artist:

It was actually Kendricks record first. He had asked me to get on Poetic Justice, and again I was like, Oh, Poetic Justice. Its a great song, but its the typical, you know, Im going to be on the soft girls song on the album. So it was like, Let me give you some shit.

Drake submitted the song for inclusion on Kendricks good kid, m.A.A.d city album, but it was ultimately not included because it didnt fit with the LPs narrative.

The song finally found a home with A$AP Rocky, who released it as the second single in advance of his 2013 debut Long. Live. A$AP. According to Rocky, he was under pressure to deliver a hit. The expectations for me [were] almost unfair, and unrealistic, he says. I just wanted [a song] to really back up that hype.

Despite its explicit lyrics and title, Fuckin Problems was a major success on radio, eventually becoming a top 10 pop hit and Rockys most successful song to date. A video directed by Sam Lecca and Clark Jackson, and featuring all four artists, was released.

After the song became a major success, Drake reflected on his choice to give it away:


Most people would be like, Oh, were going to save this for six, seven months, until my album comes out. For me its, well, Im going to give this song to someone who is popping now. Were all on tour now. Its a big record. It needs to come out in the next two months. I made that personal decision.

Sure, I sacrificed the record. Maybe theyll think Im crazy. But Im very present in the rap game even when Im working on an album. What I do is pick five or six songs and disperse out and say, This is going to keep me very much alive in peoples minds for the next year.

Lyrics:

[Produced by Hit-Boy]
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar—
Dee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed, then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "Doo, doo," I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm, mmm!"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9s on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P., I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed to
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed to, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
You might also like[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body-double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait! No, I don't give a
Flying duck nothin' but a buckshot; ch-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood-clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show—Yelawolf
[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this
Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?
[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin', I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham
[Verse 7: Big K.R.I.T.]
Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample, nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass (on your wifey's ass)
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist392Embed

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Get it
Text a message, I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady takin' shots, but never hurtin' numbers
Even then, y'all don't worry nothin'
And I'd like to give a shout out to my niggas with a game plan
And shout outs all my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We could either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this
Time to go, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowin', chart-climbing on 'em
You'd think I'm jumpin' out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner, line 'em up the block and over
Sometimes I even stop the smokin' when it's time to focus
My shades, Dior, my pants, velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law

The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine

Title: Goldie
Release Date: April 16, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/A-ap-rocky-goldie-lyrics
Song Description: First single off of Rockys much-anticipated, freshman album Long.Live.A$AP.

It may be called Goldie as that was the name of the pimp in The Mack.

Fun Fact: According to Hit-Boy, this beat was originally intended for Jay Z.

Rocky told Complex:

I was in L.A. recording with Hit-Boy. We was going through some tracks. He was going through some tracks he had made for Jay-Z. He goes, You ever hear this? He let me hear it. I go, Let me get that, and he let me have that record. I spit to it, and it was like, This beat was made for you. Thats just how it worked. With Goldie I just really wanted to show people a different side of me. I wanted to show them something jiggy. Some tastemaker shit.

The Alternate Cover Art:
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Aha, aha
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Verse 1]
Let's take it to the basics, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'ma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad 'cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up to money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, "Tell it to my face"
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

I be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell my niggas quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected plus I'm well connected
With this coke that I imported, just important as your President
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Blowing blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't 'round my clique for nothing
'Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing

[Chorus]
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos (Pesos)

Lyrics:

[Chorus: Rod Stewart & Miguel]
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign

Here I go, here I go, here I go

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits (Yeah)
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord, forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (Yeah)
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit (Uh-huh), I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, "Holler if ya need some dick"
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

Wake up feeling blessed up, pistol on that dresser
Ain't afraid to show it, I'll expose it if I dress up
Riding in that Testa...rossa, nigga catch up
Sipping on that syrup, till I'm messed up, like yes sir
So now I'm getting change, people looking at me strange

We walk around with lasers, you prolly own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us

[Verse 2]
Finna wild out for the weekend, me, myself, and I – my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, A$AP niggas finna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it, A$AP we the trillest
You don't really want that Glock boy

Title: L$D
Release Date: May 19, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/A-ap-rocky-l-d-lyrics
Song Description: This song and accompanying video were released on May 19 by Lil B on Twitter. Rocky later tweeted THANK YOU BASED GOD.

The song is both an ode to the drug LSD (commonly known as acid) and his love affairs with women. Rocky spoke on his love for all women during many interviews leading up to the release of this album.

Speaking to the New York Post, Rocky opened up about his latest drug of choice, LSD, citing a strong psychedelic influence it had on A.L.L.A..

Despite the drug-induced death of his partner and mentor A$AP Yams in January 2015, Rocky remains unapologetic for routinely indulging in drugs and women. Yams died of an accidental overdose of prescription-grade cough syrup and benzodiazepines (Xanax).

The music video was co-directed by Dexter Navy and A$AP Rocky. It also features a verse from his song Excuse Me. The song contains a sample of Ode to Billy Joe by Lou Donaldson.

The trippy atmosphere of the whole video is inspired by Enter The Void movie, directed by Gaspar No.
Lyrics:

I know I dream about her all day (Uh)
I think about her with her clothes off (Uh, uh)
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD (Uh, uh)
I look for ways to say, "I love you" (Uh)
But I ain't into makin' love songs (Uh)
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD (Uh, uh)
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid, uh)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night (Uh, uh)
Them other drugs just don't fit me right (Uh, uh)
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Another quarter to the face system (Uh, uh)
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love (Acid)
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams (Uh, acid, uh)

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
'Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feelin' for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"

[Intro]
Uh

[Verse 1]
I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching, fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding, hide your kittens, hit your childrens with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hardheaded, never listen
Purp-purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians (Uh)
The land of no religion (Uh)
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my Benjis and my Bentley
And them bitches now I gets-gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit 'til I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me
[Chorus]
Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course, I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force

Niggas talking down
Never talk to cops
Make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Then stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back, I'm talking 'bout your mom (Uh)
'Cause there's killers in my town (Uh)
Making hits, sniffing lines (Yeah)

Wait for shit to simmer down (Uh)
Corrupted little minds (Yeah)

Strangers make me nervous
Who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?

Song Description: In this song Rocky looks deep into his career, the affects its having on him, and how things couldve been much worse off. He looks at society as a whole, and at the people that compose it, and observes how we have/can destroy one another with nothing more than our words.

As annotated in the outro, the Phoenix is seen to be a symbol of rebirth, this hinting at the possibility that Rocky is trying to reinvent himself.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized
Fuck Illuminati lies, say I'm lucified
Baptized in the gutter, motherfucker you decide
Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores, they be super-sized
Good and bad having wars, nigga, choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I? Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures, call me Basquiat, Picasso
Capo Head Hancho, now my following's colossal
Ain't no boxer, Pacquiao, but got the chopper todo caso
It's like you heard God spoke, I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle, goodnight folks

[Verse 2]
Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied, still was crucified
That's why I never judge another nigga
Life's a bitch, but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed, sheets, no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen, no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas, wassup with niggas?
So my new attitude is like "Fuck them niggas!"
I grew up with niggas but don't fuck with niggas
I don't trust them niggas, ain't got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla, now the whole world fuckin' with us
Meanwhile, you treated all of us like other niggas
Now your world is in my palm, take cover niggas

If I shall ever fall, Lord pick me up
Ever since a baby, two deuce in sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zip-me-ups
Now I'm walking on my own, y'all, wish me luck

[Outro]
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan200Embed

[Produced by Hector Delgado, Frans Mernick, and A$AP Rocky]

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Yeah, live through the strugglin', life's a every day (Hustle)
I hustle every day in life, thinkin' back
Takin' packs up the block, them older niggas said I couldn't (Hustle)
Man fuck them niggas, I'll be back, strapped backpack
Bitch, I'm flippin' work, hand in hand, I think they call it track (Hustle)
Racin' laps, re-up went to waste, it pays to make it stack
Face the fact, there's always niggas out there, tryin' to knock the (Hustle)
I guess that's why they say we trap, don't let niggas hold you back
I'm just a kettle from the ghetto with no pot to piss in
So who am I to call it black? Black man, black male
Black ball, black opsy, black diamonds glistenin' (Yeah)
Attract the pigs and all the rats, kitten scratch
I went from roaches on my bump to red brooches on the cuff
Of my tux, chauffeur pullin' up, no if, and's​ or buts about him
I went to Paris for my trunks, 100 thousand spent on Goyard
Used 'em once, couldn't give a shit, damn or fuck about 'em
Hit Canal Street, vintage gold medallion
Smokin' blunts in front of public housin'
Wildin' 'til they throw me in them cuffs
Mouth full of fronts, look like Master P up in my Cartiers (Uh)
Diamonds shinin' in the frames
Changed the game and made them say (Uh)
Ain't no limits to this shit, life's a flick, you're stickin' to the script
My life is like a movie, they should film me through it
Take a pic', be sure to frame the shit, forever me, was always G
Way before this famous shit, y'all just pretend to do it

Rap game like the crack game, swear it's all the same (Hustle)
Whippin' soda through the pot, watch it bubble
Flexin' muscle, hit the block, I bet I teach you niggas how to (Hustle)
Sellin' coca on the charts, watch it double
Uh, takin' meetings on my bus, this shit my mobile office
Gettin' head while at my desk, this shit my oval office
I remember when I got a hundred for recordings
Now the sum of my performances just put me on the Forbes list
Fuck jiggy, I'm flawless, fuck pretty, I'm gorgeous
Your favorite rappers' corpses couldn't measure my importance
My mind is out in orbits, plus my ego got endorsements
Heard the people want that raw shit, but y'all be talkin' bullshit

I might pull up with 3K but I do not fuck with no Klans

Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexin' the same
I'm done with adjustin' to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang
It's time to fuck up the whole game!

[Verse]
Come fuck with the Mob, shout out to the Lords and the Gods
In love with my bitch 'cause she bi
My ice like the stars, I tell that bitch, "Cover your eyes
'Cause fuckin' with me, you go blind"
She losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark, I kill you, you open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Like dominos, nigga, Geronimos
When it's my time to go, adiós, vámonos
Flacko no Dominicano, but eat the tostones with plátanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin', shit, I suppose
I'm on my live alone, die VLONE
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose

I fucked your boo on her back

[Chorus]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang
It's time to fuck up the whole game! (Game, game, game, game)

Lyrics:

[Part I]

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothin' at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but who will lean if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know (Yeah)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say you never happened
I mean, I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashin', left her sleepin' on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like, "Flacko, where your ass been?
Heard you done with fashion, now your ass is acting"
I'm trippin' off the acid, now your ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in vintage Tommy and some mid Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music make me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture, changed hip-hop on you
Smoking like a rasta was my pop's culture
I be damned if I die sober, I'll be sure to visit 'Pac for you
You might also like[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothin' at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know (Uh, uh)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
And shout outs my pretty womens in the spot tonight
Let me see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Bimmers and the Benz, come again
When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
'Cause I be playin' with these womens like they sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, 'cause it's droppin' next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, "I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden"
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
Uh, that touch-your-soul music, I get you higher
Grab your lighter fluid, might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid
Even Montell can't tell you how we do it
Sit back and watch me do it
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothin' at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know
[Part II]
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Okay, let's get past all the swag trappin' and fashion talkin'
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rappin' talkin'
They rap impulsive, get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughin' off it
I changed rap, pushed fashion forward, yeah, I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both actin' awkward?
Jigglin' baby, nah, go 'head, bitch
Ain't nothin' better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ayy, just play it like I didn't tell you
Niggas takin' pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away just one day like some love birds
Only one word that I'm afraid of is the "Love" word
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lonely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
What's up, bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who need friends?
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Oh, man, remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man, everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ayy, bitch, you missed out, #fomo
I got one child, one child
But I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more
They wanna throw me under a white jail
'Cause I'm a black man with confidence of a white male

You know us big mouth Harlem niggas don't know how to act

Hoes all on my bandwagon, your bitch gagging, she jet lagging

Ridin' 'round with that mask on

Titan full of that hydro, pretty nigga, no catwalk
Big burner in your big mouth, pussy niggas suck lead off

Got it jumping like Kriss Kross, mismatching, no jigsaw
No horseplay when we quick draw, pussy nigga get a tit job
Hands up, stick your mans up, your time's up, the new brand's up

In January 2019, he told GQ magazine:

[The song] was inspired by a situation I had where my face got cut, and I started walking around with a babushka to cover it. It was about last September. It started with a yellow one when I was on Trevor Noahs show. I actually did a Vogue shoot the day after I got my face slashed.

Rocky first previewed Babushka Boi during his 2019 Injured Generation tour.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Uh
They call me F-L-A-C-K-O and don't play, no, 'bout my papes
Baked potato on that Draco, new bandana on my face
Ain't no stains up on my drapes, squeaky clean, fuck you say?
Peep them teeth, no dentures please
Princess cut, no dentist, please
Say cheese for the cameras (Ayy)
Eight Gs for the dancers (Ayy)
Benjis in the safe (That's right, ayy)
Bentleys for the phantoms (Uh)
But they all go to waste (Uh)
So what more can I say?
Praise to the Lord, give him grace
The scar on my face
But w-wait

[Interlude]
(​ecafracS ,sruoy si dlrow ehT)
The world is yours, Scarface, nigga
(​ecafracS ,sruoy si dlrow ehT)

[Verse 2]
I ain't duckin' niggas, I ain't duckin' bullets either
Shit, I ain't duck sauce since I became a vegan
Nigga, Flacko Jodye season
Prada pants before the season
Probably ducked off in a quiet place wit' ya breezy
Prada shades, that's probably why you couldn't see him
Shittin' me? (Boy)

The world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate this
To the scar on my face
Many stars on the globe

[Verse 3]
Uh, fuck no, this ain't no hookah
Smokin' while I'm strollin' down Wooster
Buck fifty, my babushka
No pistol poppers and prostituters
Card scammers and the Prada boosters
Low top, yeah, the powder blue ones
Robber too, huh? Power to ya
Hallelujah, better pray to God

[Chorus]
I would like to dedicate
To the scar on my face
All the stars of the globe
The world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate this
To the scar on my face
Many stars of the globe

Bitches lickin' and lockin' up my Swishers
Once she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal
Spread the news, I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel (Uh)
Before I get aggressive, forget it, war-ready
Already tested, tears and blood invested
'Til my cardiac's arrested and my 40 ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that (Uh)
Black magic on the tires, only I
Roll— Rollin' down a lonely mile, phony smile
Warrants, police on me now, still tourin'
And my chain, it may slow me down, cheer for it
Pain in its purest form
Don't complain, I came to reign from here forward
Still 'noid, so the crib got clear doors
Burnin' planes in my Air Force

Mm, enjoy, when I get annoyed
Know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid
Body get found by a little fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenigga, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a 'roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
Fuck talking, how fast you could grip a nine?
Damn
Look at how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit to crime
These niggas had the sidewalk sippin' wine
Guess that's why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq' so I soak in, lift and shine
Tip-tip and toe, I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil' for these freakin' lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin' lies
How many times your eyes seen a nigga die?
Never
Spittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better, nigga126Embed

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]

Damn, how a young nigga get so nice?
Young nigga cold like he sitting on ice
Fuck broke, tryna be rich all life

My nuts hanging, my top back
Hoes screaming that Pac back
Throwing Westside, bandana tied
A$AP life, got a Pac tat
Harlem world my whole block strapped
Hoes all on my jock strap
My whip white but my top black
And my bitch white but my cock black
Purple drink? Got that
Tell these hoes all to twerk something
Bounce on me bitch, hurt something
Tell her pop that pussy like it's worth something
So shorty, she a stunner and daddy, he a runner
Be that pretty mothafucka, you could call me what you wanna
Cause I'm in love with that ass, she in love with the cash
So she shaking it fast and then making them stacks
And I'm taking it back and I'm taking her back
To the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kicking her out

If you fucked her once, then you could fuck her twice
And don't get head from hoes with overbites
Just giving out game, nigga show your right
Born stunna nigga, turn night to bright

Made 30 Racks it was just a flight
Flew a bitch out too, it was just a night

Try again and then again and she ain't telling me no

Title: Purple Swag
Release Date: July 5, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/A-ap-rocky-purple-swag-lyrics
Song Description: About recording the song, Rocky told Complex:

We definitely recorded that shit in some small ass closet. I was getting high. I was high as a kite. On some purple drink, purple weed, shouts to this weed. It just felt so natural. Holy shit. I was in a world where everything was purple. I was just high. Purple lights was everywhere. It was just like, dark room, purple lights. Music blasting. That type of shit. Everything is purple. Swag.

A prime example from the young Harlem spitter is this new video for his latest audible titled Purple Swag. Its a song dedicated to the Houston rappers, always rapping about that purple drank (otherwise known as purple lean or codeine syrup).

This song samples:


Stay with Me by Clint Mansell (feat. the Kronos Quartet):
The soundtrack from Mortal Kombat 3.
Lyrics:

That pimp shit, she ain't plan to fuck, I pick her up, I still hit
That's swag, bitch

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Mike Jones]
"I said"
Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

That purple swag, purple swag, that purple smoke up in my clothes
That big booty, juicy fruity, yellow bone, I wanna bone
I'm getting dome, I took her out, dick in her mouth, she getting on
I'm flexing steel, I'm flexing still, I'm sitting high, I'm tipping slow
I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow

Title: Angels
Release Date: January 15, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/A-ap-rocky-angels-lyrics
Song Description: Angels is a reminder of A$AP Rockys violent and drug-filled childhood and life before fame, as is much of LONG.LIVE.A$AP.  Through his hustle  selling marijuana and then crack cocaine at 15  he can now stand as a small-time drug lord.  His ability to survive in dire times and come up as a prominent rapper have earned him the title as an idolized father figure for youngsters.

The track also serves as a tribute to the young kids who traffic Rockys drugs for him, going as far as calling them his angels.  By Rocky referring to his worker bees as angels, he may be implying that he is like a god to them.

Title: Purity
Release Date: May 25, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/A-ap-rocky-purity-lyrics
Song Description: Purity is the final track on A$AP Rockys album, TESTING, and the second track to feature Frank Ocean. Purity finds an introspective Rocky looking back on his life of fame and realizing how his busy lifestyle has made it difficult for him to find time for himself and his family.

The song prominently features a pitched sample from Lauryn Hills MTV Unplugged No. 2.0-classic I Gotta Find Peace of Mind, which explains Hills credit on the song.
Lyrics:

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
I've been busy (Busy, busy)
I've been fuckin' busy, I've been busy fuckin'
I've been all kinds of busy, or sorta kinda busy
Like shorty is we fuckin'? Well if not then fuck it
Apologies to the fam, we thought we ducked 'em
Said I was in a rush but I was busy rushin'
It's busy shit, busy that, busy this
And I need a minute (Hold on)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, A$AP Rocky, and Frank Ocean]
See this what that voice in your head says
When you try to get peace of mind
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Ooh, going to find)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (I'm going to find)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean & Lauryn Hill]
Spendin' time spinnin' out toward a desire that wasn't pure
Born before the virus was cured, pitch perfect, violins on the floor
Fast forward, linings on my skull (This what that voice in your head says when you try to get piece of mind)
This the type of design I could afford
Fast forward, bands out
Got they hands out like they acknowledgin' the Führer (I gotta f-)
I rewind, Nas track 6, rewind dance crazes
Read my mind, freed my mind, feed my mind, makes sense
Just like mirrors on the wall, just like sittin' on me (This what that voice in your head says when you try to get piece of mind)
Raw in mirrors seen it all, could make two, a piece of mind (I gotta f-)
Flickin' ash, pourin' a half, don't pour in a glass
Pour it in foam, this white got eggshells in my omelet
My earlobes, they yellow like the yolk is runnin'
Brain on drugs, I still ain't got no peace of mind, fuck
Woof, woof—dogs in the place, loose tooth—lost in the fray
Roof lost on the Wraith, roof lost on the way
Freeway, no Rozay, brute force, Brüt champagne
Tell the front desk to cut new keys
Reserved in the Mercer for two years, in two suites
Took out the bed like it's fuck sleep
I'll smack a bitch like it's hot hands
Fired the label like fuck brands
Comfortable low nigga, fuck Xans
Comfortable slow, who the fuck ran
Nothin' is sweet, nothin' in tank sweet, it's just a tank P
Salt on a slug, soda on slugged teeth, chewing on nothing
You're tweakin' or somethin', you're reachin' for somethin'
You're speakin', speak up then, you're thinkin', you’re overthinkin'
One blink and I'm pre-cummin'
That could turn every no one into someone

"I gotta find peace of mind" (Oh, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Oh, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (You make my desire pure)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (You make my desire pure)
I just need peace of mind for my purity
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky and Lauryn Hill]
Memories burn the roaches
Cheer Hennessy for my old heads
Amphetamines for the dosage
Keepin' me up and focused
Jewelry cloth, my gold caps
NY throwback like the old Fab (I'm undone because)
Lost in the Google Maps in your iMac, think my phone tapped
Hold up, hold that (Hold on, my nigga, hold that—) (I'm undone because) thought
Nigga, pour up soda, nigga, hold that cough, tryna hold back
The call had dropped when the FaceTime paused (I'm undone because), don't call back
Can't cope when your heart broke
Soft-spoken, roll somethin', cop somethin', Narco
Saint like Joan of Arc, bro, ring barcode
Two of everything, should have been to blame when Noah's Ark broke (I'm undone because)
Two more drinks of everything before the bar closed
Face-to-face with my demons at a barstool
Haven't checked on my niece in weeks
Months past and months in between since me and my sister would speak
Not a call or visit in weeks
Lost nothin' since September
Last seen her September '16
Man it feels like (I'm undone because)
Lose someone every release, it feels like the curse is in me (A$AP)
Press is gone and I grief, I share with you my peace
[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
"I'm undone because—"
"I'm undone because—"

Had to get entitled motherfuckers out the way
Had to take another title, sorry for the wait (Oop)

Tap the vein, whoa, barely look like I'm awake
Darker shades, bluer veins, bluer money in the bankroll

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'

Eyes lookin' like he rollin'
Got new bags under my eyelids
New bags up in my closets
New bags like I went shoppin'
New bags on new bags
Mind's better at seeing two now (Ah, down)
Needing up on my downtime (Down, down)
Hit the waves with the new sound (Down, down)
House tunes but it's screwed down
That's dope (Sauce)
Take a sec to thank the Lord, 'nother one to call my folks
Hit my momma on the phone, she like "Son, you the boss" (Ah)

Lyrics:

[Intro: A$AP Rocky & T.I.]
Gang! Gang
They tryna front on the gang!
They going to remember my name
Ayy, anybody ever took the time to ask Rocky what A$AP mean to him?
Well if so, he'll probably tell you, "Always Striving and Prospering"
A$AP, partna'! Free my nigga, Cap
R.I.P. Big Phil, R.I.P. A$AP Yams
Ya dig? (Gang!)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Come fuck with the Mob, shout out to the Lords and the Gods
In love with my bitch 'cause she bi
My ice like the stars, I tell that bitch, "Cover your eyes
'Cause fuckin' with me, you go blind"
She losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark, I kill you, you open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Like dominos, nigga, Geronimos
When it's my time to go, adiós, vámonos
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with plátanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin', shit, I suppose
I'm on my live alone, die VLONE
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose

I got Goyard by the sack (Woo)
I got the boof by the pack (Woo)
I fucked your boo in her back

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang, it's time to fuck up the whole game!

(Hmm-hmm-hmm)
(Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm)
(Hmm-hmm-hmm)
Hmm

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I'm free as a bird, I wanted this shit my whole life
But had all this stress on my mind
Until I realized, things pan out when it's right
In the meantime I'ma grind
I think of them days when I was so young on my plight
Party and bullshit and play
Was up in the city, the one that's surrounded by lights
Wanted to burn it away
Get out of his lane, got no time, don't need no advice
Except for my momma
Ride for my daughter, she's all I need
She got her father, as I grow
Hell yeah, I did it, I'm on a roll
Thought I'd be over my nigga, no
I'm just gettin' warmed up, let's start the show
I'm schoolin' these niggas, so in the zone and I'm rigged to blow
A$AP and Cud Life forever though
And I'm flossin' and bossin' these silly hoes
Learned the codes, serve up the magic for all of those
Kids that ain't had someone on they own
Hang on the words, you each have your song
Grab on and hold on, won't steer you wrong
Sing along, sing along, hmm
[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I put A$AP on my tat (Woo)
I put New York on the map (Woo)
I put the gang on the flames (Woo)
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains (Woo)
I got Goyard by the sack (Woo)
I got the boof by the pack (Woo)
I fucked your boo in her back (Woo)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang, it's time to fuck up the whole game!
(Game, game, game, game)

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky & Khloe Anna]
Gang, gang
They tryna front on the gang, they gon' remember my name
True to truth somehow (Gang, gang)
But never truly lied at all, then and now
They tryna front on the gang
Truth somehow
Gang, A$AP boys come with the flame
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow

But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Clams Casino, A$AP (Wassup)
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup, hey)
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup, hey)

[Verse 1]
Back once again, sipping Henn', mixed with juice and gin
Bitches in, couple lady friends countin' Benjamins
Spinners spin on them twenty twins, that Mercedes Benz
Dividends made a change of plans, well that all depends
Shout-out my parolees and I smoke that OG
Kush motherfuck' the police, all my niggas rock gold teeth
So hood and we so street, sippin' on that codeine
We hustle hard, no sleep, your bitch loose, that's no leash
I ain't talking 'bout no money, I ain't talking 'bout no cars
Talking 'bout no diamonds 'cause that shit is a façade
Times is really hard, I fucked a couple broads
Smoked some purple out the jars, let me tell you who we are

[Pre-Chorus]
I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell 'em quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell 'em quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second

See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight, but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles, and overbites
But I'm pimping, nigga: Dolemite
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce, two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme
What's up, what's on your mind? Hold up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers
I'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me
I'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it
You might also like[Bridge]
I only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion
That listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin

[Verse 2]
Back once again
Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
When I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that
Max on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends, just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me
From ugly to comfortably, suddenly
[Outro]
It all changed man, it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God, suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
P.O
One time for A$AP Yams
Let's go

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
What's this I see? Niggas tryna act like G's
Got A$AP, got Fergy with me
It's a new day, no Black Eyed Peas
That's that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, that's that shit
(You ain't got no Flacko in your Serato?)
Mothafucka better blast that shit
Niggas drink quarts of the Clicquot
Bitches sniff raw of the kilos
Flacko makes sales of the perico
She knows, went to ATL for my C-Note
'Member, I ain't ever have no home
Now I got a penthouse and a beach home
Back when I was rockin' least (2 Chainz!)
I was trappin' off at least like three phones
Me and Yams made the plan
Then I paid myself and I gave myself advance
Way before I became myself
I'd like to thank myself because I made myself the man
It's like lately I ain't myself
I'd rather hang myself before I play myself
I tell her, "throw on the dress with the pinstripes"
Know the one that fit the booty all skin tight, that's right
Yeah, you that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, move that shit
Frontin' like you did it for the fellas
Get all the bitches jealous when you do that shit
But my neck is gold, the rest is froze
Sex and hoes, best of both, girls and girls, perpetual
Sippin' slow, Texas throwed, comma, I'm about decimals
Chill and get faded, I'm surprised that we made it
Young niggas know the sky's the limit
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
Chill and get faded, shit, I'm surprised that we made it
Nowadays stress overrated
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded

Talkin' about M's
Talkin' bout M's, nigga, M's

It's like lately all I ever seem to think about is M's, nigga
Talkin' 'bout M's
See the same thing all up in my bank account
M's, nigga, talkin' 'bout M's
And my YouTube account say the same amount

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Money talk and dogs bark
I got a pocket full of stones in my stonewashed
Lambo, brand new Lambo
With tiger stripes on it call that bitch a golf cart
I'm outchea, I'm so outchea, I swear niggas have no idea
I swear niggas better wear riot gear
Cause I appear and pow loud and clear give 'em diarrhea, oh
I re-up tonight, I'ma be up tonight, cookin' a key up tonight
Niggas de-up I slide to the right, throw a three up in time
Put a B up, let's fight, don't get beat up tonight
Feet up in my European, I ride with me heater inside
Kill you and your dog then go put on a shirt that say PETA for life
Like you sneeze you on tight, you got beef I got white
You got beef I got white, I got green, I got white
I got pink, I got pints, I got lean, I got ice
I got needles and pipes, I got clean, I got right
I got mean, I got nice, that's that Tina and Ike
I don't lean on her price, I don't cheat on her price
Try to cheat on the dice, you get beat on the spot
I get keys on the spot and I keep it on lock
And I keep it up safe, what you keep in your safe?
S'what I spent on my watch and I wave it like Ma$e
Bout to redo the face, get a see-through AK
I eat seafood and steak
But girl, I'ma treat you like cake til I get a sweet tooth tooth ache
But wait let's talk about M's, not about them
I love my BM's, I love my YM ain't no more CM
Let's pluck out the stems, let's fuck like a nymph

We rowdy, rowdy, that Percy Miller
For really real, we chilly chill
Don't sport Chinchilla
My bounty hunter's
A bounty killer, I'm 'bout my skrilla
Gimme the title then gimme the cash
Fold it then bag it then move to the trap
Follow my stash, stealing my swag
Niggas is wickity-wickity-wack
Like Kriss Kross, her lip gloss
Slip-ons get slipped off
My bitch boss, Cristal
We smokin' that, thinkin' we're burnin' the hash
Puff it and pass, makin' it last
Walk in my shoes and then cross in my path
Game was for grabs, makin' 'em crash
Snuck it and snatched it, ain't givin' it back

Release Date: May 26, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/A-ap-rocky-holy-ghost-lyrics
Song Description: This song interpolates the Coen brothers movie O Brother, Where Art Thou (2000) and makes use of strong religious imagery. The Holy Ghost is a title for the third figure in the Holy Trinity described in Christianity. He is also known as the Holy Spirit. Note that the album title is a play on the word Allah, the Islamic title for God.

The central theme of the song is the corruption of institutionalized religion. Rocky refutes the necessity of such institutions, asserting that he is fine communicating with God on his own. The song has a sombre, meditative tone and closes with Rocky pleading with the Holy Ghost to help him. The rest of the album details his escapades as a famous rapper, including but not limited to problems with sex, drugs, violence, and greed  perhaps serving as a confessional for Rocky as he attempts to absolve himself of his sins.

Rocky talks about this song on his interview with Sway in the morning.
Lyrics:

[Produced by Danger Mouse, additional production by DJ Khalil]
[Intro]
Ayy, I have a message from the Most High
That says: "This negra kept his soul from the Devil."
It's true, I guess I mean, wait a minute now
Is your people really that God damn ign'ant? Really? Really?

[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
Church bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, "Quiet down"
Bow your head, the Most High's around cocktails
Guys and gals miss me, ties and gowns happen now
My entire sound is how you tryna sound? Stop it now
They ask me why I don't go to church no more
'Cause church is the new club and wine is the new bub
And lies is the new drugs, my sister the next stripper
My brother the next victim, my usher the next tricker
Satan givin' out deals, finna own these rappers
The game is full of slaves and they mostly rappers
You sold your soul first, then your homies after
Let's show these stupid field niggas they could own they masters
Holy smokes, I think my pastor was the only folk
To own the Rollie, Ghost and Rolls Royces with no Holy Ghost
And get your shit prepared, face your fears, all you niggas scared
Say your prayers, pray you fit upstairs, it's our only hope
Church bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, "Quiet down"
Bow your head, the Most High's around, Lord
(These things are not right, these things is not right) Lord
(Hell, nobody's ever defined) Lord
The pastor had a thing for designer glasses
Yeah, I'm talkin' fancy plates and diamond glasses
The ushers keep skimmin' the collection baskets
And they tryna dine us with some damn wine and crackers
Who's more important than your Lord and Savior?
Won't let the pearly gates up in this
Probably due to all your poor behavior
My mental got a couple tips to save you
Just be sure to count it as my only favor, thank me later, uh
Every night I stayed up sayin' prayer, made me greater, uh
Let's savior chasin' green for collard greens and baked potatoes
On the table, pray for cable, hit the label, now we major high
I got my own relationship with God, Lord

Lyrics:

[Intro]

Cocaine up on my gums, I think they’re going numb
I’m having stomach pains, now I’m throwing up
'Cause I’m a microphone fiend, give me the bass
Give me the beat, and let me lean, tap the vein, let it stream
Feel the pain, young Martin Luther King, with a dream
That one day that my team, we can make it with this rappin'
Now we swaggin', makin' money in Manhattan, trick, what’s happenin'?
They try to intellect with indirection just to test you
A rebel 'til my death, it’s in my flesh, it’s in my vessels
Fuck the clique you with, I’m finna fuck the bitch you next to
Fuck a metrosexual, suck a dick, I’m disrespectful
You know the kid get it, get-get sick
Spit clip, spit quick, split shit, hit kid's women
Oh, that’s your girl, huh? Well, I just hit it
It’s A$AP nigga, live with it, swag

[Chorus]

Title: Ridin’
Release Date: April 2, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/A-ap-rocky-ridin-lyrics
Song Description: Ridin', also called My Bitch, is an unreleased song that was written by A$AP Rocky and Lana Del Rey around the time they collaborated for  National Anthem.

It was recorded in 2012 and leaked online in the same year.

Rocky told Complex:


I feel like it wouldve been so good on the album, but I cant put that on. Everybody heard it. It fucked me up, cause that was a masterpiece. That song is really dope. Its just they want to be thirsty and leak the lyrics that I did when I was freestyling for a reference to take it home and actually make real lyrics. It was embarrassing, 'cause some people dont know that. They dont know the story behind it. That thats not something I would put out.

I fucks with Lana. Her music is dope. Personally, shes a really big inspiration for me. Her stuff is likeI feel like shes a female version of me. Shes eclectic, in things that she chooses, the beats she chooses. We work with the same producers for our albums, so its just kind of crazy. I mean, I worked with Skrillex and Florence and the Machine for this thing, man.

Song Description: Produced by SpaceGhostPurrp, Pretty Flacko is a single by Harlem rapper A$AP Rocky, released on New Years Day of 2012. The lyrics are focused on guns, drugs, sex, and money, common themes in Rockys music.

Long.Live.A$AP and a diss track towards SpaceGhostPurrp
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Bitch motherfuckers trying to fake it trill
Sneak diss you just to make a bill
Now the world won't take you serious
When I met you, you was painting nails
Leave a motherfucker layin' still
B— Bang him with the stainless steel
'Cause I'm making the order
Laugh at the altar, pullin' a Lord up
Don't get someone sawed up
Your brain in the sawdust, niggas is washed up
I bang out in Florida
Shoot in Miami, goons out in Georgia
Been to New Orleans
But still a New Yorker, nigga the talk of
Town, nigga, we bossed up
Bounce, but when you talk to the Lord
Of course you're forced to
Bow down like a motherfuckin' peasant
Still that pretty motherfucker
And you know Harlem's what I'm reppin', nigga

[Chorus]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my niggas

Gettin' faded, hair gettin' braided, Sophie sniffed a line of yay
Playin' spades, bumpin' Jimi Hendrix "Purple Haze"
A 40 to the face, call my homies from around the way
Give me that pussy, I'll be on my way
But grab the Jimmy so the bitch don't get no cash up out me
Pretty nigga, I'm a jiggy nigga, ask about me
Fuck niggas talkin' trash about me
But you know I tote a gauge, it can make any problem go away
Talkin' Jay, talkin' Ye, that mean you niggas talkin' cray
Razor blade across your face, I fix my face then walk away
I guess then there's nothin' more to say
Trill nigga to the death, whether Hell or the pearly gates
I think back to my early days
Whippin' and pinchin' that broad dough
It's a bit different now, switchin' and flippin' that raw flow
Substance get me higher, reefer and some fire
The devil is a liar, biased preachers shall retire
Jesus walked on water, I'm preachin' to the choir
Long live A$AP, now bow to your Messiah, bitch

Let the Lords toast with the Lords
Toast to the Lords
When come gods, come Lords

With it, get it right there in the bed
Open up your legs, let me beat that pussy red
Fuck what you said, I'ma still do me

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
All I think about is life, nights, sippin' on Sprite

Damn, how a young nigga get so nice
Young nigga cold like he sit on ice
Fuck broke, tryin' to be rich all life
I could've been a criminal and just rolled dice
My nuts hangin', my top back
Hoes screamin' that Pac back
Throwin' West side, bandana tied
A$AP life, gotta Pac tat
Harlem world my whole block strapped
Hoes all in my jock strap
My whip white but my top black
And my bitch white, but my cock black
Purple drink, got that
Tell these hoes all to twerk somethin'
Bounce on me, bitch, hurt somethin'
Tell her pop that pussy like it's worth somethin'
So shawty, she a stunna and daddy, he a runna
Be that pretty mothafucka, you could call me what you wanna
'Cause I'm in love with that ass, she in love with the cash
So she shakin' it fast and then makin' the stacks
And I'm takin' it back and I'm takin' her back
To the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kickin' her out

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, uh-uh, uh-uh
Yeah, alright, alright
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Smoking, rolling reefer up, I adjust the tweakers up
(Break it, break it down) Break it down so I can beat it up
Where the welcome back? Where the welcome mat? My sneakers tough
This is for my old head, gon' turn your speakers up
"Rocky, where you been?" I been tryna make my ends meet
So I can cop that Bathing Ape or Jeremy Scott or 10 Deep
Bottles full of Rose, riding in the Benz jeep
Blowing money fast, now I'm finna think I'm (Big Meech)
I met with my old head, we sat for a while
We rolled a couple Swishers, we chat for a while
I said, "I'm just on my grind, I come to Houston all the time"
He said, "What's been goin' down in your New York state of mind?"
Fine, you ever got days you feel like giving up
Like how you gon' eat when this gig is up?
When the chips is down and the jig is up
But I don't give a fuck, roll another Swisher up
'Cause I just came here down South so I could get these pounds out
And move my mother nice somewhere, nothin' closer than a townhouse
And my beats banging, kicking harder than a roundhouse
I spoke with my old head and this is what I found out

Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight

[Verse 2]
Now my old head old age, bald head, Rogaine
Code red codeine, nose red, cocaine
Pimpin bitches since lemon chicken, shrimp lo-mein
Gold chains, afros, platforms, Soul Train
And he told me 'bout that rapping, trapping in the old days
When Pac hung with Shock before that rat-tat-tat-tat, nose rings
And I'm so high, I could fuck around and grow wings
And we sipping on something purpler than Soul Plane
We sip slow, we slow swang
We tip fours, on chrome wings
Told me I should head home and do my own thang
Then I heard my phone rang, hold up, that's my old dame
Pick it up, I hit you back, miss me and I miss you back
She said, "Harlem miss you too and they can't wait to get you back
You should come on home, leave the drugs alone and stick to rap
Just don't come back flossin' 'cause that type of shit'll get you clapped"
[Chorus]
Life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight
'Cause life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight

Uh, uh

We use to wear rugged boots, now it's all tailored suits
Audemars Piguets for my criminal recruits
Champagne flutes, bumpin' rhythm and the blues
My partner made bad moves, he might end up in the news
Or end up in the tombs or living in the boondocks
Riding by the rules, I'll abide by it soon
See the situation we﻿ sophisticated goons
I know you live by the gun, then you die by it too
Niggas call me prophecy, swaggin' in philosophies
White on white wagon, call that motherfucker Socrates
Rat ass niggas, fighting for a block of cheese
Catch me out in China stunting, yeah, I'm about my guapanese
My shoe game serious, so serious, Wapanese
Niggas say I'm blessed, my bad I forgot to sneeze (Achoo)
There your reasons go, bitch
I got some tissues for your issues, tell 'em blow this
Bitch!

[Chorus: Santigold]
Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me, I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long

Sayin' that she chose this other guy with whom she wanna be with
Look, I apologize, but this message fucked me up
Then I would skeet-skeet every girl after replying, "Best of luck to ya"
Fast forward couple months I'm like, "Wassup witcha?"
'Cause somethin' changed I know ya feel it (Feel it)
But really it's been a lil' minute
Ain't nothin' changed but the address
My neighbors hate how I be livin' (Livin')
Mad it's a loud rich nigga in the buildin'
Like fuck all the other tenants (Runnin')
Bought mines, boy, you rentin' (Runnin')
Rich niggas in their feelings (Runnin')
Bitch niggas in their feelings (Woo)
Bags packed, knapsack packed like I'm leavin' home
They ain't wanna let me go, I guess you need me more
I was on the road on tour (Tour)
She just said I changed for the worst (She just said I changed)
Rain flags, rain backs, fact guess you need it more
Had to let your heart go, I guess you need it more

[Bridge 2: A$AP Rocky and MGMT]
I'm going through changes

Always changing phases
Upside down

Don't know if you love me or not

Or had a baby with some nigga
Or either three months, post-natal, postin' up that little nigga papi
I wonder if they really happy or just gettin' at me

Lyrics:

[Produced by Danger Mouse]

[Chorus 1: Joe Fox & A$AP Rocky]
Love on the low, love everywhere I go

My ears are ringing, my palms are shaking, my heart is racing
Somebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted
Found his body parts in awkward places
Like apartments, basements
Garbage, vacant lots, garages, spaces
Harlem's far too spacious
Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceship
To get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans
Kick off my Maison Martin's, lay on back like Martha Mason
Smoke away my iron lung 'til later die at 71, uh

[Chorus 2: Joe Fox & A$AP Rocky]
I lay down now
There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece, peace
Lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray the Lord my soul to keep

Gentrification split the nation that I once was raised in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraisin'
Back in my younger days of razor blades with gangs
Who bang and never stood a chance
Them boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking
On the pavement, and my generation fucked, and my society
Very trippy pages in my diary
It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the higher me
Used to never give a damn, now I don't give a fuck entirely
I think my pride died in me, somewhere inside of me
It's gotta be, a whole 'nother side of me
If you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of livin'
That's how many fucks I'd give (Fuck)
So

[Chorus 1: Joe Fox & A$AP Rocky]
Love on the low (Yeah, yeah, so), love everywhere I go (Yeah, uh)
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong (Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah)

Title: JD
Release Date: May 26, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/A-ap-rocky-jd-lyrics
Song Description: This song pays homage to cultural icon James Dean, who was seen as a cultural symbol of teenage rebellion and disillusionment, starring in movies such as Rebel Without a Cause. Rocky identifies with him and might want to proceed with his life on a similar road. Rocky refers to himself as the black James Dean.



The song also touches on James Deans cursed car Little Bastard, which is known to have killed and hurt many that come in contact with the remains that still existed after James' accident. Rocky adopts the very reckless behavior that Little Bastard allegedly manifested.
Lyrics:

Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace (Alright!)
Uh, Schwarzenegger I, straight slaughter niggas
I'm offin' niggas, screaming off with niggas' heads
They all surrender, better call for niggas
Come at all you niggas heads, talk 'em off a ledge
I'm arguing with 'em, I'm done talking with 'em
I order coffins for 'em, call the coroner for 'em
Get a comforter for 'em, I did all you niggas' beds
I want all you niggas dead (Yeah!)
You want oil nigga money, royalness, and bread
Royalties instead of rollies for your boys, but loyalty is dead (Grrr! Yeah!)

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Now I'm only up again
Kick... kick a man while he's down
Looks dead; can’t be safe to say it
Everybody's getting punished
Looking down to sell with you, how have you been?
Probably an undercover, had them undercovers with you
People buying and selling for you
I'll only sell with you if you're blind to sell

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah
Fake homies do turn to fake phony dudes
Let me find out that you phony too
Yeah, fake homies do turn to fake—

[Chorus]
Roll my blunt, fill my cup, be my bitch
Hold my gun, load it up, count my slugs (That's my bitch)
Yeah, they don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, be my bitch (That's my bitch)

Fuck they talk 'bout? (That's my bitch)
'Cause they don't know nothin'

[Verse 1]
Time to call it what it was, first I thought it wasn't nothin'
Probably think I wanna hit and run, bad girls wanna have fun
I don't want no Goody Two-Shoes, no nun
I ain't no priest, I ain't gon' preach
I didn't want no goodie-goodie, but she still praise Jesus
I share my clothes with my bitch like shе my sis
I don't beat my bitch, I need my bitch
She clean my crib, shе feed my friends
She keep my secret, she keep my fridge packed, my freezer lit
That's how deep I get, negative degrees
What's the type of bitch I need?

[Verse 2]
She got bank accounts too
With big amounts, shit you couldn't count
Just pick the number that you couldn't count to
Like an attitude, curve a nigga when she didn't have to
Around the lords like a British council
With all these sticks around you
We can build you a wooden castle
Got a penthouse, see the Bronx Zoo
Got a townhouse with the town view
Got surround sound with the top down
Ride through Allerton up to Soundview
I was lost then but I found you
Little slim thick with a bounce too
It's your tough love that I'm bound to
I fuck it up, then it's round two

Roll my, roll my blunt, fill my cup, be my bitch (That's my bitch)

Title: Bad Company
Release Date: March 26, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/A-ap-rocky-bad-company-lyrics
Song Description: After teasing it on Instagram, A$AP Rocky dropped BAD COMPANY as the 4th promotional single, following  5IVE $TAR$, Above, and Money Bags Freestyle, for his third studio album TESTING.

This marks the first collaboration between Rocky and Memphis rapper, BlocBoy JB, who rose to fame with his breakout hit, Look Alive featuring Drake, and the viral shoot dance popularized by Rover.

On the track, the two talk about the paranoia that comes with fame and with dealing drugs, as well as the bad company that these both bring.
Lyrics:

[Intro: A$AP Rocky & Khloe Anna]
People think you're stuck up, but we're all super good friends
It's only natural, I suppose, but we're all super good friends
Um, I get the feeling that you're admired, but, um
I'm above average

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I got so much beef, I could barely sleep
Paranoia got me losin' all my Z's, all day
Good lord, momma prayin' on her knees, all day
If you still frontin' when I up it, I'ma squeeze

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Bad company's bad for your company
Bad company's bad for your company
Mac and the ski mask in case you come for me
Got the Mac and the ski mask in case you come for me

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & BlocBoy JB]
When I say I got beef, they don't want no beef
When they say they got beef, they don't wanna eat
If he said he wants smoke, they don't want no steam
She put a V on her tee, bad bad bad bad bad
Had a bachelors degree, Ph.D. while sellin' speed
Fix the face then fix the weave, now workin' on her self-esteem
Hit up Bloc (Brrr), "yo' this Flack, nigga, where you at?
Pin the drop, uh, my new map location be the block on the app"

Y—you got bad bitches, hella hoes, i—i—it's the same here

G—g—g—gettin' money so the bottles keep on comin'
Ph—ph—pho—pho—phone ringin' so you know the trap jumpin'
Tha—tha—that nigga lookin' at me, he owe me some money
Hit 'em with the Tommy, now that nigga crumpin'
Why—why these niggas playin' games? They don't want no problems with me
My shooters got good aim, you know I brought them shottas with me
Might have hit a bad stain, they say that someone top was missin'
Them niggas were opposition
They move wrong, so I shot them bitches

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Dark shades, too much smoke, I could barely see the fumes
Actin' brand new like I don't see you when I do
Who them folks? Who want smoke? You too close, give me room
Phony folks, play it close, do the most, don't they?

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Bad company, that's bad for your company
Bad company, that's bad for your company
Mad cow disease, now you in a ton of beef
Black Mac tucked underneath my new blue dungarees
[Verse 4: A$AP Rocky]
Flintstone bust down, color Murakami
Fruity pebble bezel, Wilma, Betty, Fred, and Barney
Bad bitch from outta town, I think she model Abercrombie
Wrist game Lucky Charmy, told my jeweler Leprechaun me
I'ma come clean, I got hella beef
Paranoia got me rollin' up my sleeves, okay
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm uppin' up the fees
Whole team got V's on they tees, all day

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I got so much beef, I could barely sleep
Paranoia got me losin' all my Z's, all day
Good lord, momma prayin' on her knees, all day

Half of the other side don't live it, they push play
The young illest alive, Harlem World to the Bay
It feels good waking up to money in the bank
'Cause last year, it was shoebox and lint
I only write raps just to give you niggas hints
Every verse a gift, as you smoke like a chimney
My album coming November, that's twenty years of memory

If I don't, don't cry 'cause I ain't live that wrong
Just an artist in a purest form, I live that song
An artist in the purest form, I live that song, Bambino

Okay, hold up, ay, why fuss? I'd rather fuck

Seven deuce, waiting on the bus
Before them boys bend the corner tryna make a bust
Tryouts, I'm tryna make the bucks
Purple and the green got me on stuck
So I two-step, move my feet and keep it pushing
Always bouncin' back, gotta keep the cushion
And that's somethin' fat, like eating all the pudding
A$AP, we got a slap, bruh, good looking
Fuck that, A$AP where I come from

Weed in my pocket, coke in his tongues
Buying Swisher Sweets, no more honey buns
Fresh white tee, bright like the sun
Only nigga 'round here rocking Мишка

Lyrics:

[Intro: Max B]
—Through the spot
Everyday was like a beef to me
Lil' nigga said he'd make it hot
You don't wanna draw heat with me
I got niggas that'll run up in your spot
Cooly nigga, you don't really want beef
I'm Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep
My bitch not tryna comfort me
And, baby, I wonder, baby, I wonder

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, buccaneers of rugged gear, nigga, fuck a fair
One, since year one, I've been thuggin' here, yeah, uh
Whole shit is ours, you in awe, please don't get involved
This is war, walk around a frame with blaze up in this jawn
Behind prison walls, niggas lickin' balls, pause
Different cause, stricted laws
Damn, if I don't break up in the morgue, prison yard, prison guard
No principal, 'tention on your friends and all
Commissary missin' like your sibling's paw
Uncle Tom, please don't make my sentence long
Granted what I did was wrong
Pigs don't show remorse if you admit it all
Missin' ma', hope that she don't miss the call
Admitted that she'll never visit
Like the hard-headed never listen, Lord
So tell me how the fuck I'm 'sposed to eat? (Nigga), uh
If the richer's gettin' richer, the poor's growin' weak (Nigga), uh
My brother died up in the streets, may he rest in peace
Niggas got heat like Pusha T, get it cheap, uh
Flacko, how you been, where you at? I've been kickin' back
Relax place down my favorite thinkin' cap, scratch my nigga naps
Hitter chit and chat, this and that, A$AP diplomats
I'm missin' Max, wish that they could bring the nigga Bigga' back

And I wonder (I'm Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep), layin' in my bed (Baby, I wonder)
Am I still too young? (Baby, I wonder) Am I still too young? (My bitch not tryna comfort me)
And I hold back, thoughts runnin' through my head
Did I fuck it up? (Baby, I wonder) Did I fuck it up?
[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm twenty six but I've been livin' in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, motherfuck cops, what's the blood clots?
All I gots my word and my balls and my one cock
Pause, buckshots fly, my young buck died
Passed away from a stray, from some fake-tough-guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry
Dry your eyes older sis', held 'em close, watch 'em twitch
Gave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this
Ain't too late to pause or skip—

[Chorus: Joe Fox & Max B]
And I wonder (I'm Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep), layin' in my bed (Baby, I wonder)
Am I still too young? (Baby, I wonder) Am I still too young? (My bitch not tryna comfort me)
And I hold back, thoughts runnin' through my head
Did I fuck it up? (Baby, I wonder) Did I fuck it up?
[Bridge: Max B]
I'm Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep
Baby, I wonder, baby, I wonder

[Chorus: Joe Fox & Max B]
And I wonder, as I'm layin' in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts runnin' through my head
Did I fuck it up? (Baby, I wonder) Did I fuck it up? (Baby, I wonder)
And I wonder, as I'm layin' down in bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts runnin' through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?

[Hook]
It's so easy to fall in love

[Verse 1]
Purple kisses on your neck, thinking 'bout the day we met
Body dripping sweat, eat that, beat that pussy wet
Purple silhouettes, purple drank and cigarettes
She is my addiction, nigga need a Nicorette
Trill-ass misses, fuck her where a nigga rest
A$AP tat cause that's what a nigga rep
Style fresh to death, show you bitches how to flaunt
And the Yves St. Laurent, or her Isabel Marant
Like when Jay Z out, tryna take B out
All these magazines try to play me out
All my ex-girls tryna fade me out
By the ending I was finished, so it's crazy how

[Hook]
It's so easy to fall in love

[Verse 2]
Okay wait, now hold up, let me switch that flow up
Call her to come over and you just try to control her
Ever since I growed up, I been got my dough up
Now I'm smoking more blunts and I'm sipping 'til I'm poured up
Tore up from the floor up, tore down from my toes up
Get throwed 'til I throw up, but I'm pimping like I'm 'sposed to
Got the illest chocha, reason why I chose her
Mami is a rider and see me I be that roller
She hate a rap nigga walking with his nose up
She date a rap nigga walking with his toaster
So take your picture, get your close-up
Another fake imitation, just a poser on a poster
I did it again for my culture
Went Testarossa, traded it in for a Rover
Just to get in and get chauffeured
Driver pull over, tipping and picking these hoes up
I'm slipping from feeling this sober
Window is rolled up, this purple kissed on my shoulder
Undress and I sex and I hold her
Caressing her breast with my head on her chest I'm all on her

Song Description: On Live.Love.A$APs closing track, Rocky raps over a grimy, hype-hop beat, perfectly catching a vibe that any fan can rock with.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Olympicks—Olympicks—Olympicks—Olympicks
Uh, alright

[Verse]
Get money addict, I'ma get "Money" tatted
Money in the attics, money in the stashes
Money in the cabinets, stuffed in the mattress
Safe full of guns, more money up in that shit
Taz Arnold TI$A, Jeremy Scott Adidas
Maison Martin Margiela, three strap sneakers
Riding with a leecher, student and a teacher
It's money over bitches, no room for a skeezer
Thinking of a Lambo, Bathing Ape camo
Play with the money, turn Rocky into Rambo
Patience is a virtue, life is a handful
Friends, they'll hurt you, learned that from my grandfolks
Me under a lamp post, while I got my hands closed
Haze to my brains like eggs, got it scrambled
Yeah I feel Rihanna, and I understand Hov
What you think I rap for? To push a fucking Land Rove?
Now I'm looking back when you said I shouldn't rap
Some slept on me, other niggas took a nap
Now I'm in the basement, probably cooking crack
Gave you teaspoons full but instead you took a cap
They say Tyga and Diggy, but Rocky been jiggy
Curren$y from the Wiz ain't enough to get me home
Can't really hate when they compare me to Drake
Could have been J. Cole if I met Jay Hov
(Who dat? ASAP) But I'm fly like I never left
You's a lie, like fly without the letter F
If hip hop is dead, fuck it, let it rest
Reincarnated through me when she resurrect
Long hair, blue jeans, live on U-Stream
High top boots like Pac in a Juice scene
No, it ain't a movie, diamonds in my new gleam
Dead tone cause the redbones is my new thing
Nigga, I do things, let the coupe sing
Niggas say I'm insane, Saddam Hussein
Niggas still jokers, me, I'm on my Bruce Wayne (Uh)
Fly kicks, my shit (Uh) yeah, I'm on that Liu Kang
I ain't bragging but I do this, my shoes is Bermudas
I'm bougie in that Gucci but my nudies is my newest
And your foolishness and rumors, I give two shits
I only hear the money, so save the bullshit for the Q-tips
Swag is the coolest, my bitch is the rudest
My jeweler is Jewish and my wrist is the bluest
And I get it poppin' on the block like Whoo Kid
A$AP standing on the block like the new kids

I was in a world where everything was purple. I was just high. Purple lights was everywhere. It was just like, dark room, purple lights. Music blasting. That type of shit. Everything is purple. Swag.

Shout out to the H and that fucking SUC
My fucking brain is purple, nigga

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (ASAP, swag, swag, swag)
I said everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
It be that pretty mothafucka' sipping that throwed
Gripping my pistol, my chrome
Hidden to hit you then splitting your wig into something
I spit it and flip it like Bone
Niggas ain't ready for the flow switch
Only Harlem nigga on his Bone shit
Tippin' 4's since back in '06
Won't you see a nigga getting throat bitch?
Two middle fingers to the showbiz
Cause they selfish and they show bus'
Cause they shelf kids and it's hopeless
Career dying quicker than a goldfish

Told her to take it off, give her the D, she take the offense
Skinny nigga balling, trip but never falling
Who said to make it rain (rain)? Bitch I make it pouring
I'm a cake-o-saurus, go study my nature
Big chain on me like Treach from Naughty by Nature
Fuck what you saying, no way
A hater don't faze a gangster
Brought up in danger, all about paper
Smoking on purple, bitch, I'm dangerous, nasty crazy
90s baby, momma I made it
Up to the sky, goodbye to the pavement
Hoes get caught in amazement
I'm stuck in my ways
So fuck 'em up, I fuck 'em and duck 'em for days
What more can I say? (Yeah) I'm chasing this paper
That's purple, nigga18Embed

Lyrics:

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I thought you said you'd never leave (Leave)
I think back as I took a puff (Puff)
Know what happens every time you leave (Leave)
Always come back 'cause you wanna fuck
Always come back 'cause you wanna fuss
Holdin' back, ain't no turnin' back when you fall in love (Love)
Know what happens every time you speed (Speed)
Always fall flat 'cause you wanna rush (Rush)
Huh? So we could take it slow (Slow)
Separate the highs from the lows (Lows)
Separate the evens from the odds (Odds)
I just hope you put me back together when I come apart

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can't last forever (Can't last forever)
Can't last forever (Can't last forever)
Can't last forever (Yeah)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I woke up today high
Felt a little less pressure from you
And I'm here to say I
May have even learned a lesson from you

[Bridge: Florence Welch]
You're the eye, but I'm tearing all the time
Always there to catch me, but I'm never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know, in control
Chaos I create
I come apart

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
You made a bet with me, now you're in debt with me
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me
It's ruthless, she the closest thing next to me
The truth is that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude, but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin' 'gina, where the Wet Willies?
I come apart, I'm in her heart on her left titty
[Chorus: Florence Welch]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can't last forever (Can't last forever)
Can't last forever (Can't last forever)
Can't last forever

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
All year long bruh, stuck up in my zone all by my lonesome
Pay the hoe my dues, I brought my own funds
When it's time to war, I brought my own gun
Difference is I'm ghetto but I'm wholesome
Nigga say I switched up like I'm on some
Why you always treat me like I owe some?
Truthfully you only wanna hold some
Whip it like I've been a slave
Bucking from the twelve like I've been afraid
Motorola, burn out, couple minutes saved
Kept a pre-paid on my hip them days
143rd in front on Minisink, Cam'ron had us wearing pink
From the cradle to the grave, put in work
Hustled 'round the corner where my nana stay, couldn't work
Open up shop in front the corner store, make 'em renovate
Where the killers stand, fuck a lemonade
But they cook it by the Minute Maid, couple niggas hate
But the best form of flattery is when you imi-

Most recently, Rocky and Clams collaborated on the song Black Tux, White Collar from Rockys 2018 album TESTING.

Rocky debuted the song during the Yams Day live stream on January 18, 2021, and following the live stream Clams shared the song via his Instagram page.

On April 17, 2021, A$AP Rocky revealed that a snippet of the song would be sold as an NFT on April 21, 2021.

Leave it all in the past now, walls talkin' back now
Back to the wall, with your wall to the back
Don't back down, buck up
Tell 'em how the fuck your mama ain't raise no bitch
Gloves on the dashboard, mask on the lat' now

On the hip while the red-blue lights in the background
Cops wanna pat down, just pray the clip don't (Click, click)

[Intro]
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I'm moving... (Uh)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
War Lord, we all Lords, but we your Lords
Tryna find home, next stop is the Waldorf
Past the racism and fake-ism
Type of hate that make you feel worse than a rape victim
Raw dogs, you other niggas mad soft, mad I rap my ass off
They throwin' mad salt 'til I go bath salt
On wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off
I'm Mr. Miyagi in Issey Miyake
Asshole flow, fuck name brands, past logos
Now I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh
It's like my fashion style is the life saver
Guess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
Head is so good on that girl that I might pay her, or nah
Super laid back cat, opposite of fat black, Al Capone
Tell 'em lil' niggas Flacko home

[Chorus: Acyde]
Gotta find my way back home

Means more for my enemies
Sippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys

Make a toast for the Henny, it's the best for the remedies

Lyrics:

[Intro: Scarface]
"Mo—money and the power, money and the power"
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Dean Blunt]
Eyedrops, ("Fuckin' with the killas")
Teardrops
Droptops, ("Fuckin' with the killas")
Ice blocks (Beat drop, beat drop)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I was thinking to myself (Calldrops)
Maybe I should seek some help
Maybe I should blame myself ("Don't expect no money")
My mystique in stealth is gone away
("Don't expect no money")
It's going away, it's going away

[Chorus: Dean Blunt]
Eye drops
Teardrops
Droptops
Ice blocks

[Interlude: A$AP Rocky & Kodak Black]
You used to be so soft
This is a prepaid collect call from
("Fuckin' with the killas")
Beautiful teardrops on your cheeks
An inmate at Florida Correctional Institution
Beautiful things
This call is subject to recording and monitoring
This-this life situation and shit, you there?
Uh-huh
You ready right now?
Yeah, I'm ready, got you on speaker

All the pain I went through
Turned to a singer
I put it all on my tattoos
'Cause of where I came from
If I ain't ever learned before, then it's gon' change me
(This call is subject to recording and monitoring)
Sittin' in institution, I  done lost my baby
If nan' ain't ever woke me up, then it's gon' wake me
When them people ran up on my spot, and they took my baby
A random kind that's doing his time, but it's for no reason
A random kind that's ridin' the pine, something you free—something you free—something you free
(This call has dropped, to add more credits, please press 1)
(Free Kodak)
[Produced by A$AP Rocky, Boys Noize, and Hector Delgado]

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah this is my story, my struggle, uh
My bittersweet symphony, my pain, check it

[Verse]
Food getting lower, money coming slower
Damn land lord keep bitching cause you owe her
I'm too afraid to grow up, I pray to God I blow up
And roll up in something foreign where the front doors go up
I wonder if my peers could hear my prayers
The only nigga got me scared is the man upstairs
When my back against the wall, I'mma face my fears
I'll swallow my pride 'fore I swallow a tear
Cause I be going hard, Stevie on his job
I'm praying until something happen, I'm answering to God
These wolves got me scarred
I try so hard to survive, guess just to prosper gotta strive
Then I hit the stage, all gone and blazed
Everybody know my name and the song I sing
I rejoice my pain and they doing the same
And the haters gonna hate, I'm just doing my thing
Got my bad bitch with me she so dangy
Said she love ASAP cause we so tangy
Living life fast so I feel like kids
And I'm blowing up quick so I feel like B.I.G
With the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
Now we doing deals with the major businesses
Get a little change, niggas feel a little strange
Uh-oh truck flow, pull off in a range
Niggas say I changed but I'm living it up
Shit if money didn't change you, you ain't getting enough
Fuck coppin a car, I'm tryna fly to the stars
Smooth on the moon and I be mobbing to mars
Niggas say I'm ill, y'all ain't telling me shit
Cuz the nights we was ill, y'all ain't help me with shit
Ooh now my money change drastic, The coupe do gymnastic
The doors lift up and the roof do a back flip
Zooming through traffic, probably with a bad bitch
Slash actress soon we on our way to Saks Fifth
Life was so tragic, all of that was past tense
Now I'm living lavish, this got to be magic

Title: Brotha Man
Release Date: May 25, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/A-ap-rocky-brotha-man-lyrics
Song Description: Brotha man is a term used for people who you consider good friends. By defenition in the Oxford Dictionary, It is also used by black men to address people, mainly other black men.

This therefore plays very well with songs chorus, as it is asking for brothers alike to stick together and stand for something.

For the 9th track on TESTING, Rocky recruits Snoop Dogg, Frank Ocean and French Montana. The song consists of each artist bragging about their wealth and how far they have made it. They dont need anyones help anymore. Snoop Dogg is an exception, he appears during Rockys verse for about 4 seconds.

This song marks the first of the Frank Oceans two collaborations on TESTING, the second being the outro Purity.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Young man, brotha brotha, you gotta fight for somethin'
Stand for somethin', gotta understand, gotta make the plays
Stick to it, get through, write yours, ride your wave, just keep it true
We'll fight the blues, we'll fight the blues
Brotha man, young man, let me tell you somethin'
Young man, brotha man, brotha man
You gotta fight for somethin', stand for somethin'
That's what the poem told me
It was a greater poet like you know it but
I'd rather talk about how my neck is frozen and I
I'd write a song about the banging hoes and then
Stay up in the bitches while she dozing

[Chorus: French Montana]
When I went to my brotha, told him, "Help me please"
Now we hop out the PJs posted by the P
My old bitch yellin', "Come back, come back
Come back, babe
Come back (Come back) come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back) babe"

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky & Snoop Dogg]
Harlem nights, quick speed, Godspeed
Speed of light, Grease Lightnin', leather on my six-speed bike
Bicycle tires, icicle diamonds, popsicle stripes
Pop (Sicles) pop (Sicles) for the Klondikes
Pop-pop wheelies on the dirty bikes, 15 sellin' China white
Cops stoppin' if you opposite of white
Pop, pop like you opposite of right
Take heed, lil' nigga, lowkey, take lead on them niggas

Walkin' in my shoes, follow me like suit

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Brotha man, young man, let me tell you somethin'
Young man, brotha-brotha, gotta fight for somethin'

Song Description: OG Beeper sees A$AP Rocky talking about his life growing up and what he always wanted to become since he was young; a rapper, obviously. Even though he sold drugs and modeled before, becoming a rapper was always his goal.

This song marks the second collaboration between BlocBoy JB and Rocky, the first being Bad Company.
Lyrics:

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, posted on the corner like a trapper, uh
Why he move his hands all around like a rapper? uh
Why he move his pants up and down like a scrapper? uh
(Testing, testing, uh-huh, listen)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
My whole life I just wanted to be a rapper
Then I grewed up and the boy became a rapper
And my older sister made me wear the golden wrapper
She said, "Watch out, 'cause you know the hoes will trap ya"

[Break: A$AP Rocky & BlocBoy JB]
To the block—to—to—to the block
To the block, ayy, ayy, ayy
Don't know why

Word, word, word, word, word, word

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & BlocBoy JB]
Got my first pager, that was 1998
Sneaking, talking to my girlfriend way up late (Hello)
Mama on the mothafuckin' line, "Boy, you cray"
I was trappin' since a young nigga by the way
Back, way back then, boy, I was a different dude (Dude)
Standing on the corner like I ain't got shit to do (Do)
Nowadays (uh-huh) feelin' like I ain't got shit to prove (To prove)
All the beef is lookin' minuscule (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I modeled Dior, but I'm still a rapper (Yeah)
Took a little detour, but I'm still a rapper (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Used to be a D-boy but I'm still a rapper
My whole life I was livin' like a trapper (Trapper)
Shacked next to Casanova, locked up on the island
I don't brag about it 'cause it never really matter
Knew that I would never go back, don't hold back
Just shine my golden teeth
Just throw my dubs sack, that boof pack
That specimen, I could beef with OG beepers, nigga

But cozy beeper all I needed (Hello) OG beeper all I needed (Hello)

[Outro: A$AP Rocky & BlocBoy JB]
My whole life I just wanted to be that nigga (Nigga)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]

Song Description: The Japanese text on this song cover art roughly translates to

At the top  Asap Rocky Presents

Above the Y  Around the World

In red font  Dont be Dumb  coming soon this fall!

Text at bottom 1980A$AP  

In the dark alleys of 1980s New York City, a killer named A$AP Rocky spreads terror. Dressed in black, he roamed the streets at night, hunting down his prey in the shadows of skyscrapers. His name was whispered throughout the city like an urban legend, and even the mightiest of men trembled with fear. No one could predict where it would strike next, and the city was enveloped in fear.
Lyrics:

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Uh
Know what I'm sayin'?
Pretty nigga shit, jiggy nigga shit, nigga (Uh)
Fly nigga shit, nigga, since day one nigga shit, type shit, nigga (Yeah)
Trill, real nigga shit, in the field nigga shit (Uh)
I ain't playin' with these niggas no more
I ain't playin' with these bitches no more
No, from now on, it's rose gold and rubies and pearls everything
Everything, fuck is you talkin' 'bout, man? (Uh)
Like, I don't know if niggas just didn't catch the fucking trajectory (Uh-huh)
Yeah

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Ruby stones on my rosary, champagne rose in pink (Ha, ha)
Ring around this rosie, niggas singin' like they Rosalía (Ha, huh?)
All black stones, Black-owned, like I'm Jodeci (Yeah)
Funny how I birthed so many sons with no ovaries (Yeah)
Still fuck 12, fuck jake, 5-0
Oh, still fuck 12, fuck jake, 5-0
Ruby stones on my rosary, champagne gold, rose in pink
Ring around the rosie, singin' like they Rosalía
All black stones, Black-owned, bitch, I'm Jodeci (Yeah)
I done kept my foot on niggas' necks way before police
And it's still fuck 12, 5-0, four, and three too
One time, comin' up the street, here they come (Woo)
And I got a laundry list of bitches I can't wait to see
And I got a laundry list of niggas I can't wait to see
Ruby stones on me like a rosary
Champagne gold, rose in pink, ring around the rosie
Ten-man army, scared niggas tryna crow with me
Nigga want smoke with me, tell him, "Push up, Hercules"
Hercules, tell him push up, tell him pull up, thirty-three

Illest nigga alive

Took it in stride in conditions where I shouldn't survive
Now I ride windows down, with my foot on the side
Barely could drive, all the doors suicide
Like, who dared me to die? (Uh)
You a dead man walkin' like you barely alive
Cut everything but the family ties (That's right)
Cut the shit, cut the lies, word to the wise
Who in your top five? (Fuck your top five)
I don't get fresh to death, bitch, I'm buried alive
I heard dog talkin' funny like it's Family Guy
Carin' for niggas like I'm Mary or Bob
Made a promise to God
You gotta strive when you marry the mob
They ain't seen this drip since Rick The Ruler
They done forced my hand, my shit is Rugers
We don't wear Zara, shit don't suit us
Every time they throw stones, I take 'em to my jeweler
Ruby red rosary, skin lookin' coffee bean
Berries on the coca leaf, smokin' on the potpourri
Navy Bentley moccasins, never too close in reach (Reach)
Back home from overseas (Uh), jade stones, clover leaf
Emeralds like Dorothy, yellow bricks on the feet (Uh, uh)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Hello, the world is tumblin' down
I been chasin' my piece of the pussy, I just got the cookie, it's crumblin' now
I'm startin' to think that judgment day they talkin' 'bout's comin' around
Show money they throw up is startin' to slow up, I bet that they humblin' now
I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin' how a nigga gon' stretch these millions
What happens when rappin' no longer matters? Can I still make a stack on my brilliance?
I don't wanna go back to civilian status
I'm an addict for comfort and doin' whatever I want to
Whenever I wanna, I promise myself I would never feel hunger again
So I'm here with this pen, lockin' the fuck back in
I'm from a rough past, for a quick dollar they poppin' your hubcap rims, profit is just that slim
I was a rugrat when we had it the toughest and I had a hunch back then
That I was special, I gotta move careful, 'cause niggas 'round here they don't wrestle
No reason to tussle, reach down with a pistol, was down, so put one in your freckles
He was talkin' that shit, then he saw a lil' stick, all of the sudden he feelin' forgetful
Connectin' to God, I'm a vessel
When they ask for the old you, ignore 'em
Goin' backwards is borin', bitch, and I'm not Michael Jordan, I don't do the retro
Uh, ayy, tell 'em again like an echo
My niggas ain't Greek, they pledgin' the streets, they come through and kick in your backdoor
Used to cut through this bitch with my hat low
Now I ride through this bitch in the Batmobile
See somethin' that's ill, come flow through the 'Ville
Ain't too hard to tell who behind the wheel
[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
You rent somewhere, but I can live somewhere
At least somewhere that's not like that there
You rent somewhere, but I can live somewhere
At least somewhere and that's not like that there

Song Description: This song was thought to be the song previewed first at rolling loud 2022 as this turned out to be false. It was then later previewed at the listening party for DONT BE DUMB on July 25th, 2024 and then released as a single on August 2nd, 2024.
This song is also a light jab at drake, as the main rhyme scheme is like that and the first line in his verse also suggests that
Lyrics:

[Intro: Creed B Good]

Bitches hit my phone talkin' shit, I don't like that
Niggas talk about me, where they at? It's just like that
Bitches hit my phone talkin' shit, I don't like that
Niggas talk a—

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & Creed B Good]
Fuck your ho 'cause she like that
Yeah, bitch, fat ass, pretty, I might wife that
Niggas swear they pimpin', Scottie sippin', get your wife back
Ho, you know you trippin', Flacko different, know you like that
Swipe a pretty bitch right off her feet, this a hijack
Why your nigga flexin' like he me? Ain't even like that
Bitch mistake my newest pinky ring for a ice pack
Shorty keep on damn requestin' me about some Snapchat
I don't even like rats, invested into mice traps
Pull up to the trenches, all my jewelry, yeah, I'm like that
I just put my finger in the **** 'cause she like that
Don't compare that pussy boy to me (I don't like that)
Feelin' like I'm Sosa, Chiefie Keef (I don't like that)
Tired of them niggas sleepin' on me, I don't like naps
Niggas fuck around and stole the flow and y'all like that?
Okay, okay, and I'm right back
A$AP right up on my gut and that's a life tat'
Walk inside the booth, I just talk, I don't write raps
Walk into the store, I bought the floor 'cause I'm like that
Tell her, "Give me that, give me those," fuck a price tag
Yeah, I hung around way uptown, where it ain't nice at
Catch me on the block, not the web, this ain't Minecraft
Before we dropped "Peso" on you niggas, you ain't like Raf
Niggas want a feature from me? This ain't a life raft
Talk to God before I go to sleep, He hit me right back
He said, "Stay calm, put your trust in me, you on the right path"
These niggas want my wife bad, the people want my next track
The coppers want my Black ass, fucked up, but it's like that

Title: West Side Highway
Release Date: May 26, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/A-ap-rocky-west-side-highway-lyrics
Song Description: Track 13 off Rockys album At.Long.Last.A$AP sees him dealing with the glamorous side of his self-made fame, and the way in which it impacts upon his relations with women. Shouting out a number of expensive brands positions him as someone with taste and style, but he juxtaposes this with a disregard for the feelings of the women he is with, miring him in the stereotypes that follow the life of a successful rap star.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Yeah, these days of preference has no complexion
You could be light, dark, mixed or fair skin
Just light the candle
Cold sweats down the handle, life's a gamble
And she know
Love with me is like a c-note, outside of Reno
A couple white lines
A cup of white wine of Pinot, Italian Grigio
House keys to P.O
Ride from overseas but that's basic
Wasted, high on the West Side Highway
Drunk enough to fuck with, face it

[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
Hangovers, leftovers in the Range Rover
Shame on her, make up or get a makeover
Think over, Glenfiddich start to takeover
When I brainstorm, all the hoes ain't got a thing on her
Audemars, season order like summer fall
I throw the Audemars, then I throw out all the ball
New Dior from the boutique store
Only thing in common that we got is that we want it all
Little cutie pie, saw her looking super fly
More Justin Timberlake on my suit and tie
Try to scrutinize, 'cause I keep two inside
Suicides? No sir, hoes get the Uber ride
Or we can kiss 'til the sun come up
Or, sit on my lap 'til somethin' come up
She ain't really wanna club, I don't really wanna judge
Girl, just wanna have fun 'til the fun run up

She know, went to ATL for my C-Note (Uh)
'Member, I ain't ever have no home (Yeah)
Now I got a penthouse and a beach home (Woo)
Back when I was rockin' least (2 Chainz!)
I was trappin' off at least like three phones (Uh)
Me and Yams made the plan
Then I paid myself and I gave myself advance
Way before I became myself
I'd like to thank myself because I made myself the man
It's like lately I ain't myself
I'd rather hang myself before I play myself
I tell her, "Throw on the dress with the pinstripes" (Uh)
Know the one that fit the booty all skin tight, that's right (Uh)
Yeah, you that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, move that shit (Woo)
Frontin' like you did it for the fellas
Get all the bitches jealous when you do that shit
But my neck is gold, the rest is froze
Sex and hoes, best of both
Girls and girls, perpetual, sippin' slow, Texas throwed
Comma, I'm about decimals
Chill and get faded
I'm surprised that we made it
Young niggas know the sky's the limit
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
Chill and get faded
Shit, I'm surprised that we made it

Song Description: Acid Drip discusses three of hip hops biggest cliches: weed, sex and lean. Rocky details his party lifestyle, evidently crazy.

Lyrics:

[Verse]
Feeling outta place, plus it's getting kinda late
Tryna make it home safe and not get raped, where you live?
Tina tummy ache, Gina got the funny face
Mona's sniffing dope, so her dome is leaning on your rib
I bet you wish you had a Benz cause you just helped your friends
Flag a taxi, now you walking not too far from your crib
Craving for an acid tablet for your satisfaction
Said you feeling flabbergasted, you just had to have it
Made your way to 7th Ave, flagged a yellow cab
Now you need an upper fast to help your mellow swag
Black kid, french braids and he keep the potent
Hold ya purse, don't trust him cause his teeth is golden
Dice rolling, reefer blowing in the streets, he smoking
Blowing weed while police patrolling, uh
Acid strips, purple drank, you can have a sip
Have a fix of this acid drip, drip

[Chorus]
Hands on her thighs, kiss on her lips
Eye for an eye, drip for a drip
I get ya high, please don't forget
I can supply the fix for ya trip
Hands on her thighs, kiss on her lips
Eye for an eye, drip for a drip
I get ya high, please don't forget
I can supply the fix for ya trip

[Intro: ASAP Rocky]
Yo, ASAP here

And a pinky ring, bling, bling
And all my niggas here, they about to kill this shit

Sipping Hen, staring at that white girl from Michigan
She was with a friend, fat ass fly ho
I went in for the kill, ASAP, pronto
So wait boo, 'fore we hit your condo
Got another friend with me named Whitney from Chicago
Whitney love ta model? I'm thinkin' ménage
The truck parked out from, the Chevy get Ta-hoes
Haters all in my face, can't see, blindfold
? on my feet, blew right by folks
Stuntin' on sucker niggas is what I was designed for
Dead fresh, fresh to death, I should have designed clothes
But I'm blessing these tracks, sick flow, swine flu
Y'all ain't fucking with Nast, I been nice, y'all knew
Haha, nigga that shit times two
I'm who your bitches wanna kick it with, kung-fu
But what, dog? What is you saying?
Nast in this bitch, ho, why is you playing?
Like I won't slay this stage on some gang shit?
Turn into a mayhem, beat hard, flow hurtin
Cali swag bitch, snapback, no jerkin'
Fuck work, fuck money in hands, hoes know this
Fast forward, past focus, I'm that on it
One of the best to do, I think not, you bet on it
Giant ass you be lumberjack Paul Bunyon
Hoes love it, lover never put none above it
Wanna hug me tighter than jeans ass sportin'
Carry corpses to cemeteries, that's very often

Raider Klan, all back and we aiming at your throat

[Verse 3: ASAP Rocky]
I wanna rock but the bitches want me, though
D&G briefs fit a nigga like a Speedo
Skinny nudie jeans, though
Boots be 40 below
He flow, 100 degrees, the jewels zero
Rockstar rap, he reps Guitar Hero
Leopard Louboutins like Speedo on Steve-O
Charge me on the game, couldn't pause me on Tivo
Beyonce, the Kanye, I got a big ego
On to that next shit, you looking at the bestest
Married to the game, treat you niggas like my stepkids
Pull up in a Porsche, niggas get nausea
Didn't write the rules but my status like the author
Just crashed the range, so I pulled the Bent out
Probably getting brains, chilling in the penthouse
Swagging on you maggot and I'm about to lay my pimp down
Christian Louboutin red bottoms come in mens now
On to the next ones, skinny jeans fit in
Pull up to the shows and these hoes know to get in
Said they like my fitted clothes down to my split ends
Little do she know, I got a big ego
Automatic weapon need an order of protection
Killin Feelin all these records so my charges is molesting
An assault with deadly weapons, got these rappers feeling threatened
A hip-hop veteran, I'm a hip-hop felon
[Verse 4: ASAP Twelvy]
It's a war going on outside and we started it
Believe that or die, nigga, on some martyr shit
All my niggas on the scene like some Sparta shit
And we came to double up on that Harlem shit
We all eating, this is how it's supposed to go
Stop speaking, this is how you supposed to flow
The ins and out, never a winner's route
I never lose again, it's like every day I lose a friend
To some dumb shit, whore and dumb bitch
So a hating nigga, whore cuff wrists
I know a lot of niggas sitting in a cell now
For the shit I've done, I'm probably even hell-bound
But it's cool with me, jacking niggas' jewelry
I don't give a fuck about your foolery
Nigga keep a tool with me just to blast at you bitches
Marvelous at the top and our rags to the riches
ASAP, nigga

[Verse 5: ASAP Ferg]
On my Pokemon shit, you already know...
I said, I said, I said
I swear to God I want it all
He gon' give it to me back
And get on top above it all
Purple label sweats, I swear to god I'm rich
And once I get these many bitches, swear to God I'm in

Henny, and I'm out here and my dad was in bed
So I down a whole bottle on that bitch with the mink

I'm sorry, Mama Ferg, for all of these curse words
But I'm so fucking serious

And I'm tweaked, like a nerve
And I'm smart, like a nerd
Guess that's why my last name Ferg
Okay I'm glidin' like a fucking bird
Yeah my name is Ferg but I'm a fucking turd, ya heard?
Now I'm on some rider shit
You done got yourself in beef

Now you want to know the deadline on some Project shit
Black bitch an actor, put em in some Tyler shit
Pu-ray you buried then hair dyed like that Robyn bitch
This ain't no bullshit, I ain't letting no fools in
See my bitch ride that big thing, you on that little shit
Trying to make noise, you squeaking like a little pig
Put her into that dog, my attitude's a little Vick
[Verse 6: ASAP Rocky]
Next time my niggas fall back
ASAP Raider Klan and we all blacked out
Tell that bitch get it mapped out
And I fucked a bitch, now she flat out
Chest out, on the fucking floor, never hit it raw
Got a condom and I got a towel by the door
Just in case the smoke go into the hallways
Cause I be smoking weed and fucking all day
This is off the top of the dome, let me introduce my niggas before a nigga go home
We got Ty Beats, the illest producer in the streets
You know he come through with that motherfucking heat
Got Twelvy, motherfucking Twelvy, got a bad bitch, Jewish named Shelby
Got my nigga Nast in the back
Got a snapback to the back, he don't even know how to act
Got my nigga named Purrp, Spaceghostpurrp, do your bitch real dirt

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
'Bout twelve bad hoes in my section like Vegas
A few of 'em strangers, a few of 'em famous
When that ain't enough and black ain't enough
Man, I'm done actin' up, let's hit the crib and get faded
When you don't drink champagne but you orderin' cases
All your friends hangin' 'cause they know that you payin'
When them bills backin' up and black ain't enough
And them checks addin' up, you just don't wanna be famous

[Verse 1]
Got a mink doormat that say, "Nigga, we made it"
Got all white neighbors and most of 'em racist
They put your name and faces when you goin' in places
Then black ain't enough, you just don't wanna be famous
Real talk, real rap, look, I can't deny shit
Couldn't afford shit, but always was attracted to fly shit
Guess that's why I buy, won't invest or capitalize
But expectin' to die rich, just a rich nigga mindset
That's why I'm packin' up my shit, like I'm back at the mom's crib
Like I'm back on my grind like, it's a nine-to-five shift
'Cause nothin' was handed to me, uh, go in and hand it to me
Like I'm Puffy in '96, (Gimme the loot, gimme the loot)
Let's hope that she really for me, most hoes couldn't handle me
I'm postponin' a family, work hard so they know what I stand for
Just have 'em to Grammy me? Damn, have 'em Grammy me?
Damn, just don't wanna be famous

Your friends like hangin' 'cause they know that you payin'
When them bills backin' up and black ain't enough
And them checks addin' up, you just don't wanna be famous

[Verse 2]
Uh, look at me, get what you see, envision me
Braids and chains, is he Pusha T or Mr. T?
No Hookah smoke, no niggas please, no liquor please
A different me, I'm in this bitch and I'm sippin' tea
Uh, but never spill the tea, most of you niggas sick of me
What would she do to get to me? Get off the tip of the dick of me, please
Another victory, be flawless like the skin on me, please
Don't compare him and me, you offendin' me
This ain't a diss and we ain't enemies
They concerned with breakin' hits, I'm more concerned with makin' history
Loudest nigga in the room the weakest
Them quiet dudes just probably need better speakers
This ain't a modest way of livin', I ain't hungry
Just did a demolition to my kitchen, it was ugly
Cash rules everything around me, get the money, funny
How they got 20/20 vision but don't see a nigga vision 'til 2020?
(Wow) Uh
[Chorus]
'Bout twelve bad hoes in my section like Vegas

Bad Spanish bitch, one kiss'll take your breath away
I could bag your girl in a broken down Chevrolet
Swag do the talkin', I ain't even gotta decorate
I was 21 when I bought my mom a condo
A guitar and a gift card down at Costco's
It's a cold winter when it's blowing past my goggles
Penthouse, top floor, window with the gargoyle
Performance down at Santos, Phantom suicide doors
Paparazzi slide-shows, showers with the slide doors
One night, five shows, two-seater, five hoes
Eyes closed, I can see them hating through the blindfolds
Niggas better switch it if the business ain't the convo
I'm all about my chicken nigga you could call me Roscoe's
If I wasn't spitting I'd be probably flipping waffles
I suppose God knows I coulda been a snot-nose

Fuck different girls, 'cause when they see ya boy

Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me

[Verse 1]
Now you can cry me a river or cry me a ocean
Maybe the Pacific, that's just to be specific
I gotta keep it pimping these hoes they say I'm tripping
I don't care about your nails and your new hair, do your lipstick

Coco Loso with my flash, no flashin' photos
Fashion photos in your mag'
That MAC gon' pogo stick
Them plaques gon' fall, no go, go
Go-Go Gadget, polo jacket
Matchin', poke out, ratchet
Matchin' with new SR, no-no logo
Trucker hat from AWGE, you bastards
That's Chanel, my bag Chanel, my bitch Chanel
My bag Chanel, her rag Chanel, we match, Chanel
When I was younger, man, I wished that I was light-skinned
Now I wouldn't trade the world for my skin
I surpassed what you could do inside your life span
So just give me a little credit like a white man
That's good credit, hood credit, fuck credibility
Flacko loko, need my strength and meet my .44
Please, capeesh, my beats on hold (Hold)
Don't hold me up, she on her knees, the low blow (Low blow)
I just need my doja, dojo, master, Master P, my teeth please
I'm sixteen, golden teeth clean
Come fuck me in my teepee (Uh)

Smoke (Ty Beats)
What it do, baby?
It's Paul Wall, come on

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Purple pint, that's Gucci rap
Driving slow, black on black
Backwood lit, windows cracked
Dime in my lap with her hair pulled back
And a hand full of diamonds all on my wrist
Mouth full of ice, pardon my lisp
World full of haters, very few rich
So I open my mind and stack up my chips
Lollipop grind, whole lotta licks
From paper planes to a house made of bricks
Big ol' cold cup with codeine mix
So I'm so throwed and I'm still gettin' lit
And everything is purple, baby

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I said everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
I said everything is purple (Swag)

Trill OG and I rep the South
Man, I rep the streets and I rep the hood
And I'm grippin' grain, grippin' stains
And I'm flippin' mane, so it's to the good
I'm holdin' wood with diamonds on it
Hittin' the block and I'm grindin' on it
With a big ol' chain and a big ol' piece
'Cause when I'm in these streets I be shinin', homie
Haters better get they ass behind me, homie
'Cause I'm in the front and I'm takin' charge
And when I'm done, I have 'em on the run
And they be hard to find like they's El Debarge
And my swag is large, extra large
I can barely fit it up in this room
But don't sweat the size and don't be surprised
When your bitch surmise that I'm the shit then swoon
I lick the blunt and I pass the 'dro
Spit my game and I smash your ho
But no, I ain't trick, it's no passin' dough
Then I hop up in this slab and I mash it, bro
I got a passion for this Southern flow
It's that purple life and we thuggin', bro
These haters might not really understand it
But that's all good 'cause we love it, though
This P-A-T, that's where I'm from
That's what I rep and that's how it go
I roll with rocks so get up off the jock
From New York to PA, this that purple flow
It's that swag

I said everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
I said everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Purple swag, purple swag, I'm in the zone, I'm getting throwed
That purple swag, purple swag, that purple smoke up in my clothes
That big booty, juicy fruity, yellow bone, I wanna bone
I'm getting dome, I took her out, dick in her mouth, she getting on
I'm flexing steel, I'm flexing still, I'm sitting high, I'm tipping slow
I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow
I got these boppas going crazy, they see me comin'
Robitussin, quit discussin', A$AP, tell these niggas somethin'

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Killa Kyleon]

Chest rocky like a nigga named A$AP
Fast money man, I get mine ASAP
Always stacking and I'm paid, that's ASAP
Wood grippin', candy drippin'
Four in my twenty, I'm candy sippin'
Fill my prescription, I'm leanin', ho
Nightmare cup, I'm dreamin', ho

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Back through the door, bag full of smoke
Sit back, relax and max with the hoes
Chat with my folks, laughin' at jokes
I’m hard to the core and she bad to the bone
Ask her to bone, chats on the phone
Her three friends with her just'a tagging along
As for the flow, back to the song
Flashbacks only bring me back to that thong
Cause we been getting, we’ve been getting high all week
Smoking, drinking, I’m her drug and she get high off me
Now I’m back to the store
Blunt wrapped, full of 'dro
Roll it back in that Backwood
Pass it and smoke
Want to get her high so I pass her the most
She want that bread and butter so I pass her the toast
That A$AP motto is "party, get high"
We back to the future
That Marty McFly

So how my presence always last

"There go my niggas" dap to my dawgs
I prey on that pussy, chat with the Lord
Seem how it seems like I had it before
I think back, way back ran with my memories
We was getting high, sippin' on Hennessy
Now it's like lean
Thinkin' back seat
Way back riding on something clean, knamean
Twenty-tens
We don't do the teens now it's twenty-eleven
Let me know something take her back to my session
Back to the pad, now I’m back on that ass
Back to the future, back to the past
