Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast it scares me
Mind games, don't leave me
I've come so far, don't lose me
It matters where you are

[Chorus]
As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With her cool things and her heaven
Hey hey, lover, you still burn me
You're a song, yeah (Hey hey!)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Listen close and don't be stoned
I'll be here in the morning
'Cause I'm just floating
Your cigarette still burns
Your messed-up world will thrill me

[Refrain]
Alison, I'm lost

[Chorus]
"Alison," I said, "We're sinking"
There's nothing here but that's okay
Outside your room, your sister's spinning
But she lies, tells me she's just fine
I guess she's out there somewhere

[Verse 2]
And the sailors, they strike poses
TV covered walls
End so slowly
With your talking and your pills
Your messed-up life still thrills me

Title: Dagger
Release Date: May 17, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Slowdive-dagger-lyrics
Song Description: The final song on Souvlaki, Dagger was written during a retreat to a Welsh cottage by Neil Halstead in the summer of 1992. It is about a fucked up relationship, likely the one Neil and Rachel shared during the early days of the band.

The song has an acoustic sound, which is pretty unique in Slowdives discography, but similar to the dream-folk style of Mojave 3, the band formed by Neil Halstead, Rachel Goswell, and Ian McCutcheon after Slowdives disbandment.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
The sunshine girl is sleeping
She falls and dreams alone
And me, I am her dagger
Too numb to feel her pain

[Chorus]
The world is full of noise, yeah
I hear it all the time
And me, I am your dagger
You know I am your wound
I thought I heard you whisper
It happens all the time
I thought I heard you whisper
It happens all the time

[Verse 2]
She whispers while I'm sleeping:
"I love you when you smile"
I didn't really lose you
I just lost it for a while

[Chorus]
The world is full of noise, yeah
I hear it all the time
You know I am your dagger
You know I am your wound

Title: 40 Days
Release Date: May 17, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Slowdive-40-days-lyrics
Song Description: 40 Days was written and recorded in the after math of Neil Halsteads breakup with Rachel Goswell. Seeking seclusion, he left on a 2 week trip to a Welsh cottage, where he recorded this song.

It hadnt been long since i and Rachel split up, so i was kinda miserable about that, and i was miserable to be in this little cottage in the middle of nowhere. "It was about being miserable. A lot of Slowdives stuff was about atmospheres, and so possibly in a sort of slightly teenagy way it was about creating cinematic moments. So i guess lyrics would try to look into it. Its like when you watch a film it could remind you of really sweet moments and you kinda look into that as a feeling, and i think sometimes that sort of stuff carry over into songs.

 Neil, in Pitchforks Classic Slowdive episode

The drums are very loose, it kinda bounced a bit more, it skipped and then its kind of a new thing to the Slowdives sound. It gave Neil, Rachel, and Christian more freedom to sort of play with a sound in a new way.

 Simon Scott, Slowdive drummer

We were looking for a more sparkly and in some ways poppier feel to certain aspects of it, we didn`t want to make an entire pop record, but we wanted to have more light and shade, and more sort of feel to it.

 Christian Savill, Slowdive guitarist
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Forty days and I miss you
I'm so high that I've lost my mind
It's the summer I'm thinking of
Forty days and I'm blown away

[Chorus]
If I saw something good
I guess I wouldn't worry
If I saw something good
I guess I wouldn't care

[Verse 2]
You said you're always sleeping
But it's all I believe in
It's just that I'm always falling
And it makes me feel bad, yeah

Title: Machine Gun
Release Date: May 17, 1993, URL: https://genius.com/Slowdive-machine-gun-lyrics
Song Description: Machine Gun is one of the most ethereally dreamy shoegaze tracks on Souvlaki.

The capital of Sheba was the city of Ma'rib. Nearby was a great dam, which provided enough water to make Sheba an agricultural nation, as well as a land of beautiful gardens. It was a fertile oasis in the desert. There is evidence that this dam burst, and the devastation caused by the ensuing flood, coupled with the loss of water for agriculture, may have led to the demise of several Sabaean cities which no longer exist today.
Lyrics:

[Verse: Rachel Goswell]
See you walking and I know she's my friend again
Just the weight of the water drags me down again
Guess I'll think of the water, it's my friend, oh yeah
It's just the way that the water makes me feel again

[Chorus: Neil Halstead]
Son of Sheba, I saw him drown
Son of yellow, I saw him down
It's all I need, yeah

He declined, however, he agreed to do a couple of days of recording with Halstead, and out of these sessions came the tracks Sing and Here She Comes.

Title: ​​the slab
Release Date: August 9, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Slowdive-the-slab-lyrics
Song Description: Album closer, the slab is a muffled, fuzzy collection of guitar and haunting, repetitive vocals. Incomprehensible lyrics akin to Heaven or Las Vegas remind the listener of the influences and history of Slowdive.

In a press release, Neil Halstead said the track is

the heaviest on the record and as the name suggests we wanted it to feel like a big slab of music. We wanted it to feel very dense.

Title: Blue Skied an’ Clear
Release Date: February 6, 1995, URL: https://genius.com/Slowdive-blue-skied-an-clear-lyrics
Song Description: Blue Skied an' Clear can be seen as Slowdives most noticeable attempt to mimic the atmosphere of the final two Talk Talk records, 1988s Spirit of Eden and 1991s Laughing Stock. Both records, alongside Slints 1991 album Spiderland, can be considered the first formative records in the post-rock genre.

Talk Talk were a massive influence on Pygmalion. Its all about the way they used the space and how it slides into abstraction at points. It was really unusual, how they did that. Theyre organic records  Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock. I got Laughing Stock first, but of the two records, Spirit of Eden is my favourite. Its just so beautiful. They recorded bits of it in the dark. Sometimes theyd turn the playback off, so whoever was playing would be playing along and theyd pull the tracks out of their headphones. Its almost like free jazz at certain moments. But I love how it descends into something slightly abstract and then slides back into something more formal. I dont know of many records that do that in quite the same way. Youre moving into Coltrane, Miles Davis territory, but Talk Talk do it in a song-based structure. Its really clever. Sonically, its one of those geeky records  a proper headphones album.  Neil Halstead via The Quietus, 2017

Title: Avalyn I
Release Date: November 5, 1990, URL: https://genius.com/Slowdive-avalyn-i-lyrics
Song Description: Avalyn I is the second track off of the bands 1990 self-titled debut EP, Slowdive. It is also released as the second track on Slowdives first compliation album, Blue Day.

A light guitar starts off the song, as if one had just fallen asleep. The song picks up to the second when they just entered a dream full of overwhelming emotions, with drums beating to the speed of a heart, and eventually, the dreamer realizes that they are in a dream.

Despite acknowledging theyre in a dream, the dreamer is not in control and is left alone to a dream of flashing emotions, with no one to be there.
Lyrics:

Lyrics:

I cross the field and watch the sun go down
A million people clap, it makes me frown

Looking 'round, I see you slip away
You seem more beautiful than yesterday

The devil takes my mind, but I don't care
He gives me all his love, he gives me air

Don't pay it any mind
I'm losing all the time

Lyrics:

The most beautiful day I ever saw
With these eyes I saw the best in life
The most sensical day I had
Turning stones, turning stones over til they shone

(Dark as days, dark as days)

And you were caught in the dark
With nothing makes sense
But you were caught in the dark
Where nothing makes no sense

(Shadows down, shadows down / when I saw the light in you)

The most beautiful day I ever, ever had
With these eyes I saw the light in yours

Its likely the lyrics are about a father or a mother whos happy and hopeful because their daughter found the love of her life.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Behold through your dreams
What you did without me
Cause' he's right there as you see
He knows where you go
He sees through your mind
I cry deep inside, I'm lost
It's the only way to live for you

[Interlude]
What you did without me
It seams that you are not there

[Verse 2]
You know you must stay
To places I know
I call, I cry, and you know
It's the only way to love for youSee Slowdive LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also likeEmbed

Lyrics:

Jennifer
Where do you go at night?
Is no-one there
To hold you tight?

Above your head
I see a golden bar
And it catches me
From around you

Jennifer says she'll be back when she's older
She's fixing her wings just to fly
Leaves me alone from her beautiful paper
Fixing her wings just to fly

Closer still
I hear a melody
Singing loud and clear
Above the trees
Like a siren's call
Away on a distant ball
Like a memory
That breaks you in two

Jennifer says she'll be back when she's older
She's fixing her wings just to fly
Leaves me alone on a beautiful paper
She's fixing her wings just to flySee Slowdive LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also like1Embed

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Michelle, light upon you hold me
I lie all for the sun
I'll be your light for you thought say (?)
Michelle, I want to know more

[Chorus]
Michelle, like I can
Throws your light not right
I wanna the sun
It gets so wrong
Miss you more I can
Shadows on the sun (?)

[Verse 2]
Michelle, I can see what you want to be
The sky is all I know
Throw out your light and I’ll be gone again
Throw out all that I've seen

[Chorus]
Michelle, like I can
Seeing all but I can
I wanna the sun
Did you climb over
Miss you more I can
Shadows on the sun
Feel like you
Michelle, I can see
Through your lies
Michelle, I won't shine
It’s all on meSee Slowdive LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also likeEmbed

Lyrics:

[Verse]
Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast it scares me
Mind games, don't leave me
I've come so far, don't lose me
It matters where you are

[Chorus]
As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With her cool things and her heaven
Hey hey, lover, you still burn me
You're a song, yeah (Hey hey!)

[Verse]
Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast it scares me
Mind games, don't lose me
Come so far, don't lose me

[Chorus]
As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With her cool things and her heaven
Hey hey, lover, you still burn me
You're a sun, yeah (Hey hey hey!)

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

Watching all those things, and he's passing all this time
Looks just like the man, but he fails to walk in line
Grow into the future boy- hoping for a ride
Grow into the future boy- boy just wants to fly

It's not for you that I say such stupid things
It's for the times I wept- the times I was alone
It's not for me that I say such stupid things
It's for the times I wept- the times I was alone

Passing 'round the whisky boy- looking for some style
He's taking all the future, and he puts it in a bag
Now I don't believe in you- takes it all away
I hope to God I leave you with your sanity, and style

It's not for you that I say such stupid things
It's for the times I wept- the times I was alone
It's not for me that I say such stupid things
It's for the times I wept- the times I was alone

It's not for me that I say such stupid things
It's for the times I wept- the times I was alone
It's not for you that I say such stupid things
It's for the times I wept- the times I was alone
Was aloneSee Slowdive LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also likeEmbed
