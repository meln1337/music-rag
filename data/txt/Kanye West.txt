Artist: Kanye West, Alternate Names: Ye, Kanye, Kanye Omari West, Yeezus, Yezos, Mr. West, Yeezy, Louis Vuitton Don, Yandhi, Martin Louis The King Jr., Christian Billionaire Ye, Kanye O. West
Artist Description: The ubiquitous Kanye West—from his famous quip, “George Bush doesn’t care about black people,” to interrupting Taylor Swift’s speech, to marrying Kim Kardashian (and later divorcing her), to announcing that he’s running for President, to admitting his love for President Trump, to proclaiming that there were admirable things about Hitler—it’s obvious that he’s a staple of the tabloids and the entertainment world, industry-wide.

That certainly doesn’t take anything away from his music; as a matter of fact, it only seems to add to his fortuitous career. For instance, his 2010 album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, was universally praised by fans and critics alike; it was recorded smack dab in the middle of the backlash received from his Swift interruption and his break-up with then-girlfriend Amber Rose.

He has scored countless well-known hits, as well, from each of his previous studio albums—such as “Stronger,” “Heartless,” and “Gold Digger.” Each of his albums have been massive critical and commercial successes, including his collaboration album with JAY-Z, Watch the Throne. As of 2022, West has won an astounding 24 GRAMMYs, as the most decorated hip-hop artist in Grammy history, he splits this title with his big brother JAY-Z, who has won 24 GRAMMYs too. And yet he doesn’t have seem to take too much pride in this fact.

Kanye’s sixth solo album, Yeezus, polarized his fan base and the general public but was heaped with rave reviews by music critics for its experimental production. In 2016, West released his seventh and most delayed body of work, The Life of Pablo, which was illegally downloaded over 500,000 times, frustrating fans after its TIDAL-exclusive release. West notably updated the album multiple times on TIDAL after its release.

Quite possibly West’s most surprising contribution to the music industry was his production streak during the summer of 2018, in which he produced five albums. Among these was a collaborative project with Kid Cudi, titled KIDS SEE GHOSTS; along with his eighth studio album, ye, which tied Eminem and The Beatles for eight consecutive chart-topping releases.

The public’s love for Kanye West has been apparent from the get-go, and each of his solo albums, barring his 2004 debut, The College Dropout, has peaked at #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Chart. Another major standout, 2008’s 808s & Heartbreak, is largely credited with influencing the next generation of rappers; from the emphasis on heavy beats and melodic instrumentals to its heavy usage of auto-tune.

His ninth studio album, Yandhi, was originally scheduled to be released on September 29, 2018, and then again on November 26, 2018. However, West rescheduled the album release, because he felt it wasn’t finished yet, and eventually seemed to completely scrap and recycle its components into a new album. Songs from Yandhi have been reused in later Kanye albums such as Donda and Jesus is King as well as Travis Scott’s Utopia.

On August 29, 2019, Kim Kardashian-West teased a new Kanye album tracklist via Twitter, with the title Jesus is King.  Kanye seemed to confirm this by clearing his official website and posting the same image of the tracklist with the expected drop date at the bottom, September 27, 2019; almost a year after Yandhi was supposed to be released. However, the release was delayed to October 25, 2019, to release along with his accompanying documentary.

Furthermore, after years of claiming he would run for President, he finally announced so on Twitter which was met with much controversy, many claiming it was merely a publicity stunt for his forthcoming album, Donda.

On August 24, 2021, West applied to have his name changed from Kanye Omari West to Ye, he cited “personal reasons” for the change, and on October 18, 2021, the request was granted. West had been alluding to this wish to change his name since 2018, and had used Ye as a nickname for several years prior. In a June 2018 interview, he explained:

I believe ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Bible it means you. So, I’m you. I’m us. It’s us. It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye. Just being a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused – everything. It’s more of a reflection of who we are [as] beings.

Following the overwhelming release of Donda, the album was further introduced to a sequel, which was further campaigned publicly on January 27, 2022. The album was met with an unfamiliar approach — only being supported on his Stem Player device — after his departure from Def Jam. It was debuted at a concert, which showcased the incomplete album, and then left as it was.

Title: Mercy
Release Date: April 3, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-mercy-lyrics
Song Description: Matthew 5:7, which states Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy, contrasts starkly with the songs portrayal of Mercy as a symbol of materialism and excess. This ironic use of Mercy, typically associated with compassion and forgiveness, highlights a stark divergence from its traditional moral and spiritual implications, especially in the context of the songs themes of wealth and power.

Originally titled Lamborghini, Murci, this cut is the first single from Cruel Summer.

The beat was originally produced by Lifted (signed to G.O.O.D. Music). Kanye added the intro vocals, which sample Super Beagles 1996 dancehall track Dust a Soundboy. The intro and refrain vocals on Beagles track are by Fuzzy Jones whos known for his singular dubplate intros.

The track has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA, selling over four million copies, and peaked at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Title: Monster
Release Date: August 27, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-monster-lyrics
Song Description: One of the most highlighted posse cuts of 2010, Kanye, Rick Ross, JAY-Z, and Nicki Minaj boast on how theyre a Monster on the mic. Fittingly, the song comes with a couple of horror movie references.

In a September 2010 MTV News interview, Rick Ross explained the origin behind the song:

I was actually in the studio with Kanye in Hawaii when he played the concept for me. I was blown away. I had the opportunity to sit in the studio while Nicki wrote her verse just off the record.

The song was originally released as a G.O.O.D. Friday track on August 27, 2010 before Ye replaced it with the Runaway Love (Remix) with himself, Justin Bieber and Raekwon. He, then, re-released Monster on October 23, 2010 as the third single from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and it peaked at #18 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

The songs official music video, directed by Jake Nava, features dark, horror related imagery, with references with several horror movies, such as American Psycho and Saw. It became widely controversial on release, with medias labeling it as graphic, racist and sexist. As a result, it was banned on MTV and removed from Kanyes YouTube account.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life? (Ah)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really, really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really, I don't give an F-U-C-K
"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake"
"She on a diet," but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster!
[Outro: Justin Vernon & Charlie Wilson]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (No)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Head home)

And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

Title: Ultralight Beam
Release Date: February 14, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-ultralight-beam-lyrics
Song Description: Ultralight Beam is about Kanyes faith in God.  This track establishes strong parallels for The Life of Pablo with the life of Saint Paul the Apostle. Paul (Saul at the time) was blinded by a light beam from Heaven as he was journeying to Damascus to persecute Christians. He remained sightless for three days before regaining his sight and dedicating his life to serving the Lord. He has been credited with writing 13 of the 27 books of the New Testament and is considered one of the most influential figures in the early church. His writings dictated much of Christian theology and doctrine post-Resurrection.

The track features pentecostal-type chants and prayers, as well as heavy Gospel influences, including a prominent feature by preacher and Gospel artist Pastor Kirk Franklin. Kanye proclaimed this album as a Gospel album a month before its release:

https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/692435575836676097

Pastor Kirk Franklin described Kanye as his brother and preached that although Kanye has made mistakes, everyone is equal in the eyes of God. This is similar to the teachings of Paul.

An extended version of the prayer in the outro was released on March 27th, 2016 titled Ultralight Prayer.

Kanyes use of a church choir is reminiscent of earlier songs such as The College Dropouts Two Words and Never Let Me Down.

Lights are a recurring motif in Kanyes songs, both in titles and running throughout the lyrics. The ways that light can expose, reveal, blind, disorient, focus attention (or detract from something else) is most obvious in All of the Lights but can be found in every album.

This song was nominated for Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 2017 Grammys.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Samoria Green & Natalie Green]

We don't want no devils in the house, God (Yes, Lord)
We want the lord (Yes, Jesus)
And that's it (Yes, God)
Hallej— hand over Satan (Yes, Jesus)
Jesus praise the Lord (Yes, God)
Hallelujah, God (Yes, God)
We don't want no devils in the house, God (Yes, Lord)
We want the lord (Yes, Jesus)
And that's it (Yes, God)
Hallej— hand over Satan (Yes, Jesus)
Jesus praise the Lord (Yes, God)

So why send oppression, not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd You do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes You feel so strong (Safe)
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light (War)
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that You'll make everything alright
And I know that You'll take good care of Your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light
[Bridge: Chance the Rapper]
When they come for You, I will shield Your name
I will field their questions, I will feel Your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted, Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean, I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made “Sunday Candy,” I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, "Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'"
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th
[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, Kanye West]
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything

[Post-Chorus: The-Dream, The-Dream & Choir, Natalie Greene]
(Yes, God)
(Hallelujah)
I'm tryna keep my faith
(Yes, Jesus)
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
[Outro: Kirk Franklin & Choir]
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war368Embed

Title: Bound 2
Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-bound-2-lyrics
Song Description: As opposed to the industrial, electronic influences found throughout Yeezus, this warm soulful track sees Kanye Bound 2 his partner, Kim Kardashian.  Reminiscent of Wests earlier work, the soul instrumental and background vocals are sampled from the Ponderosa Twins Plus Ones 1971 song Bound, whereas the memorable uh-huh, honey comes from the intro to Brenda Lees 1959 record Sweet Nothins.

Kanye first shared a short snippet of this song on his website together with the album cover casing for Yeezus. Along with New Slaves and Black Skinhead, Bound 2 was one of three singles to be previewed before the albums release. However, it was one of the last tracks to be finishedthree weeks before the albums last possible delivery date, Kanye enlisted Rick Rubin to help finish the song. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Rubin recalled:

The whole song was written without that main sample; it was a last-minute thing. The song had kind of a lot of R&B music in it. [] So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking out as much stuff as we could, and then in the chorus reducing what was this whole musical thing, just this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. I was thinking like Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe.

Bound 2 peaked at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100. The original, pre-Rick Rubin version of Bound, titled Bound 1, was premiered by producer Hudson Mohawke at a concert in 2014.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21, but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walk-around-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane around, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept
[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Brenda Lee]

Title: Runaway
Release Date: October 4, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-runaway-lyrics
Song Description: The piano, the echoing voice in the background, the distortion on his singing, the vocoder solo: every single element of this track is spine-tingling, hauntingly beautiful. Combine that with Pushas verse and it becomes Greek tragedy rap: it takes the clichd ideas of power, sex, money and removes all the glamour from them.

West has stated that the song serves as a toast to the douchebags. West weaves a tale through topics such as his relationship with Amber Rose, his arrogance, insecurity, and sorrow.

Pusha-T spoke about his emotional state during the writing process for Runaway:

I wrote Runaway four timesand what he does not know to this day is that I was going through a relationship scandal in my life. So this man is asking me to write a song about a relationship and to say that Im the biggest douchebag ever. Hes telling me, Yo, you need to be more douchebag. We need more douchebag! I didnt want to say to him, Dog, I dont know if I even have douchebag in me right now. Ive been jammed up, and its hard for me to even tap into that part because Im remorseful. [Laughs.]

Producer Pete Rock added:

[Kanye] played Runaway'and as soon as I heard the drums come in, I just started laughing. He used my drums from Mecca and the Soul Brother! I used these drums in an interlude before this record called The Basement, and those drums come on before the song. I never heard anybody make a song the way he made it out of those drums. I thought that was genius.

Kanye premiered Runaway at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awardsone year after his infamous I'ma let you finish interruption of Taylor Swifts speech at the VMAs.

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Twenty-four seven, three sixty-five, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, alright, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs?
Haha, knock it off, Neimans, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you knew of that advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day, you just up and leave
[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know

Run away fast as you can

Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you would've thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that, "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that, "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

[Refrain: Kanye West]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers

Title: Blood On the Leaves
Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-blood-on-the-leaves-lyrics
Song Description: Blood on the Leaves utilizes a sample of Nina Simones Strange Fruit to tell a tale of lost love.

Production was handled by six producers, one of whom was Hudson Mohawke of TNGHT. In a Pitchfork interview, he discussed the creation of the song.

I think Kanye had wanted to use that Strange Fruit sample for a while, but it was like, How in the hell are you going to get that to fit? But it miraculously came together. Obviously, Strange Fruit carries so much political weight, and Blood on the Leaves is more about past relationships, but you can draw some parallels between the two. Theres not an overtly political message in the final lyrics, but in some ways that wouldve been too easy.
Lyrics:

[Produced by TNGHT, Kanye West, Mike Dean, Arca, Carlos "6 July" Broady, and 88 Keys]
[Intro: Nina Simone]
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

[Verse 1]
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah, I told you to wait
So I'ma need a little more time now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me (Black bodies)
All want something out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it

And you were screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'

[Chorus 2]
You could've been somebody
We could've, ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly

All that cocaine on the table, you can't snort that

All in on that alimony, uh

Title: Black Skinhead
Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-black-skinhead-lyrics
Song Description: Making its debut on Saturday Night Live, Black Skinhead (stylized as BLKKK SKKKNHEAD in reference to the Ku Klux Klan) is a dark, rebellious and near-tribal record that threads between both Kanye Wests traditional braggadocio and anti-establishment, anti-racism themes.

Skinhead refers to the cultural movement, which originated in the 60s in Britain. In the post-war economic boom, with more disposable income available to them, much of the youth became embroiled in fashion trends, music and consumerism. The song is most likely referencing the racist neo-nazi side of the group that grew to represent almost the entire movement in the mid-80s to the 90s.
Lyrics:

[Produced By Daft Punk & Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
For my theme song (Black)
My leather black jeans on (Black)
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on (Black)
Enter the kingdom (Black)
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in (Black)
Came to see me in my black skin (Black)
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' (Black)
If I don't get ran out by Catholics (Black)
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq, bitch

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up 'cause this shit 'bout to go (Down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (Now)
But there's nowhere to go (Now)
And there's no way to slow (Down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Verse 2]
Stop all that coon shit (Black)
Early morning cartoon shit (Black)
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb, bitch (Black)
Black out the room, bitch (Black)
Stop all that coon shit (Black)
These niggas ain't doin' shit (Black)
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on, homie, what happened?
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action-action
[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans

Title: No More Parties in LA
Release Date: January 18, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-no-more-parties-in-la-lyrics
Song Description: This song is the first collaboration between Kanye West & Kendrick Lamar. The L.A. based artists swap stories on No More Parties in LA, playfully venting their frustrations with rich people problems and highlighting Hollywoods greatest production: the fake celebrity lifestyle. Kanyes verse has drawn parallels to his sophomore album, Late Registration.

No More Parties In LA has its origins in the My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy sessions, where Madlib left five beats with Kanye, including this one:

I just paint the scene of how I felt sitting there with Madlib working on these tracks and just hearing the textures.

After the pair joined forces for Kanyes Yeezus Tour and Kendrick appeared in the writing credits on Kanyes 2015 hit, All Day, rumors and speculation began to swirl about a possible collaboration. The songs snippet was originally released as the B-side to Real Friends.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Johnny "Guitar" Watson & Junie Morrison]
La-di-da-da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)
La-da-da-da-di-da-da-a, la-a (La-a, la-a, la-a)
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod—)
Please (Shake that body, party that bod—)
Please (Shake that body, party that body)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Um—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl in North Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said, "Baby, spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards"
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, "K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy"

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I 'member Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It just mean, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)
Big, big money (Money, money, money)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker
[Bridge: Larry Graham]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla—, pla—, pla—
[Chorus: Kanye West, Junie Morrison & Ghostface Killah]
Please, no more parties in L.A. (Shake that body, party that body)
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh (Shake that body, party that body)
No more parties in L.A. (Los Angeles)
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
[Outro: Junie Morrison]
Let me tell you, I'm out here from a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far
Swish

Title: Famous
Release Date: February 14, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-famous-lyrics
Song Description: Famous explores what it means to be famousRihanna personifies fame on the hook.

Kanye premiered the music video for Famous on June 24th, 2016, at The Forum in Los Angeles. The video features nude images of famous celebrities, including Taylor Swift, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Amber Rose, Ray J, Caitlyn Jenner, Bill Cosby, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Anna Wintour, George Bush, and Donald Trump.

The video was inspired by Vincent Desiderios Sleep" (pictured below) and Leonardo da Vincis Last Supper. Like Da Vincis painting featuring Jesus and his disciples, Kanye makes use of 12 people, albeit in a different setting.



Kanye conducted an exclusive interview with Vanity Fair 48 hours before the video premiered. Vanity Fair wrote:


We were very careful with shots that had [something] sexual to take them out, he said. What we see instead is a moody, quasi-religious tableau of naked, vulnerable, strangely peaceful bodies at rest. Under the sheets, West seems to be saying, celebrities are just like us.

Its too early to say what the reaction to Famous will be, but West has already won over one constituency. He has previewed the film for a few celebrity pals who dont appear in it. Guess what the response is when I show it to them? he said. They want to be in the bed.


Famous samples Nina Simones Do What You Gotta Do, marking the fifth time Kanye has sampled her, behind Yeezus Blood on the Leaves, Watch The Thrones New Day, 808s & Heartbreaks Bad News, and Talib Kwelis Get By. The song also samples Sister Nancys Bam Bam and the organs during Kanyes verses sample a 1973 Italian progressive rock song Mi Sono Svegliato E Ho Chiuso Gli Occhi by Il Rovescio Della Medaglia.

Chance the Rapper revealed in an interview with Beats 1 Radio that he originally had a verse on the track, but it was removed when the album was mastered.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Rihanna & Kanye West]

For all my Southside niggas that know me best

For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets, give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)
They mad they still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (Goddamn)
Yeah, we still hood famous

Title: Ghost Town
Release Date: June 1, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-ghost-town-lyrics
Song Description: Ghost Town is perhaps the standout track on yeat any rate, its the albums sonic climax. Assisted by PARTYNEXTDOOR and long-time collaborator Kid Cudi, Kanye places Jersey newcomer 070 Shake center stage. The record culminates in her triumphant and memorable two-minute-long outro which captures Kanyes feeling of liberation:

And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free

The song is somewhere between high up and down low: Cudis mournful vocals express the feeling of being unloved and rejected, then Shake deliriously chants about feeling free, almost invincible. Painting a picture of deep depression and manic euphoria side by side, Ghost Town essentially is the musical epitome of Kanyes bipolar disorder, which is one of the central themes of the album.

Kanye also once again demonstrates his knack for making good use of relatively odd samples. The short track Someday by Shirley Ann Lee serves as the intro before Royal Jesterss Take Me For a Little While from 1965 builds drums and guitar and serves as the lyrical template for Cudis chorus.

Interestingly, Shake revealed that they finished the song on the day of the albums release, which was also the day of Kanyes listening party. Some earlier version of the song was apparently destined to feature on Kanye and Cudis collaborative album KIDS SEE GHOSTS, as the title Ghost Town appeared on an early tracklist. Eventually, KSG came with a sequel to Ghost Town called Freeee.

Ghost Town was voted best song of 2018 by the Genius Community!
Lyrics:

[Intro: Shirley Ann Lee]
Someday, someday
Someday, I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Someday, someday, someday
I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Someday, somedays, I remembered this on a Sunday
Backway, yeah, way, way, burning, mhm-mhm
Uh, someday, I'm gonna tell everybody
Somedays, I wanna hit the red dot on everybody
Someday, ohh (Heatstroke)
Everyday I'm livin' high, I'm smokin' marijuana
Everyday I'm livin' high, I do whatever I wanna, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Someday, we gon' set it off
Someday, we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Someday, the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes, I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what they had in mind
But maybe someday

Woah, once again, I am a child
I let it all go of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free

Title: POWER
Release Date: May 28, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-power-lyrics
Song Description: Produced by Kanye and S1, POWER samples 21st Century Schizoid Man by progressive British rock band King Crimson, the drums from the Cold Grits' rendition of Its Your Thing (not the first time), and Afroamerica by Continent Number 6.

During an interview with New York radio station Power 105.1, West said he spent thousands of hours working on this carefully-crafted song. A song like Power took 5,000 hours, like literally 5,000 man-hours to do this one record. Thats the amount of time I was putting into every song on the album, West revealed.

The accompanying music video has received critical acclaim. Russian supermodel Irina Shayk, who sits in a chair in the video, has called it a moving painting.

George Condo designed the cover art for the single. Condo also designed all five artworks for the album. The rolling head had been Wests Twitter profile picture since its release until 2018.
Lyrics:

[Produced by Andrew Dawson, Jeff Bhasker, Kanye West, Mike Dean & S1]

[Intro: Kanye West]
I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-century schizoid man)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doing? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'

[Outro: Kanye West & Dwele]
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Mmm, now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window, letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

Title: All Mine
Release Date: June 1, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-all-mine-lyrics
Song Description: Opening with church-like organ music, All Mine ironically deals with infidelity.

To let the genie out of the bottle means to allow something to happen that cannot then be stopped  like controlling ones desires while in a committed relationship. Ye goes on to list several high profile celebrities who have been caught out cheating and speculates about their motives.

While this track was ultimately called All Mine, Ye Tweeted after the release of the song that it was initially going to be called Medulla Oblongata  the component of the brain partially responsible for regulating respiration and circulation. Reference to this can still be found in the lyrics.
Lyrics:

Sometimes, you gotta bag the boss up
I call that takin' Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy a sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle
Almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe

Ayy, time is extremely valuable
And I prefer to waste it on girls that's basic

Title: Gold Digger
Release Date: July 5, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-gold-digger-lyrics
Song Description: Kanye examines the gold digger phenomenon and sheds light on relationships on this hit single. The songs hook was originally written for Shawnna and performed from a females perspective with lines like

Im not sayin' Im a gold digger, but I aint messin' with no broke niggas.

Kanye had previously performed the second verse at a Slam Poetry event.

The beat was produced by Kanye with Jon Brion. Gold Digger contains a bouncy beat formed from handclaps and scratches by DJ A-Trak and an interpolation during the introduction of I Got a Woman by Ray Charles, who featured artist Jamie Foxx played in the 2004 biopic Ray and later won the Academy Award for Best Actor for it. Now thats synergy!
Lyrics:

[Intro: Jamie Foxx and Kanye West]

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, "I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm"
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard, she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher

His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his

Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' 'round lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, "We want prenup! We want prenup!" (Yeah!)

Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week, he moppin' floors, next week, it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

Title: Wolves
Release Date: February 14, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-wolves-lyrics
Song Description: Wolves explores a gamut of emotions, including fear, hope, and love. Kanye makes reference to his mother, Donda West, as well as comparing himself and Kim to Mary and Joseph.

An earlier version of this track was first released at the YEEZY SEASON 1 launch event on February 12, 2015, featuring Vic Mensa and Sia.

A year (minus a day) later, another version was released with new verses from Kanye and an outro by Frank Ocean, but without Vic and Sias contributions. This version was included on the initial version of Kanyes seventh album, The Life of Pablo.

After Pablos release on February 14, 2016, Kanye revealed that he still planned to go back and fix this track. On March 15, Kanye updated Wolves, re-adding Vic and Sias parts and moving Oceans outro to its own track.

In an interview with the Breakfast Club, Kanye expresses how Wolves originated:

https://youtu.be/ixLOt-MeDyU?t=2415

The video for the song was released on 29th July as part of a Balmain advert campaign. It resonates with the emotional feel of the song as it features Kanye and Kim in tears.

Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club

Title: I Love Kanye
Release Date: March 29, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-i-love-kanye-lyrics
Song Description: I Love Kanye was added to the tracklist of The Life of Pablo after his live performance in Madison Square Garden on February 11th, 2016. The song is a satirical take on the Kanye Loves Kanye meme, using this space to talk about himself from the third person.

By reciting many of the same criticisms that others have of him, he says them in a way that makes them sound ridiculous and petty. Many of Yes followers resent his new artistic path of bad moods, angry outbursts, and narcissism and wish he would return to the wisdom he promoted on The College Dropout.

Prior to TLOP releasing, I Love Kanye was featured in a Saturday Night Live skit that revolved around SNLs Kyle Mooney challenging Ye to a freestyle battle.

On March 30th, 2016 Kanye tweeted the lyrics to this song in a bunch of tweets.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
I miss the old Kanye, straight from the Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye"? Man, that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves KanyeYou might also like81Embed

Title: Real Friends
Release Date: January 8, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-real-friends-lyrics
Song Description: Real Friends is an introspective look at Kanyes relationship struggles with his friends and family. As a father, husband and artist, his hectic lifestyle has caught up to him and he blames himself for his not keeping up with his friends and family. Ty Dolla $igns' lyrics come from the perspective of Kanyes former friends.

Real Friends marked the relaunch of Wests 2010 G.O.O.D. Fridays series. Kim Kardashian West tweeted the highly anticipated series was starting up again and would kick off with this track.

The song was accompanied with a snippet of No More Parties in L.A. which features Kendrick Lamar. The full version was released the following week.

The cover art shows a young Kanye producing, playing keys of a midi keyboard. The style is reminiscent to the cover art of Only One.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn, I forgot to call her, shit, I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry? Uh

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young, I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time

Ain't finna talk to you, ain't finna get with you
Don't get me mad 'cause I don't wanna injure you
She put my paintings inside of her living room
Look at the problems and issues I'm livin' through
They tryna drown me, I rise to my pinnacle
Walked through the block like the neighborhood general
Drop me the lo' and then that's where I send it to
I was forgettin' you, now I remember, now I remember
Did what I want and I say what I want
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?
I got this God power, that's my leverages
I got this Holy Water, that's my beverages
I gotta help myself out of selfishness
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges
I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell 'em "sorry," they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't deliverin' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God every day, that's my bestie
They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me soon as she met me
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
We had to stop countin', it's gettin' too petty
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me
Nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me
[Chorus: Kanye West]
We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid
For when my kid, kid, kids have kids
Everything we did for the crib

[Outro: Kanye West]
Pray for what folks and them did
Only thing we pray God forgive-give-give
May God forbid-bid-bid
He hit one of the kids, kids, kids
Took off His list, list, list
Look what they did, did, did
Pray for the crib, crib, crib

Title: Can’t Tell Me Nothing
Release Date: May 15, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-cant-tell-me-nothing-lyrics
Song Description: A single off Kanyes 3rd album, Graduation, Cant Tell Me Nothing is considered a bit of a sleeper hit, as the single Stronger was much more popular, especially at the time.

Kanyes agonizing lyrics pair perfectly with the slowed down soul beat as he shouts out his haters and critics.

Kanye himself has noted that this is one of his favorite songs on his own discography.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Kanye West & Jeezy]
La, la, la-la (Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to Heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

[Chorus: Kanye West & Jeezy]
La, la, la-la (Ayy!)
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la-la (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (Yeah! Haha!)
You can't tell me nothing (Yeah! Yeah!)
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (Yeah!)

But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, "Back in my day"
But homie, this is my day
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then
Aight, man, holla, then

[Chorus: Kanye West & Jeezy]
La, la, la-la
Wait 'til I get my money right

Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a–uh–depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
With way less effort
'Cause when you try hard, that's when you die hard
Your homies looking like, "Why, God?"
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Chorus: Kanye West & Jeezy]
La, la, la-la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la-la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
[Outro: Kanye West & Jeezy]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
(I'm serious, nigga, I got money)

Title: Devil In a New Dress
Release Date: November 22, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-devil-in-a-new-dress-lyrics
Song Description: Produced by Bink!, Devil In a New Dress finds Kanye using familiar religious imagery in contemplating all kinds of nasty thoughts about his girl.

Its perhaps an ode to Amber Rose, Kanyes (now ex-) girlfriend and muse, whose figure could have only been forged in the Depths of Hell by The Evil One (in a good way)

Devil in a New Dress was initially released as a solo version on September 3, 2010, and was the fourth release in Kanyes weekly GOOD Friday series. The title, of course, is a pun on the famous Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels song Devil with a Blue Dress On, as well as being a reference to the 1990 Walter Mosley book Devil in a Blue Dress, which was adapted into a 1995 film starring Denzel Washington and Don Cheadle.

Fresh off of the success of his Teflon Don album, Miami rapper Rick Ro$$ spits what is often regarded as one of the finest verses of his career, but it was not the first verse he wrote for the track:

When I recorded that verse for the first time, [Kanye] came in, heard it, he told me he thought I could do better. And he walked out. And then I wrote another one, and the second verse I wrote is the one you hear on the album.

Bink! said the following about the production of the track:

Kanye sent me out to Hawaii to work with him and I was actually just holding my laptop and it [the beat] came on in my iTunes. He heard it through my laptop speakers and he was immediately intrigued; I wasnt even gonna play it for him. He overheard it and asked, Whats that? Its another joint I got and he was like, Bounce that down let me hit that. So he hopped right in the booth and the first thing he said was I love it though and the first line he came up with was, She love Jesus but she learned a lot from Satan. They didnt call it Devil In A New Dress'at the time they called it something else. It was called 'Magic Hour. So when Devil In A New Dress came out, I didnt know anything about that.

Bink! sampled Smokey Robinsons Will You Love Me Tomorrow? and patched together the section at the 3:52 mark with the section at the 2:07 mark to create one seamless track:

I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but you done learned a lot from Satan, haha
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make-up, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, "This what you really wanted, huh?"
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime

When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Ma$e screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase, so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat, haha
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme," not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation, haha
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (Uh)

Song Description: Initially titled Closest Thing To Einstein, the final track Saint Pablo addresses Kanyes deepest thoughts and insecurities, namely the $53 million dollars of debt he mentioned before the release of The Life Of Pablo, Twitter controversies, and media speculation over his mental health.

https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/702564590392057856

The song premiered on February 23, 2016 during Yo Gottis The Art of Hustle listening party at L.A.s 1OAK a week after the release of The Life Of Pablo.

https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/702566224304152576

Producer MIKE DEAN confirmed that he produced the track along with Kanye on the KanyeToThe.com forum. Hip-hop fans will recognize the distinctive metallic clang sound sampled from Jay Zs 1997 Where Im From.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah-yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My wife said I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate, we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, "How my neck look?"
Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (Real!)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego when confidence was my last resort
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow
[Bridge: Sampha]
Nightlife, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)

[Verse 3: Sampha]
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you
Oh, the invisible truth stay sober
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me
And looked at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above
[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)

Title: Gorgeous
Release Date: November 22, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-gorgeous-lyrics
Song Description: Gorgeous sees Kanye describing the ugly nature of social injustice in America, ironically calling the nation gorgeous because of it.

Recorded during his self-imposed exile in Hawaii, West formed the track with elements from The Turtles 1968 single, You Showed Me. The lush and electric guitar riff present throughout the song stems from Enoch Light and the Glittering Guitars 1969 cover of the same Turtles' song.

West reclusively worked with artists he was familiar with during his time in Hawaii, leading to Kid Cudi singing the chorus. In an interview with MTV, Cudi revealed that he had to lie in order to get on the song:

Gorgeous was one of those records that, as soon as I heard the beat, I was like, Man, this is the one. [] I came up to him, and I was like, Man, are you working on this record? Are you working on this beat? He goes, Yeah, do you got an idea for it? I was like, Yeah, I might. I didnt. I was lying like a motherfucker

Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon initially had no interest to feature on the track. He was later convinced by RZA, who assisted on Dark Fantasy" and So Appalled, to work with Kanye. Regarding the collaboration, Raekwon said:

The first thing I can tell you about Kanye West is that hes a hard worker. When you look at him, you can tell that he still has that whole hip-hop thing in his bones.
Lyrics:

[Produced by Kanye West, Mike Dean & No I.D.]
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?
You might also like[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off of this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Ayy, yo
I done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Not for nothing, I've forseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down247Embed

Title: All of the Lights
Release Date: November 22, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-all-of-the-lights-lyrics
Song Description: All of the Lights is the 4th single from Kanye Wests 5th studio album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.

The song is about Kanyes qualms living as a celebrity with personal problems in the public eye. He conveys this through the image of lights and the story of a troubled family  domestic abuse, imprisonment, separation/divorce etc. The song serves as a literal story of troubles in the home, and also as a metaphor for Kanyes struggles with fame and his relation to hip-hop.

Although the song has contributions from 14 other renowned artists (including Drake, Alicia Keys, John Legend, and more), they are listed as additional vocalists in the liner notes. Rihanna is solely credited as the featured artist on the single.

After its release, Kanye said that he had worked for over 2 years on the song, working with many other artists because he just couldnt find the one.
Lyrics:

[Post-Chorus: Elly Jackson & Rihanna]
Fast cars, shooting stars

If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Somethin' wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

Release Date: November 22, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-dark-fantasy-lyrics
Song Description: Preceded by the darkest period of Kanyes life, which culminated in the infamous Taylor Swift incident, this conceptual album digs deeper into the dark side of fame.

This track mainly showcases the side of fame people first think of, but Nickis intro and the mourning hook indicate well hear something different.

Although a music video wasnt released, its the first track featured in Kanyes full-length film Runaway.
Lyrics:

[Produced by Kanye West & RZA]
[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered-down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen
[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)

Mercy, mercy me, that Murciélago
That's me the first year that I blow

Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato? (You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-Town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise

Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh

At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
Saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris
[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)

Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-hold-my-liquor-lyrics
Song Description: This song represents Kanyes inner demons fighting for control. In Justin Vernons hook hes trying to hold everything in, but in Chief Keefs hook hes exposing himself for the world to see and not caring about consequences. This is all followed by a reckless verse that indicates the I'mma let you finish Kanye that weve come to know won the inner battle.
Lyrics:

[Produced by Arca, Kanye West, Mike Dean, and Noah Goldstein]
[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I can hold my liquor
But this man can't handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm onto Indiana
I heard it in the radio now
[Refrain: Chief Keef]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas, they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me
[Verse: Kanye West]
Bitch, I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I parked my Range Rover
Slightly scratched your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin' on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin'
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa
These the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch, you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner
Baby girl, he's a loner"
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that, he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
"When it's over, it's over"
And, bitch, I'm back out my coma

Title: Pt. 2
Release Date: February 14, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-pt-2-lyrics
Song Description: The second part of Father Stretch My Hands details Kanyes most personal momentsfrom not having time to call his wife due to work, to talking about his mothers death.

Hours before the albums launch event on February 11, 2016, Kanye revealed that his own father served as inspiration for the track, and that he was brought to tears during its creation. This is in contrast to the Gospel use of the term father (as in Part 1), referring to God.

Kanyes father, Ray West, left him and his mother Donda when he was 3 years old. Donda said the reason they divorced was because Ray put his work before her and Kanye. Kanye reflects on his fathers decisions and how he doesnt want to make the same mistakes with his family.

https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/697834509069377536

The track heavily features a sample of Panda from G.O.O.D. Musics newest signee, Desiigner.

Title: Waves
Release Date: February 14, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-waves-lyrics
Song Description: Waves is about Kanyes relationships with loved ones. Waves never truly die; they flux and reflux, but are ever present. The song features Chris Brown, who first worked with Ye on Down in 2007. This marks the duos third collaboration, after also joining on Deuces (Remix).

Chance the Rapper is credited with completing this song. When Kanye shared the tracklists first version of The Life Of Pablo (then called SWISH), Waves was originally part of it. The song was scrapped when Kanye revealed the final album title. After the Yeezy Season 3 presentation/album listening event in Madison Square Garden, the album release was delayed because Chance The Rapper insisted that Waves" should be on the album. This led to Kanye making fun of the situation on Twitter while Chance shared that he was proud of his decision. Chance The Rapper also co-wrote Waves, there is a demo shared of the original version in Chances interview with Zane Lowe.

Title: FML
Release Date: February 14, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-fml-lyrics
Song Description: Kanye West addresses his haters on FML. While the acronym typically stands for Fuck My Life, the second line reveals that, for Kanye, it might also mean: For My Lady. This symbolizes the difficulties Kanye may be facing as he struggles with fame, self control, and staying faithful to his then-wife, Kim Kardashian.

Kanyes openness with his emotions seemingly resulted in a strong marriage without major arguments, initiallya contrast from his younger self, as depicted in such songs as November 2010s All of the Lights.. Unfortunately, Kim filed for divorce in February 2021, ending the concept of Kimyea portmanteau of the celebrity power couples names.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been livin' without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
'Bout my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

One last thing I need to let you know

Remember that last time, the episode?
Asking me why the hell I text in code?
Four times just to say, "Don't text me, ho"
Told you four times, "Don't test me, ho"
And we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called "Check-a-ho"
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called "Check-a-ho"
And I...
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
[Outro: Kanye West & Section 25]
See through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them
Throw them away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Don't now, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
See through the veil
They don't wanna see me love you
And forget all your cares
They don't wanna see me love you
Throw them
Throw them away
Ooh, life's a feeling and
Ooh, the body is a feeling, yeah138Embed

Title: Lift Yourself
Release Date: April 27, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-lift-yourself-lyrics
Song Description: On April 27, 2018, Kanye announced on Twitter that he would be releasing a new song titled Lift Yourself. According to Ye, the song would bring closure to Hot 97 radio presenter, Ebro Darden.

This was three days after Ebro went on air to discuss the conversation he had with West concerning his support for Donald Trump and his alleged opioid addiction. Kanye then made a bizarre phone call to Ebros radio show, declaring that he loves him.

Later the same day, Kanye posted another tweet, linking to his website where he had uploaded the song.

Hours after the release of Lift Yourself, Power 106 premiered the T.I.-featuring Ye Vs. The People. This track serves as a better explanation to Ebro and was supposedly the lead single to Kanyes upcoming album.

Almost a month after the release of Lift Yourself, Kanye interpolated his poopy-di-scoop line in his verse on Pusha-Ts What Would Meek Do?
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Amnesty]
Hard to see, ooh
The hang ups we have today
Said we need to strive for more liberty
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Hard to see, ooh
The hang ups we have today
Said we need to strive for more liberty
Lift yourself up on your feet
Lift yourself up on your feet

Title: So Appalled
Release Date: September 24, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-so-appalled-lyrics
Song Description: So Appalled was originally released as part of the G.O.O.D Fridays series on September 24, 2010. The song touches on fame, critics and popular culture.

At one point, the song was due to be scrapped after leaking, however, Pusha T persuaded West to add it to his album regardless:

It was actually just Ye on it. I had already raved over the record because it leaked. I was like listen, there is no way this cant be on your album, youd have to be crazy. He was like Really, you think so? I was like cmon man we got to stop treating rap like oh it came out its dead. When its good, we have to make people love it and digest it.

CyHi The Prynce was brought in to perform the hook duties, but after Kanye fell asleep in the studio, CyHi recorded a full verse that West ended up keeping.

Swizz Beatz later revealed a minor gripe he has with his vocals on this track:

I just never understood why my part was never cleaned up. If you hear, my voice skips on it. I dont know if he didnt want to mess with my craft. I dont know what it was, but everything was last-minute. Every time I hear it, it drives me crazy.
Lyrics:

[Produced by Kanye West, Mike Dean & No I.D.]

[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm so appalled, Spalding, ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin' hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean, goddamn
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
Thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin' beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil', so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fuckin' insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fuckin' not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fuckin' ridiculous

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil' in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watchin' it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove', leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spillin', I own you all, yuugh
[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous

Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
[Verse 4: CyHi The Prynce]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment, "Thou shalt not hate, kid"
My movement is like the Civil Rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn, another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart, hah
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[Chorus: RZA]
Ayy, yo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fuckin' ridiculous

Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous, huh?

Title: All Day
Release Date: March 2, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-all-day-lyrics
Song Description: Originally mentioned in an interview with GQ on June 21st, 2014, All Day took all day to release, debuting 8 months later at the 2015 Brit Awards alongside grime artists Skepta, Novelist, Stormzy, Jammer, Krept & Konan, and 30 goons.

The track features little-known Minnesota artist Allan Kingdom, the ever present Theophilus London, and Sir Paul McCartney for his third collaboration with Ye.

The melody of the song was inspired by a tune whistled by McCartney in a Parkinson Interview in 1999. This tune can be heard at the end of the song.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFBKXQILeqI

All Day was the centerpiece of 2014s So Help Me God before that album was scrapped. It may have inspired the albums second title, SWISH, but had been removed from the album by the time the first SWISH (finally called The Life Of Pablo) tracklist was released in January 2016.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Kanye West & Theophilus London]

Title: Blame Game
Release Date: November 22, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-blame-game-lyrics
Song Description: This entire song can be taken two different ways: One, Kanye is talking about his relationship with fame (pretty easy to see metaphor-wise). Two, hes talking about a specific girl in his life.

Also seems easy to see (almost too easy, which is why a lot of people believe it to only be about fame), but the last lines of the song before Chris Rock comes in tells us that Ye could be talking about a real person, and Chris Rock is sketching a real conversation 'Ye heard on the phone (titled The Best Birthday).

This song is especially interesting in its duality of being quite depressing, and having a hilarious outro (your mileage may vary, though).
Lyrics:

[Produced by DJ Frank E, Kanye West & Mike Dean]

[Intro: Kanye West]
Whose fault?

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Bridge: John Legend]
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

[Chorus: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
On the bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fuckin' self
'Til about 2 a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help
You might also like[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You weren't perfect, but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Grippin' you up, fuckin' and chokin' you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't gettin' this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be havin' mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other niggas is strokin' you
Lie and say I hit you, he sittin' there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm callin' your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl
You gettin' blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, "Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls"
"All of the lights," she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied bein' in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained
[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
[Interlude: Kanye West]
Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything
How do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Chloe Mitchell

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
[Outro: Kanye West]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called, it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up, but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing, whole thing
["The Best Birthday": Chris Rock & Salma Kenas]

Title: I Am a God
Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-i-am-a-god-lyrics
Song Description: According to a Kanye interview in W magazine, the song was inspired by a serious diss from a major fashion designer (Hedi Slimane). A few days before Paris Fashion Week in Autumn 2012, West was informed that hed be invited to a widely anticipated runway show only on the condition that he agree not to attend any other shows. So the next day I went to the studio with Daft Punk, and I wrote I Am a God, West says. Cause its like, Yo! Nobody can tell me where I can and cant go. Man, Im the No. 1 living and breathing rock star. I am Axl Rose; I am Jim Morrison; I am Jimi Hendrix.

You cant say that you love music and then say that Kanye West cant come to your show! To even think they could tell me where I could and couldnt go is just ludicrous. Its blasphemousto rock n roll, and to music.

First played live at the Met Gala in New York on May 6th, and then again at the Governers Ball on June 9th.

Rick Rubin (Johnny Cash, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beastie Boys) served as the executive producer of Yeezus. The pair worked on minimalizing some of the albums excesses, rerecording vocals and sometimes writing entire new verses. Prior to the records release, West updated his official website to feature a short video clip of him recording this song while Rubin lays back on a chair and responds to Yeezys query as to whether he should be stacking billions or millions. The fuzzy-bearded producing legend responds millions, adding, To me its more relatable. More for the people."West told guests at the albums playback:

It was good for me to go to the god, Rick Rubin, and play him my st, ask him questions, and allow him to take this project to an entirely new level, and he made a lot of great decisions at the end and pulled it to a whole new level.

And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do

But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack

Title: I’m In It
Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-im-in-it-lyrics
Song Description: In this song Kanye goes to great lengths to describe his numerous sexual fantasies using very explicit lyrics.

The lyrics feature numerous references to the civil rights movement. Including a interpolation of a Martin Luther King Jr speech and the raised fist of the civil rights movement.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Damn, your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash

Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

Lyrics:

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair"
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it all falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this"
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some 1s that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, "Fuck the police," that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou'
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou'
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

Title: Violent Crimes
Release Date: June 1, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-violent-crimes-lyrics
Song Description: Violent Crimes chronicles Kanyes shift in perspective towards women with the birth of his children, specifically his daughters North and Chicago. He also brings up his fears about their future, and the ways they will be treated by those who have yet to have their perspectives changed.

Kanye has alluded to this idea before on We Major" where he rapped:

Until you have a daughter, thats what I call karma
And you pray to God she dont grow breasts too soon.

The track features a short spoken word outro from Nicki Minaj that closes the album. This marks her first appearance on a Ye album since 2010, when she provided the intro that began My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and a feature (often regarded as one of her best) on Monster.

Despite sounding very intimate, the song could lose some emotional value to some due to the fact that Kanye didnt write it himself. On Twitter, he disclosed that Pardison Fontaine wrote the song, and Kanye only changed two lines.

Lyrics:

[Intro: 070 Shake]
Fallin', dreamin', talkin' in your sleep
I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (Night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Verse: Kanye West]
Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off

Release Date: February 12, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-facts-charlie-heat-version-lyrics
Song Description: Facts celebrates Kanyes Adidas Yeezy Boost line and denounces his affiliation with competitor Nike. It appears that the track is simply a spur of the moment recording. Considering the topical content, most fans have cited this as a fun track to start off the new year.

The songs artwork, featuring a leaping Kanye wearing Adidas' Ultra Boosts, was taken by a fan, Talia Azadian during his performance at Powerhouse LA 2015.  The image is highly reminiscent of the classic Jordan logo:



Later, this song evoked a response from Marcus Jordan. https://twitter.com/HEIRMJ/status/683301864876580864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw




During the live presentation of Yeezy Season 3 and The Life of Pablo at the Madison Square Garden on February 11th, Kanye premiered an alternative mix of the song, featuring re-recorded vocals and production by Charlie Heat. This is the version that features on the album.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Dirt and grime and filth inside

Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are
G-G-G-Good work, Charlie

[Chorus]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman

Herzog and Adidas, man, you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man, they would have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man, they would have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk, they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', now y'all get the message?!
On the field, I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (You!)
Ten-thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (You!)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (You!)
I done wore designers I won't wear again
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant

Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute
(We did)
Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (You!)
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production (You!)
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama mama house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (Sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man, it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah, ain't that the truth?

Title: Flashing Lights
Release Date: November 12, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-flashing-lights-lyrics
Song Description: In Flashing Lights, Kanye is found reminiscing about a flighty, capricious ex-girlfriend he cant stop thinking about.

Similar to Homecoming, Kanye uses this girl as a metaphor for his public audience, to whose chaotic whims hes forced to cater to.

There is also a video filmed during a studio session for Kanyes 2010 magnum opus My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy with Ye and longtime collaborator Charlie Wilson when they jam to the Flashing Lights instrumental. They sang the song with a new hook that goes:

Hey everybody, tonights the night
Ive been waiting my whole life
Who would have known what it was like?
Running from these flashing lights

The song was later given to K-Pop group JYJ for their song Ayy Girl, which also featured Malik Yusef.

You more like love to start shit
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you, Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis
[Chorus: Dwele & Connie Mitchell]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know?

What do I know? Know

I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doin' my thing
I know I was foul, baby
A-bay, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Frontin' though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', "Hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar"

Title: Through the Wire
Release Date: September 30, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-through-the-wire-lyrics
Song Description: On October 23, 2002, Kanye crashed his car and fractured his jaw. The Through the Wire title comes from the fact that Kanye recorded the original version while his mouth was still wired shut. The track samples Chaka Khans Through The Fire.

Through the Wire became certified platinum on  November 20, 2018.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yo, G, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Post-Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this, right here, history in the makin', man
You might also like[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Post-Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Outro]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said, "Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"
"It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"
You can't be serious, man

Title: I Thought About Killing You
Release Date: June 1, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-i-thought-about-killing-you-lyrics
Song Description: I Thought About Killing You is the opening track from Kanye Wests eighth studio album, ye. The song debuted during Wests album premiere in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on May 31, 2018. Kanye discusses mental strength, different forms of love, and not letting his opponents get to him. He discusses his dark thoughts at length throughout emotional passages, revealing his struggle with suicidal ideation. During the spoken-word segment, Kanye uses a pitch-shift effect on his voice, signifying the bipolar nature of the conversation hes having with himself.

He also refers to his opioid addiction, which can cause harsh side effectsincluding depression and suicidal thoughts, respiratory depression, or a reduced ability to breathe, and more. This is further explored in the next track, Yikes. In an interview with The New York Times, Kanye was asked how much of the song is meant to be literal and how much of it is metaphorical, and he responded, Ive thought about killing myself all the time. Its always a option and [expletive]. Like Louis C.K. said: I flip through the manual. I weigh all the options.

At 3:10, the beat switches to a more atmospheric and aggressive mood. This section samples the 2017 track Fr3sh by Kareem Lotfy, which was released on the compilation Mono No Aware, put together by Berlin-based record label, Pan. Kanye spent some alone-time in Berlin around the time of the 2018 Grammys; one of the few moments he was spotted in public during his hiatus while creating this album. On November 7, 2018, the beat switch was updated to not include Kareems sample, but rather a similar interpolation of it. This change is most prevalent in the Spotify version.

Pitchfork reported that the band didnt receive proper credit for the sample. Francis, of Francis and the Lights, reached out on Twitter, stating that he added the beat last minute and meant no harm or foul play.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Francis and the Lights & Kanye West]
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it

[Spoken Word: Kanye West]
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say "don't say this, don't say that"
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

Lyrics:

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless

Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk (Me)
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Bridge]
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night
[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless? (How, how?)
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Title: Only One
Release Date: December 31, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-only-one-lyrics
Song Description: Only One is the first song released by Kanye West since his sixth studio album Yeezus.  Its an R&B song co-produced by Sir Paul McCartney and sung from the perspective of Kanyes late mother, Dr. Donda West as she looks down on her son from Heaven.

Critics have compared the songs stripped down aesthetic and auto-tuned vocals to those on 808s & Heartbreak, Kanyes fourth studio album. In a press release, Kanye said that he couldnt remember singing the song when the lines were played back to him, and he concluded that Donda was sending him a message. During an interview with The Breakfast Club, Kanye also mentioned some of the lyrics seemed to be channeled from his grandmother.

Its worth noting that in jeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy, Kanye in 2002 shared that his name meant the only one in Amharic.

The song debuted at number 35 on the Hot 100, making it Paul McCartneys first top 40 hit in the U.S. in over 25 years (My Brave Face reached number 25 on the charts in 1989).

Only One was slated to be on Wests So Help Me God in 2014, but after not releasing that album, West dropped the song to iTunes on New Years Eve 2014. It was dropped from the album sometime between 2014 and the release of the first SWISH tracklist in January 2016.

As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, ‘cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
‘Cause every road that leads to Heaven's right inside you
So I can say

[Chorus]
Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day, you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

[Chorus]
Hello my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless

Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor, the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well, mama, I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope

(Jesus, walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long

[Verse 2]
To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers
(Jesus walks with them)
To the victims of welfare, feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks with them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models, we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God, my record won't get played, huh?
Well, if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope it take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' 'bout
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out
[Chorus]
(Jesus, walk)
God, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

Title: Homecoming
Release Date: September 11, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-homecoming-lyrics
Song Description: Interpolating a line from Commons I Used To Love H.E.R., Kanye uses extended metaphor to describe his feelings for Chicago, his home, by comparing it to a lost girlfriend.

Ye had these lines kicking around for a while: they originally appeared on his debut mixtape Get Well Soon.. (which was made up of material recorded before The College Dropout) in a song called Home.

For Homecoming, he replaced that songs soul sample with a looped piano, switched out the John Legend hook for a different one from Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, and rerecorded his original verse as two separate verses.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah
And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!
[Chorus: Chris Martin & Kanye West]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah)
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)
-Min' home again

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me, but
My name is Windy and I like to blow trees," and
From that point, I'd never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me"
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me"

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes, I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you," and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again

Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again

Now I'm comin' home again

Title: Highlights
Release Date: February 14, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-highlights-lyrics
Song Description: Highlights is a celebration of Kanyes career and accomplishments. He reflects on 21 Grammy wins and promises fans hes only going to make more highlights in the future.

This is Kanyes sixth song with lights in the title; Graduations Flashing Lights, 808s & Heartbreaks Street Lights, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasys All of the Lights, the opening to The Life of Pablo, Ultralight Beam,  and the preceding song Low Lights.

Like one of Kanyes previous lights songs, All of the Lights, Highlights is also preceded by an interlude with lights in the title. All of the Lights' interlude is simply called All of the Lights (Interlude)," while Highlights' is Low Lights.

In a deleted tweet, Young Thugs go-to music video producer Be El Be stated:

Hold up, Now that I think about it WE ARE ON THIS I remember the song title b/c I wrote it down, I think I have it written down in my phone.. I just know the song wasnt really done. But thug re sang the hook and added a verse.

This led to speculation that Young Thug would be making a guest appearance on The Life of Pablo (titled SWISH at the time). The two have apparently recorded over 40 songs together, but this is their first collaboration to see the light of day.

An early demo of the track featuring Madonna surfaced Feb. 19, 2016.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Kanye West with Kelly Price & Young Thug]

Title: Jail
Release Date: August 29, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-jail-lyrics
Song Description: Jail is the triumphant return of Kanye West and JAY-Z, also known as The Throne. The duo has now made amends after their once brotherly relationship stood still. This is the first track that the two have been on together since Drakes 2016 single Pop Style, where JAY-Z only appeared for two lines.

Jail also serves as the beginning of DONDAs narrative structure. We find Kanye in the midst of a crisis, spiraling out of control as his marriage falls apart and his public image falls apart once again.

JAY-Z recorded his verse at 4PM on July 22, 2021, just four hours before the first Donda listening party at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Kanye West]
Take what you want
Take everything

Violence in the night, violence in the night
Priors, priors, do you have any priors?
Well, that one time
I'll be honest, I'll be honest
We all liars
Let it go

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
I'll be honest, we all liars

Told him, "Stop all of that red cap, we goin' home"
Not me with all of these sins, castin' stones
This might be the return of The Throne (Throne)
Hova and Yeezus, like Moses and Jesus
You are not in control of my thesis
You already know what I think 'bout think pieces
Before you ask, he already told you who he think he is
Don't try to jail my thoughts and think precincts
I can't be controlled with programs and presets
Reset
On my cell, in my cell tonight
Don't have to see you to touch you
This is what braille look like, it's on sight
If they take me to jail, call my girl, tell her send my mail
We know what Hell look like
Still, it's a hell of a life, yikes

Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?

Title: Fade
Release Date: September 16, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-fade-lyrics
Song Description: On Fade, Kanye calls out to a distant lover, claiming theyre not 100% invested in their relationship. He can feel them slipping away.

Fade is built off of four samples: Fingers Inc.s Mystery of Love (Club Mix), Hardrives house song, Deep Inside, Ms. Barbara Tuckers vocals from I Get Lifted, and  Rare Earths (I Know) Im Losing You.

Kanye premiered the video for Fadeat the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards. It stars Teyana Taylor and was inspired by Flashdance.

Title: Good Morning
Release Date: September 11, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-good-morning-lyrics
Song Description: Kanyes intro to his third album, Graduation, is a wake-up call to himself and the world. It also gives Kanye a chance to show off his polished lyrical abilities.

The song is part of a larger metaphor: The album Graduation is Kanyes graduation in the rap game. Good Morning is told as if Kanye is waking up on his Graduation Day, reminiscing about his college days and finally receiving his rapping degree in the third verse. The school/college theme is very present throughout the song.

Kanye samples Jay-Zs The Rulers Back and Elton Johns Someone Saved My Life Tonight (both artists have been featured on one of Kanyes songs).

On a side note, as if writing and producing this track wasnt enough, Ye also developed a creative storyline for a video  despite the song never being released as an actual single.

The music video for Good Morning is essentially the result of Japanese pop artist Takashi Murakami bringing to life the various designs he had composed for Graduations album artwork through the use of cel-shaded animation.

Title: On Sight
Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-sight-lyrics
Song Description: On Sight was a strategic move for Kanye. Instead of putting a catchy song like Blood On The Leaves at the beginning as he has done in the past with songs like Good Morning, Say You Will and Dark Fantasy he opts for a more rough introduction to convey his anger and frustration that is a recurring theme throughout Yeezus.

Kanye explained it best in an interview with Big Boy at Power 106 Los Angeles:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuPQ7Wg06WI&t=1m35s
Lyrics:

[Produced by Benji B, Daft Punk, Kanye West & Mike Dean]

[Verse 1: Kanye West]

Fuck whatever y'all been hearin'
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearin'
A monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinson's
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran, hah!

Title: I Wonder
Release Date: September 11, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-i-wonder-lyrics
Song Description: Revered among fans, I Wonder is an emotional anthem that deals with the theme of finding ones dreams.

This song is largely inspired by U2s City of Blinding Lights, which the band often performed at live shows to much applause. Kanye went on U2s The Vertigo Tour as a supporting act in 2006, and after witnessing the praise they received when opening concerts, he sought to achieve stadium status through anthemic music.

The soulful piano and vocals were sampled from Labi Siffres 1972 track My Song, off his album Crying Laughing Loving Lying. Although West used a soul sample, the production contrasts many of his former songs due to the layered electronic synths and loud drum patterns.

Kanye noted in an interview with Concrete Loop that he simplified the lyrics on I Wonder so his listeners could identify with the record:

I was like you know what? I dont need to over rap and thats how you get a song like I Wonder. [] I didnt even try. I just zoned out, Id go into the studio and vibe to the beat and it just came to meGod gave me the words.
Lyrics:

[Produced by Kanye West]

[Intro: Labi Siffre]
Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Labi Siffre]
I've been waitin' on this my whole life (And I wonder)
These dreams be wakin' me up at night (And I wonder)
You say I think I'm never wrong (And I wonder)
You know what? Maybe you're right, aight?
[Chorus: Labi Siffre]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Labi Siffre]
You say he get on your fuckin' nerves (And I wonder)
You hope that he get what he deserves—word! (And I wonder)
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just tryna find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet, and that's what intuition is (And I wonder)
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib, run back to their arms
The smokescreens, the chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means?

And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline, told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's why I'm (And I wonder)
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God callin' from the hotlines
Why he keep givin' me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine? (And I wonder)
How many ladies in the house? (If you know)
How many ladies in the house without a spouse? (What it means)
Somethin' in your blouse got me feelin' so aroused (What it means)
What you about? (And I wonder)
On that independent shit (If you know)
Trade it all for a husband and some kids (What it means)
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?
(To find your dreams come true)

Title: Last Call
Release Date: February 10, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-last-call-lyrics
Song Description: On The College Dropouts final track (hence the title), Kanye West tells his story from being just a producer to the Yeezy we all know and love.

The track was originally produced by fellow rapper/producer Evidence from the West Coast rap group Dilated Peoples. He created this track from a stack of records he got from his associate Porse, and after Kanye worked with Dilated Peoples on the track This Way in 2004, Evidence gave the track to Kanye with the intention of him giving it to Jay-Z. After Jay decided not to use the track, Kanye took it and re-produced it, which Evidence explained in an interview with HipHopDX:

The reason it says [it was] produced by both of us [is because] the sample didnt clear. He went and had an orchestra come in and replay shit. A musicologist, he really took it to a level I couldnt have musically. Instruments were played on top, he added drums to my drums and he really took it there. I think the version I turned in to him was just as raw because I love the loop and the drum sound of it, but his is really well-produced. So when it says it was produced by both of us, its well-deserved. Im not disputing that or anything like that.

The track samples Bette Midlers Mr. Rockefeller

And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me ten seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with JAY-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
"Oh my god, is that a black card?"
I turned around and replied, "Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express"
Brains, power, and muscle
Like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle
You know what I've been up to
Killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips
[Chorus: Kanye West]

[Outro]
So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the "Truth" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin'?" I'm like "It's me." He's like "Oh, well okay."
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, "Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"

No ID: "Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap"

[Saxophone Solo]
I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop: "I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper"]

I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that "Truth" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, "Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off "Xxplosive" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "This Can't Be Life."

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, "Oh you a real soulful dude."
[JAY-Z: "Oh you a real soulful dude, man"]
And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

[JAY-Z: "Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"]

"Tell me what you think of this." And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, "What you think of it?"

[JAY-Z: "So what you think of this?"]

And I was like, "Man that shit tight," you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

[Donda West: "Come on, let's just go"]

...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...

[Donda West: "Kanye, baby, we're here"]

...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, "Heart of the City." And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did "Nothing Like It" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, "Yo play that one beat for him." And I played "Heart of the City." And really I made "Heart of the City," I really wanted to give that beat to DMX

[Hiphop: "No I think Jay gon' like this one right here"]

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, "Yo what's up I'm Kanye."

[Dame: "Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"]

"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats"

[Dame: "Jay got classics, G."]

You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like "oh shit." And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, "yo Jay I could rap." And I spit this rap that said, uh "I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips." And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, "Man that was tight."
[JAY-Z: "That, that was cool. That was hot."]

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, "H to the Izzo," my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. "Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z." You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, "yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them "Jesus Walks" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, "Naw." Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

[Jessica: "Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."]

I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up

["Y'all niggas is stupid"]

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad
[Joe: "We gonna change the game, buddy."]

Dame was like, "Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay, man, just make sure it's not wack."

[Dame: "You gotta make sure it's not wack."]

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'
"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like "oh shit"

[Dame: "Oh shit it's not even wack."]

"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."

[Dame: "it's actually kinda hot."]

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like "yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick"

[Dame: "you don't wanna catch a brick"]

"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on." I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, "oh, word?" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer-rapper," and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, "yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"

[Mel: "Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."]

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?"
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?

Title: Wouldn’t Leave
Release Date: June 1, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-wouldnt-leave-lyrics
Song Description: Kanye dedicates Wouldnt Leave to his wife Kim Kardashian. Throughout the song, he references past errors such as his rant on Sway in the Morning or the TMZ interview during which he called slavery a choice. Despite these incidents, which got him into some trouble, Kim stayed by his side. Kanye expresses his gratitude to her, appreciating that she didnt leave him and that she sticks with him in hard times.

Here we get to see the sensitive side of Kanye, regretting his past utterances and shouting out all the women in the world that put up with their significant others choices, like Kim did with his.
We also see him describing how, though he is a free thinker and that his so-called fans love this particular quality of him, he is still bashed and shamed for thinking such a way.

Wouldnt Leave was first teased as one of two tentative track titles for ye, which were seen on a whiteboard shortly before the albums release. Along with all other tracks, it was first shown in a listening party broadcast from Jackson Hole, Wyoming which could be accessed through the app WAV.

Lyrics:

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Kanye West]
I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin
And I don't feel like
And I know you wouldn't leave

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They say, "Build your own"—I said, "How, Sway?"
I said, "Slavery a choice"—they said, "How, Ye?"
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now, I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls
My wife callin', screamin', say we 'bout to lose it all
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't leave

[Bridge: Jeremih]

We doin' such things

Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time somethin' happen, they want me sent to mental
We had an incident, but I cover incidentals
You want me workin' on my messagin'
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson
But soundin' like George Jefferson
Then they questionin' my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again
Then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two, but me and you, that's infinity

For every down female that stuck with they dude
Through the best times, through the worst times, this for you

Title: Moon
Release Date: August 29, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-moon-lyrics
Song Description: The mellow and calming sound of Moon evolved majorly throughout the course of its existence, originally acting as an interlude with a repetitive chorus sung by Don Toliver. Moon premiered as the eighth track at the Donda album listening party on July 23, 2021, in Atlanta, Georgia at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

Only two weeks later, on August 5, 2021, at the second listening party, Moon was played as the second track. This enhanced version shortened Tolivers chorus and then featured Kanye along with his long-time collaborator and friend, Kid Cudi. With this second version, Cudi contributed a verse along with ad-libs in a revised, second chorus which featured new lyrics and vocal parts thanks to Kanye West.

To the surprise of many, on August 26, at the controversial third and final listening event, Moon was played as the twelfth track, excerpting Kid Cudi and Kanyes contributions. The stripped-down track only featured Tolivers looped vocals, with some background vocals provided by the Sunday Service Choir.

When the album released on August 29, 2021, Moon was restored to its second version containing all the original features.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
I wanna go to the moon, don't leave so soon (Don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)
I wanna go to the moon, don't leave so soon (Don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)
I wanna go to the moon, don't leave so soon (Don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
Mhm, here we go strappin', we up
Never forget all the memories
Sittin', I sip out my cup
Thinkin' I should be a better me
Truly I'm blessed from the start
So much to say in these melodies, oh
Stare at the sky, the moon singin' sweet
Oh, my God, such a sweet moment
Angels, they say I'm not ever weak, such a lonely moment
Heaven knows I might never sleep, trouble in my soul
Hey, I've been prayin', life can be drainin', oh
Hey, we were late, tryna keep haulin' on
I'm ashamed and yet, what I will see, ain't nobody knows, so I go

[Chorus: Don Toliver, Kanye West & Kid Cudi]
How can I get through? (Don't leave so soon)
How can I get through? (To the moon)
How can I get through? (To the moon)
Early afternoon, I wanna go to the moon (Take you to the moon)
Don't leave so soon (Woah)
Don't leave so soon
How could I get through? (Yeah)
How can I get through? (Ooh)
Early afternoon, I wanna go to the moon (Ooh, take you to the moon)
Don't leave so soon (Ooh)
Don't leave so soon (Don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)

Title: Follow God
Release Date: October 25, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-follow-god-lyrics
Song Description: Kanye West revisits the spiritual themes of his February 2016 track, Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1, on its 2019 successor, Follow God. On the soulful track, Kanye flips a sample of Whole Truths 1974 track, Can You Lose By Following God to discuss the way he struggles to live a religious life and follow Gods direction in face of the difficulties that God presents.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You

[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like" (Stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"
You might also like[Outro]
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad (Stretch my hands to You)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"

Title: Closed on Sunday
Release Date: October 25, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-closed-on-sunday-lyrics
Song Description: Kanye West continues with the gospel theme of the album, naming Closed on Sunday after an important concept in Christianity. While Saturday is technically the Sabbath in Judaism, Sunday is considered to be a holy day of rest for most Christians. In the Bible, there are numerous passages that specifically state the significance of resting one day out of the week. In Exodus 20:8-11, it is listed as the fourth commandment:

Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

In the chorus, Kanye alludes to the famous, Christian-owned fast food chain, Chick-fil-A, and discusses the way their stores are closed on this day. The outro is spoken by A$AP Bari, who is also known as Young Lord. He confirmed the vocal feature and thanked Ye for putting him on the track via his Instagram story.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Closed on Sunday, you're my Chick-fil-A
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
Hold the selfies, put the 'Gram away
Get your family, y'all hold hands and pray
When you got daughters, always keep 'em safe
Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
You're my number one, with the lemonade
Raise our sons, train them in the faith
Through temptations, make sure they're wide awake
Follow Jesus, listen and obey
No more livin' for the culture, we nobody's slave

[Verse]
Stand up for my home
Even if I take this walk alone
I bow down to the King upon the throne
My life is His, I'm no longer my own
I pray to God that He'll strengthen my hand
They will think twice steppin' onto my land
I draw the line, it's written in the sand
Try me and you will see that I ain't playin'
Now, back up off my family, move your hands
I got my weapons in the spirit's land
I, Jezebel don't even stand a chance
Jezebel don't even stand a chance

Title: Touch the Sky
Release Date: August 30, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-touch-the-sky-lyrics
Song Description: Produced by Just Blaze, using a slowed down sample from Curtis Mayfields Move On Up, a style that Kanye also employs.

This song notably features Lupe Fiascos first big breakthrough. He dropped Food & Liquor a year later.

Fun fact: Kanye was sued by Evel Knievel for the music video of this song, because Kanye used images and patterns that matched Knievels trademarked suit. It was settled when Knievel met Kanye, calling him quite a gentleman.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: "Dawg, in due time!"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven

Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dawg, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now
[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh
[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Outro: Kanye West]
We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
Sky, sky high! I’m, I’m sky high!
Yeah, keep it rollin'!
Yeah, uh, feels good to be home, baby!
Feels good to be home!

Title: Lost In the World
Release Date: November 22, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-lost-in-the-world-lyrics
Song Description: According to Kanye, the verse began as a poem he emailed to Kim Kardashian because he had the beat but no lyrics. He made the revelation at his Glastonbury 2015 headline set.

This song was featured in Kanyes movie Runaway as the closing track.

The songs introduction and the choruss interpolation are from Bon Ivers Woods from their EP Blood Bank. The chorus structure mimics Bon Ivers song structure. While Bon Iver laments about the woods, West expands the scope of the song outside of the woods to the city and beyond to America as a whole.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still, down the time
[Chorus: Kanye West & Justin Vernon]
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night, said she's down for the night
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Slow down the time), ooh
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night
[Verse: Kanye West]
You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma-ma-se, ma-ma-se, ma-ma-ku-sa
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night

[Bridge: Gil Scott Heron & Kanye West]
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America? (Down for the night)
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night, down for the night
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night, down for a night
Oh-oh, get down

'Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa

Whipped it out, she said, "I never seen Snakes on a Plane"
Whether you broke or rich, you gotta get this
Havin' money's not everythin', not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on trips
But when I get my card back activated, I'm back to Vegas
(Welcome to the good life)
'Cause I always had a passion for flashin'
Before I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life

When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmama
Ain't the only girl callin' me baby
If you feelin' me now, then put yo' hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say, "Hey, hey" (Hey, hey, hey)
(Ooh) I'm good!

Title: Jesus Lord
Release Date: August 29, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-jesus-lord-lyrics
Song Description: Jesus Lord was the last song played at the listening party for Donda in Las Vegas. At least part of Kanyes verse seems to have been written by the rapper Rooga. Before Kanyes live performance, multiple snippets of the song had surfaced online.

The song was eventually played in full on August 6, 2021, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and it features a verse from Jay Electronica.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin'
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus)
I watched so many people leave (Lord)
I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's sеasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in
I know I madе a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losin' all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while I introduce the party, you say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
You better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
Is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
Even let him get the last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, "****, stand still" (Jesus)
"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry" (Lord)
"Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ"
He said, "Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ"
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)
I never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In Tepoztlán, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel
My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took a L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me, it kinda feels like
Me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids
Have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals
For being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him
And it is what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one
My father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man
I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
Who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)

Rockstar, bitch, call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killin', while I'm drillin'
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night, my bitches came in twos
And they both sucked like they came to lose
Dropped out first day of school

I be goin' hard, I got a name to prove
Killin' 'em, honey, how I make the pain improve

[Chorus: King Louie]

We can send this bitch up, it can go down

We can send this bitch up, it can go down

When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men

Title: Jonah
Release Date: August 29, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-jonah-lyrics
Song Description: Jonah is a tribute to Jonah Ware, an independent recording artist from Louisville, Kentucky, who was shot and killed on August 8, 2020.

The track features Houston singer Vory and Chicago rapper Lil Durk, marking their first collaborations with Kanye, along with background vocals from Yes frequent collaborator Ty Dolla $ign.

On the songs melancholy chorus, Vory laments feelings of isolation and loneliness, expressing despair in fighting his metaphorical demons without the support of his significant other. This mirrors the betrayal, and resulting pain and trauma, that Kanye experienced during his divorce from Kim Kardashian, which he expressed on the song Never Abandon Your Family..

In October 2020, Kanye and Durk sparked collaboration rumors after being spotted together in Atlanta.

A snippet of the song surfaced on December 5, 2020, as a solo Vory song. The song was later given to Kanye for Donda and played at the Atlanta listening party on July 22, 2021, with a Lil Durk feature and no Kanye vocals.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Vory]
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own

[Verse 1: Vory]
Hard to keep my focus on what matters
Mandem hit my line like, "Some **** just got hit up on your block"
You can rest assured it's not us
'Cause we been out the wavе catchin' waves
They say, "We ain't seen you on thе block"
'Cause I been out the way
Chasin' millions in my sleep, I found the better way
Somewhere on an island, let me kick it, this my getaway
I pour up a drink for all my **** who ain't see the day
Tryna finish this with who I started with
Way too many fallen soldiers, no, I can't forgot
Hope they got headphones up in Heaven
You can vibe out and just hear this ****
It's just certain **** you can't forget

[Chorus: Vory]
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone

[Outro: Vory]
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own
Like who's here when I need a shoulder to lean on?
I hope you're here when I need them demons to be gone
And it's not fair that I had to fight 'em all on my own45Embed

Title: Selah
Release Date: October 25, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-selah-lyrics
Song Description: In October 2018, Kanye West teased a snippet of the Ronny J-produced Selah during an Instagram livestream. A second snippet of the track appeared online on September 25, 2019.  The track was teased a third time on October 23, 2019, in a promotion for the album and the IMAX film.

The title further establishes the biblical theme of JESUS IS KING, as selah () is a common Hebrew word found in the Book of Psalms. In total, it is used 71 times, but the meaning is still relatively unknown; however, scholars theorize that it means to lift up or exalt.

During the Jesus Is King: A Kanye West Experience listening session on September 28 in Chicago, Kanye stated that Selah means to look back and reflect upon.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
God is King, we the soldiers
Ultrabeam out the solar
When I get to Heaven's gates
I ain’t gotta peek over
Keepin' perfect composure
When I scream at the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I’m just focused
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
Pour the lean out slower
Got us clean out of soda
Before the flood, people judge
They did the same thing to Noah
Everybody wanted Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on Monday
But the strong start on Sunday
Won't be in bondage to any man
John 8:33
We the descendants of Abraham
Ye should be made free
John 8:36
To whom the son set free is free indeed
He saved a wretch like me

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, He is wonderful

If you woke, then wake up
With Judas, kiss and make up
Even with the bitter cup
Forgave my brothers and drank up
Did everything but gave up
Stab my back, I can't front
Still we win, we prayed up
Even when we die, we raise up (Hallelujah)
Ain't no wantin', no, we need it
The powers that be done been greedy
We need ours by this evening
No white flag or no treaty
We got the product, we got the tools
We got the minds, we got the youth
We goin' wild, we on the loose
People is lying, we are the truth
Everything old shall now become new
The leaves’ll be green, bearing the fruit
Love God and our neighbor, as written in Luke
The army of God and we are the truth

Title: Never See Me Again
Release Date: October 23, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-never-see-me-again-lyrics
Song Description: Never See Me Again displays a spotlight for Kanye Wests mental state, heavily speculated about being recorded before his infamous self exile out of the United States.

Leading up to the songs eventual leak, Kanyes and his now ex-fiance Alexis Phifer had broken up due to [citing a conflict with his life on the road], a year previous his mother Donda West had passed away in November 10, 2007 to heart failure after plastic surgery. Following the upcoming year, heavily intoxicated at the September 2009 VMAs Kanye West delivered one of his most infamous' speech at the awards show.

Speculation for the songs existence is rumored to be recorded after the Taylor Swift incident.

Some have also noted that theres a subtle similarity between this track and the contrastingly titled See Me Now from this same era.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
And it'll be a long time, before you ever see me again, me again

[Verse 1]
They want me, hold my head in shame
So I hold 'em on, holding hands in vain
Covers talkin', now the feds say I'm insane
A psych said I'm gonna fumble down along the planner
And then his son told me "Put down the drink, dawg"
I got the rinks off, coming for the things off
I guess there's nothin' and I'm finna chop its head off
I need a lil' something to knock the edge off
Aside from this song, my life sucks
Stomping on someone with my boots
And I'll put it off, if we modest
And every other god needs a goddess
And every other star couldn't guide us
It falls upon something that's inside us
So I'm not gonna stop for my riders
Tell me where my ride is, tumble on the mountains, uh

[Chorus]
And I don't like them, and they don't like that
They don't like that, and I don't want that
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry about me, worry 'bout you
Or worry about something, don't worry what I do
Hey, motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again, me again
You might also like[Verse 2]
See, I need some time to meditate
Naw, bitch, I'm fly, I need time to levitate
And I don't sound try, tryna hesitate
Fumbled down, very late, nigga, you a featherweight
And I'm a heavyweight, and I'm very great
I put the everyday, rocking in every state
Do not debate, you cannot cape
I must've on faith, getting knocked of faith
Guess it's my fate, guess it was written
I can sell a phone, guess it was different
That was somethin' back then, I was different
Now I'm spitting and everybody's just spittin'
And what it sound like when everybody sound alike
What you sound like, bumpin' 'em on a round mic?
I don't even sound right, feelin' like I'm on the downright
And these niggas secondary, like Pippen around Mike
Trippin' around sight, pumpin' on that down light
I'ma be downright, you niggas is downright biters
And I'ma set fires, and my shit downright fire, from the corner buyer
And I'm alone, eh

[Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them
Just worry 'bout you, and what you gonna do?
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Worry 'bout me, I worry 'bout me
I worry 'bout you, and maybe I do, have a long day
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout you
I worry 'bout something that we can't do
And you know me, yeah, it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, na-na-na-na
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Hey, hey
Before you ever see me again, me again
Hey, hey
It'll be a long time before you ever see me
[Post-Chorus]
Can you clap your hands, hands?
Clap your, clap your hand, hands?
Clap your, clap your hand, hands?
And I wanna do something, I wanna do something then
Can you clap your hand, hands?
Need you to clap your hands, hands
Need you to clap your hands, hands
Need you to clap your hands
Need you to clap your hands, hands
Need you to clap your hands
Need you to clap your hands, hands
Need you to clap your hands, hands

[Verse 3]
So the song like a Section 8
So I pass that dick around like a collection plate
I can sell 'em on Sunday, with the fuss you made
I be stunting with the stunners, and that's the best you make
So if everybody just stand now, and shit, don't plan out
Throw your hands up, at least give them a handout
And with the sun shown, it's like the Jerome is
Mom-is-on-the-cellphone days, I'm homeless
Or feeling like Ike at the end of the movie
Wait, just need two more shows just to get to me
Or feeling like Eddie Kane, I still got it
And it's something but the problem is, you still not it
Or maybe if it's sicker, they say I'm that nigga
Or maybe if I'm humble, it's not a cellphone finger
Or maybe damn, I could just blow my shit through thinner
Maybe I should stop being real, maybe I should get on Twitter
Maybe I should know somethin' different, I could reconsider
Got something nothing seri' till the cellphone liver
And I'ma drink 'til the sun up, 'til I got no more liver
And I'ma stand and deliver 'til they pump my liver
And I'ma spit it, like it get it, kinda self, but I'm fine
I'd rather live by what I live by, then die when I'm fine
I'm gonna stand by myself 'til my very last breath
'Cause you know what? A coward dies a thousand deaths
And I'm proud when it's a sound, but now a thousand next
And I could style on you, something down to hell with this
You can't style on me, nigga, I'm out of your league
I'm liable to be a liability
You plan to style on me, trying to style on me
Nigga, I'm liable to be a liability
And my ability, I can sound like Billie Jean
[Non-Lyrical Vocals]
[Chorus 2]
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you
Worry about something, something will do
And motherfucker, it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
So don't worry about me, I'll be fine
I'll be up some, going for mine
And it'll be a long time 'fore you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you, worry 'bout you
'Fore you ever see

[Verse 4]
Don't worry about what I been up to
Where the fuck I'm going, nah, nigga, fuck you
Who the fuck is going, I can something don't ask it, who the fuck is asking?
I'll put the summer on blast and- and who the fuck is lasting?
And be the last standing, caught up on the planning
Get a better tan and I been feeling dandy
And who can run the planet? Pass them a Xanax
And an afternoon I annex and all of the damage
Left on the platter, who's soon after all?
I guess it's a small world after all
Stunting on the sun 'cause I have to ball
I run the world 'cause it's a small world after all
And I'm never after y'all
I have to loss somethin' and I got it all
And feeling like you got it all?
Humble some' [Non-Lyrical Vocals], nah, nigga, not at all

[Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me, just worry 'bout you
'cause I don't give a fuck on whatcha gon' do
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again

[Verse 5]
There's something on the all out, the call out, somethin' on the call out
Last summer, last fight, and y'all had a fall out
I can sense nothing to something, what are y'all 'bout?
Bumping nothing to something, and everything that y'all 'bout
Y'all had your ups and downs, I don't fuck around
Put everything on the something, then you go and fuck around
I put it to a style, now there's something, nothing now
Your feelings felt something, y'all don't feel nothing now
Her tears dried up, from bumping expressionless
I was under exodus and learning what the lessons is
What the ebony of essences, the Genesis
I got the fetishes, something on the sedatives
One sip and then it'll have you look at innocence
I wish we just could take it back to the Book of Genesis
Before the hook is in, is there any point of any of this?
But understand [?]
[?], put hands on you
Then put his front side, and put hands on you
Just turn around say "For really?"
I'm done motherfucker, I can state something if

[Chorus]
They worry bout me, just worry bout you, I get knocked off when I begin
And she said that
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, just worry 'bout you
And I'll be up now, what I've been up to
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Me again, me again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again

Title: Diamonds From Sierra Leone (Remix)
Release Date: August 30, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-diamonds-from-sierra-leone-remix-lyrics
Song Description: Both this remix and the original were singles from Kanyes Late Registration album. Kanye uses the remix to go into more detail on conflict diamonds: diamonds which are mined during a war and used to finance an invading army.

Meanwhile, Jay-Z steers clear of politics and uses his verse to rap about how awesome he and his record label are.

Appropriately, the beat contains a sample from the theme song of the James Bond film Diamonds are Forever by Shirley Bassey.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They are all I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me

[Chorus: Kanye West & Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever (Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe)
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever (The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme)
(Forever) Forever ever? Forever ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
(And ever) Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam, still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin', I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, mane
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryna get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it look so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, because

Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever (Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe)
Diamonds are forever

Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
(And ever) Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
[Verse 2: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
Uh
People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (Uh)
That'll be the same day I give the game back (Uh)
You know the next question, dawg, "Yo, where Dame at?" (Uh)
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back (Woo)
"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?"

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Yup
I got it from here, 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the gang is intact (Uh-huh)
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack?
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep, I sold kilos of coke (So?)
I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah
He don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear, sayin' exactly
What I been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time (Ha)
[Outro: Jay-Z]
I'm Young, bitches!
Hahahahaha
Good night!

Lyrics:

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Oh baby
Hahahaha
Turn the motherfuckin' music up
[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down

[Over Chorus: Jay-Z]
That's right, it's what I do!
C'mon, uh-huh
Nah, you know I never let you down!
Gyeah, gyeah, yuh

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, first, I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First, I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga, I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood, I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you seen the car I bought her
And you sent tears from Heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side
[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
[Verse 3: J. Ivy]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this, that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a Heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church
[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down
[Verse 4: Jay-Z & (Kanye West)]
Who else you know been hot this long?
(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong
(The Roc is in the building)
Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
Dissin' Jay, dissin' Jay'll get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please, Father forgive us'
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
The way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive90Embed

Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you

[Verse: Kanye West & Slick Rick]
Take the top off, let the sun come in (The Lord still shines on you)
Whoa, for all my dogs that stayed down, we up again (Again)
Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard
I had debt on my books, it's been a shaky-ass year
Let me make this clear, so all y'all see
I don't take advice from people less successful than me
Hah? Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
Had to tell the dogs, "Turn the snubs off"
Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost
(Believe it or not) These two wrongs'll right you
(Believe it or not) I was too grown in high school
(Believe it or not) The true soul of Ice Cube
Too close to snipe you, truth told, I like you
Too bold to type you, too rich to fight you
Calm down, you light skin

Title: Big Brother
Release Date: September 11, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-big-brother-lyrics
Song Description: Big Brother details the ups and downs of Kanyes working relationship with Jay-Z. Both sentimental and honest; Kanye runs a fine line between hero-worship and idol killing.

This is also a good example of Kanye being a different type of artist: most rappers would never have the confidence to put out a song explaining their feelings for another man, let alone a colleague and fellow rapper.
Lyrics:

[Produced by DJ Toomp]

[Intro]
Stadium status
[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out "Jigga"
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
That he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, "He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig"
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib

[Chorus]
Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel, why don't you wave your hands?

Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'Round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say "Damn! Oh, that's you?"
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like "Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?
[Verse 3]
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped "Jesus Walks" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, "New Jack City"—got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that "Diamonds" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, "I inspired me"
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, "Damn, no way"
Translate, español: "No way, José"
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gon' come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
[Bridge]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends
[Outro]

Title: God Is
Release Date: October 25, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-god-is-lyrics
Song Description: God Is is a soulful explanation of what the Lord is to Kanye and the many forms He and His gifts take in his life, explaining that God has helped free himself from his past demons and open up his life and his future to a new journey of faith.

The track first appeared on the first JESUS IS KING track listing teased by Kim Kardashian on August 29, 2019. When the track didnt appear on the second track list teaser from Kardashian on September 27, 2019, fans thought it had been cut from the record. However, Kanye previewed a part of the song during his Sunday Service session in Salt Lake City, Utah on October 6, 2019, where the choir performed the speculated chorus.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
God is
My light in darkness, oh
God, God is
He, He is my all and all (And I'll never turn back)
God is

[Verse]
Everything that hath breath praise the Lord
Worship Christ with the best of your portions
I know I won't forget all He's done
He's the strength in this race that I run
Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
And it shows just how much He is miraculous
I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be still
Everybody, I will tell 'til the whole world is healed
King of Kings, Lord of Lords, all the things He has in store
From the rich to the poor, all are welcome through the door
You won't ever be the same when you call on Jesus' name
Listen to the words I'm sayin', Jesus saved me, now I'm sane
And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup
I know God is alive, yeah
He has opened up my vision
Giving me a revelation
This ain't 'bout a dead religion
Jesus brought a revolution
All the captives are forgiven
Time to break down all the prisons
Every man, every woman
There is freedom from addiction
Jesus, You have my soul
Sunday Service on a roll
All my idols, let 'em go
All the demons, let 'em know
This a mission, not a show
This is my eternal soul
This my kids, this the crib
This my wife, this my life
This my God-given right
Thank You, Jesus, won the fight

Title: Hell of a Life
Release Date: November 22, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-hell-of-a-life-lyrics
Song Description: With the thematic of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy centered around pros and cons of fame, Hell of a Life is the culminating ode to the corrupt use of it to have a one-night stay with a porn star. A porn actress also represents the equivalent to a musical superstar in terms of visibility and openness to the public.

While talking about the making of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy with Complex, Nicki Minaj said Kanye really likes watching porn:

I go to the studio and he has nothing but pictures of naked women on his computer that hed invite me to look at. They were really artsy pictures, but you know he loves nudity, so it was a complete shock to me, cause I thought I had him all figured out, but I didnt. He was watching porn when we were in the studiono shame in his game.

An interesting aspect of this song is that despite the title, you never once hear Kanye say the f in Life, making it sound like Hell of a Lie for the entirety of the song. This could mean that Kanye deems the famous lifestyle as a lie to those who arent in it and are dreaming of it. The missing f sound is prominent in the meaning of these lines:

I think I fell in love with a pornstar
And got married in the bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
Thats one hell of a life

This tells us his fantasies with a pornstar were all an illusion.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I think I just fell in love with a pornstar
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what?
We headed to hell for Heaven's sakes, huh
Well, I'ma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah
[Chorus]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life

[Verse 2]
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin' from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing
Well, I guess a lotta niggas do gangbang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
You might also like[Chorus]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life

[Verse 3]
One day, I'm gon' marry a pornstar
We'll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna roleplay 'til I roll over
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day?
'specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, "Get away"
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on

[Bridge]
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights on
With the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck, fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the, with the lights on
[Chorus]
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life

[Outro]
I think I fell in love with a pornstar
And got married in the bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a life
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)

Title: Freestyle 4
Release Date: February 14, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-freestyle-4-lyrics
Song Description: Freestyle 4 represents a libido-driven, intoxicated Kanye, who raps about the fast life and wilding out at fancy dinners. The title itself is representative of the communication he is having with his own mind. He describes being out of control, and throughout the verse he highlights his drug abuse, thus causing a distorted reality, much like the feedback of an amplifier.

The string sample from Goldfrapps Human adds a very thin harmony and is combined with the call and response of the verse and an instrumental woop sound. The woop sound is reminscent of the woop sound in All of The Lights, which producer Mike Dean also worked on.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Kanye West]

Title: Feedback
Release Date: February 14, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-feedback-lyrics
Song Description: Feedback is Kanyes unapologetic ode to success. After nearly 3 years since the release of Yeezus, the Chicago-bred rapper joyfully announces his return to the rap arena.  He flaunts his money, trashes his haters, and reps his humble beginnings.

In the second verse, Kanye draws comparisons to Pablo Escobar. A reference to the T.L.O.P tracklist notepad which had the words which one scribbled near the title, implying Kanye was drawing inspiration from more than one famous Pablo.

The song originally leaked online through a low quality video recording of a DJ Windows 98 (better known as Win Butler of Arcade Fire) set in Montreal on May 28th, 2015. The track then resurfaced on February 11th, 2016 as Good News before Yeezy Season 3 started, but later that day, when the song played at Kanyes fashion show and album premiere at Madison Square Garden, it became clear that A Long Time a.k.a. Good News was actually indeed the mysterious Feedback.

The opening sounds mimic dissonant microphone feedback.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We 'bout to get this paper

[Verse 1]
Money never made me
Make me do something? Nah, can't make me
Even if the money low, can't pay me
Even if the money low, can't play me

[Chorus]
Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We 'bout to get this paper

[Verse 2]
Pablo bought a Rolie and a rottweiler
Seem like the more fame, I only got wilder
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
I've been outta my mind a long time
I've been outta my mind a long time
I be saying how I feel at the wrong time

[Verse 4]
I've been outta my mind a long time
I've been outta my mind a long time
I know, I know, I shouldn't even bother
With all these gossiping, no-pussy-getting bloggers
Fashion show in Gotham, I need another costume
PETA mad 'cause I made a jacket outta possum
Awesome, Steve Jobs mixed with Steve Austin
Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton
If Hov J then every Jordan need a Rodman
Man, Jay, they don't really want no problems
Driving in the same car that they killed Pac in
Driving in the same urr that they killed Pac in
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
Hands up, hands up, then the cops shot us
[Outro]
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Wait a second, everybody here, I'm the ghetto Oprah
You know what that mean? You get a fur! You get a fur!
You get a jet! You get a jet! Big booty bitch for you! Woo!

Title: Diamonds from Sierra Leone
Release Date: May 31, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-diamonds-from-sierra-leone-lyrics
Song Description: This was Late Registrations lead single, and it was technically a bonus track on the album.

Jay-Z would later jump on the track for the remix.

West explained the inspiration for the song to MTV:

Mark Romanek, the director that did Jays 99 Problems, and Q-Tip both brought up blood diamonds. They said, Thats what I think about when I hear diamonds. I think about kids getting killed, getting amputated in West Africa. And Q-Tips like, Sierra Leone, and Im like, Where? And I remember him spelling it out for me and me looking on the Internet and finding out more. I think that was just one of those situations where I just set out to entertain, but every now and then God taps me on the shoulder and says, Yo, I want you to do this right here, so hell place angels in my path and one angel will lead to another angel and its like a treasure hunt or something. And I finally found the gold mine, which was the video Diamonds (From Sierra Leone).

[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
"Does he write his own rhymes?" Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
"Damn, is he really that caught up?"
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name "Porsche" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is "Minivan"
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—

Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say "Kayne"
Got family in the D, kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, "Pssh, we messed up."
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like "Amen"
But r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Outro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)

Title: Hey Mama
Release Date: August 30, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-hey-mama-lyrics
Song Description: This song is a ballad dedicated to Kanye Wests mom Donda West and was written in 2000. It later appeared in its final version on Kanyes 2005 album Late Registration.

West debuted the song on Oprah with his mother in the audience. Donda liked it so much she actually made it her ringtone at the time.

Sadly, Donda passed away in 2007 of cosmetic surgery complications, and Kanye understandably broke down in tears attempting to perform this song at his next concert, but not before he had the opportunity to perform the song live for her in their kitchen in Chicago.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZlaxHQPu_8

On the 10th anniversary of Donda Wests passing on November 10, 2017, a group of Kanye fans organized an event titled Hey Mama Day. The event aims to encourage fans to listen to the song with the hope of it reappearing on the Billboard Hot 100. Its motivations were also to combat the release of Taylor Swifts album Reputation on the anniversary, which many percieved as an intentional move in the long-standing Swift-West feud.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you, and uh
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey, Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you, I'm goin' back to school, and
I appreciate what you allowed for me, and I
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey, Mama)

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine, I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi'
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said, "Mommy, I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford"
See, you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what Heaven do
Sent us an angel, and I thank you, Mama

I appreciate what you allowed for me, and I
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey, Mama)

[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, "Life is like a box of chocolates"
My mama told me, "Go to school, get your doctorate
Something to fall back on, you could profit with"
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of "You Are So Beautiful To Me"?
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni
Turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on, Mommy, just dance wit' me
Let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say "Hey," y'all say, "Mama"
Now everybody answer me, come on
[Chorus]
(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey, Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you, I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey, Mama)

[Break]
I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second they get up, you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let your friends know (Hey, Mama)
Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag', whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say

[Outro]
(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you, and uh
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey, Mama)
You know I love you so, and
I never let you go
Wrote this song just so you know
No matter where you go, our love is true
(Hey, Mama)

Title: Ok Ok
Release Date: August 29, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-ok-ok-lyrics
Song Description: Teaming up with fellow Chicago native Rooga, Brooklyn rapper Fivio Foreign, and Atlanta rapper Lil Yachty, the quartet reflects on how they have personally felt betrayed and/or demonized by the media and the music industry, as well as how they all have to deal with people that are simply around to take advantage of their situations.

The song, which marks the first officially released collaboration between Yachty and Kanye, despite the pair having recorded music together in 2016 during the sessions for Kanyes scrapped album TurboGrafx16, was debuted during the second listening event for Kanyes tenth studio album, Donda, which happened on August 5, 2021, and was held at Mercedes Benz Stadium in Yachtys hometown of Atlanta, Georgia.

Notably, Rooga worked extensively with Kanye during the recording process of Donda, with a reference track by Rooga for Kanyes song Jesus Lord, which was played at the second listening event for the album, and was leaked in early 2021.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Fivio Foreign]
Okay, now they got me, wanna rap again
Heal the wound and then you stab me in my back again (Uh)
You the type to play the joke and try to hide your hand (Uh)
Not the type to come around and try to play your friend (Bomb)
You the type to cut the grass and snake your bestest man
I'm the type to close the deal and cut my **** in
See me in person, I look like a ghost (Grr)
See me in person, I look like a ghost (Bow)
You wanna come in and play with the G.O.A.T (Bow)
You wanna come in and play with the G.O.A.T (God body)
All you rap **** sound like me, can't tell who is who
You got no real identity, can't tell you from you
Price went up (Yeah), angel investor (Yeah)
Price went up (Uh), angel investor (Yeah)

[Chorus: Kanye West & Fivio Foreign]
Okay, okay, I'm not okay
Think they're good, it's not okay
Okay, okay, not okay (Uh)
Think they’re good, get out the way (Uh)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Who said I did what? What did they do?
Why the hell you hatin' so damn hard? Someone must pay you
They don't keep me 'round 'cause I'm straight truth
My dawg locked up, had more home runs than Babe Ruth (Boom)
Had them chickens cleanin' my house, I told them, "Be of use" (Brr)
If I see disloyalty, then we gon' cut 'em loose (Yeah)
Havin' my hands 'round her neck, grip tight like a noose (Hee)
Tell you a story with a bad ending 'cause I'm not a Seuss (Yeah, bih')
Passin' 'round **** to the thugs for an immunity boost (Go)
Double cup filled to the top with the serenity juice (Yessir)
Moment of silence, R.I.P to Juice (Yeah, hey)
If they say it's up, it's up, I don't need a truce (Damn)
Everything I do is solely for the broken youth (Sheesh, yes)
I just took her over the mountain with my index (Wow)
She told me to go to Hell like I ain't been yet (Yuh)
And I still put in overtime like I ain't win yet

You can hear the pain 'cause I put my heart in it, yeah
Most of these **** ain't real, they don't wanna see me winnin', no

Title: Champion
Release Date: September 11, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-champion-lyrics
Song Description: An anthem from Kanye Wests album Graduation containing a jazz and reggae influence, eschewing trumpets in favor of bright synthesizers and featuring breezy hooks provided by a chopped-up vocal sample of Kid Charlemagne by Steely Dan.
Lyrics:

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Yes, I did
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' something, show ya how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted layaway or a deposit
My dad'd say, "When you see clothes, close your eyelids"
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school wit' a new wardrobe, but ayy

Did you realize
Ayy, ayy, ayy
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Chorus: Kanye West]

When he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin', show ya how we live
Everything I wanted, man, it seem so serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When it feel like living's harder than dyin'
For me, givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to? Huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week, I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll cleaned up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now, they know they invincible
[Refrain: Kanye West]
Did you realize
Ayy, ayy, ayy
That you were a champion in their eyes?
[Bridge: Connie Mitchell]
This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one
This is the story of a champion
Runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one

[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Yes, I did
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib

Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
Like this
[Refrain]
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Title: Junya
Release Date: August 29, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-junya-lyrics
Song Description: Junya is a tribute to elusive Japanese fashion designer Junya Watanabe.

Watanabe, a protg of Comme des Garons designer Rei Kawakubo, is best known for his work with CDG as well as his own eponymous clothing brand.

The song features Kanyes Go2DaMoon collaborator Playboi Carti, marking the duos second collaboration. This track is one of two collaborations with Carti on Donda, the other being Off the Grid.

Title: Pure Souls
Release Date: August 29, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-pure-souls-lyrics
Song Description: Pure Souls is the first ever collaboration between Kanye West and Roddy Ricch.

The collab came as a shock to some fans, as the duo had a minor spat on social media after Ye posted a video of himself urinating on one of his Grammy Awards.

https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1306280073209589760?s=20

Roddy Ricch took to Instagram Live to speak out against Kanyes tweet, describing it as lame.

Regardless of prior beef, the duo link up for a profound song that references the challenges that they have faced since reaching high levels of success. They spit about avoiding the temptation to sell their souls to fame and fortune.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Roddy Ricch & Kanye West]
Life change when you famous
I remember, back before the chains, we was nameless
Went through stages just to hop on new stages
Open up your eyes, man, they only entertainers
And I cannot sell my soul (Soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Yeah, soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Jesus saved my soul)
And I cannot sell my soul

[Verse 1: Roddy Ricch, Kanye West & both]
I've been at the top shinin' like a light pole
And I'm just a product of whatever I was raised in
This money sanctified, so I gotta say it again
They said I was mad at the Grammys
But I'm lookin' at my Grammy right now
Pulled up on Ye, and I said, "They don't understand me"
I just want my dawg to pipe down
'Cause when you really came from the trenches
You was raised in the trenches (Mm)
You feel like you trailblazed for the trenches (Mm)
I hope God can forgive me for the days that I was sinnin' (Mhm)

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch & Kanye West]
The truth is only what you get away with, huh?
(Man, all these lyin' ****)
I said the truth is only what you get away with, huh?
Ayy, that's why a lot of these **** be fakin', huh
Made it through the trials and tribulations, huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh, uh, well, well, here goes
Well, here goes, but here goes
I was one of them weirdos of the pure soul
That would go to the flea market to buy fake clothes
Every color Girbauds, every Cutlass is cold
Every cousin that stole, every summer was cold
Out of all of the Moes, out of all of the Folks
After all of the jokes, I'm the one that was chose
All of my friends love to gangbang
How we in my car and you say we ain't in the same lane?
When we both had Pelles on
And we was scammin' for the prom before Chief Keef was "Bang, Bang"
Always had mob ties
Stood on my six points, how could I not rise?
Love, truth, peace, freedom, justice, but I'm not five
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
And for all the guys that went to the White House and said, "Free the old man"
Every day I put my life on the line to feed the whole clan
Personal worth is not what a person is worth
I can give a dollar to every person on Earth
Man, it's gotta be God's plan
Man, I swear these boys keep playin'
We gon' have to square up then
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then, uh
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then
My favorite place to send it
[Bridge: Kanye West]
It ain't how it used to be
This the new me, so get used to me
It ain't how it used to be
This the new me, so get used to me
Lookin' in the mirror, it's the truth of me
Lookin' at my kids, it's the proof of me
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free
Father, Holy Spirit, let loose on me
Father, I'm Yours exclusively
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free
Father, Holy Spirit, let loose on me
Father, I'm Yours exclusively
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free

The truth is only what you get away with, huh
I said the truth is only what you get away with, huh?
Ayy, that's why a lot of these **** be fakin', huh
Made it through the trials and tribulations, huh

Title: Heard ’Em Say
Release Date: August 30, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-heard-em-say-lyrics
Song Description: Heard Em Say was released as the third single from Late Registration. The single achieved gold status while peaking at #26 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #12 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. Kanye reflects on the harsh realities in life and how things happen for a reason.

This song samples Someone That I Used to Love by Natalie Cole. Adam Levines lyrics would be later used in Maroon 5s song Nothing Lasts Forever.

As to how the collaboration came about,
Adam told Montreality,

We were on a flight to the EMAs in Italy, at the time, he was on the same plane. I dont think we had met him yet. We were literally sitting there and he came up to me with his iPod or whatever it was at the time. He was like, Yo, man. How are you doing? Im Kanye. He was just getting big too. And he played me this record. Like, Hey, Ive got this record. Do you want to write a song together? On a plane. You know? And I said, Yeah, sure. And that was it. The next thing I knew we were in the studio making the record and it was that easy.
Lyrics:

[Produced by Kanye West and Jon Brion]

[Intro]
West—Mr. West—Mr. West
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
From the Chi, like Tim, it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
The things we seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars—I know it
[Chorus: Kanye West & Adam Levine]
Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh)
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing lasts forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran' keep praying and keep believing

The Devil is alive, I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

Ugh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh)

Lyrics:

[Produced by Kanye West]

[Chorus]
Damn
Here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn (Here we go)
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I'll never be picture-perfect, Beyoncé
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet? He was black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up? You see how I played a big
Role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'll never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

Everything I'm not made me everything I am
[Verse 2]
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearin' up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows?
So, say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please Award
But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award

[Chorus]
Damn
Here we go again
Bum-tu-bum-bum-bum
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
(Here we go) Damn
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
[Verse 3]
I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough, Mr. West, please, no more today

[Chorus]
(Here we go!) Damn
Here we go again
Everybody sayin' what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am

Title: No Child Left Behind
Release Date: August 29, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-no-child-left-behind-lyrics
Song Description: No Child Left Behind marks the first official snippet released by Kanye West for his highly anticipated tenth album, DONDA. It was originally previewed in a Beats commercial  starring American track star Sha'Carri Richardson.

The commercial also confirmed the July 23 release date of DONDA, which was highly speculated following a private listening party on July 18 in Las Vegas. However, the album was ultimately delayed.

The song title is a reference to an education bill of the same name, signed by the then American President George W. Bush in 2002 and later on repealed by following President Barack Obama. The title may also be a theme of Christianity, meaning that no child of God gets left behind.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Vory]
No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behind

[Verse: Vory]
Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y'all, never count on y'all
I'll always count on God
Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y'all, never count on y'all
I'll always count on God

[Chorus: Kanye West]

Title: Donda
Release Date: August 29, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-donda-lyrics
Song Description: Donda is the title-track of Kanye Wests tenth studio album Donda, and it serves as more of an interlude on the record, allowing room for Kanyes late mother Donda West to continue her talkings about Kanye following the intense Heaven and Hell. The song features The World Famous Tony Williams, who does the chorus, and Stalone, who helps with the intro and the background vocals.

The track was played at multiple public listening parties for the album, which happened in Las Vegas and Atlanta. The major difference between the live songs version and one released on the album is that a verse featuring Pusha T trading bars with Kanye was removed. The verse was based off of a reference track Pusha had recorded for Kanye, but the words were edited to sound like a conversation.

Even though this song is titled Donda, another track of the same name was recorded and intended to be on the original version of the album.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Kanye West with Stalone]
Forever, yeah
Can you hear me? Yeah
Forever, yeah
Forever, forever, no
Oh yeah, glory, glory, glory
Glory, glory, glory, glory

[Spoken Word: Donda West, Kanye West, Kanye West & Stalone]
It feels good to be home
And to all of you, I thank you so much for your support
For your support of me for so many years
And more importantly, for the work you continue to do
What do you want me to talk about?
Well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous
He told me I could talk about anything I wanted to
And you know, I am my son's mother
The man I describe in the introduction as being so decidedly different
My son (When you're runnin' outta timе and you're not outta time)
And what made thе project extra special to me is
I got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me
But what he has meant to a generation (Change the time)
As one writer said, we came from somewhere
Not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers
But from a long line of generations who came before us

Song Description: Kanye enlists the help of friends and frequent collaborators GLC and Consequence to discuss the plight of the black man in the ghettos of Chicago. Ye also discusses his work as a ghostwriter, explaining the lack of recognition he encountered, and how his demo tapes would get rejected  at the time, he was thought of more as a producer/writer than a rapper.

Lyrics:

[Produced by Kanye West]
[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit (Yeah, yeah)
I wish I could (Me too)
Buy me a spaceship and fly (I swear I do)
Past the sky, oh
GLC feel you, baby—I feel you, man
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky (Man, man, man...)
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then, I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check—wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah, I stole—never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Asking me about some khakis
But let some Black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh, now they love Kanye
"Let's put him all in the front of the store"
So I'm on break
Next to the "No Smoking" sign with a blunt in the mall
Taking my hits, writing my hits
Writing my rhymes, playing my mind
This fucking job can't help him
So I quit; y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love, dude
Lock yourself in a room
Doing five beats a day for three summers
That's A Different World like Cree Summer's
I deserve to do these numbers
"The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!"
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow!

And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob at the same time (Woo)
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind
Lost my mama, lost my mind (Aww)
Life, my love, that's not mine

Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only wanna ball, never wanna fall (Ugh)
Gotta get mine, gotta take mine (Ugh)
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime (Ugh)
Gotta make these haters respect mine (Yeah)
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule had said 9
Putting them pants on shelves
Waiting patiently; I ask myself
Where I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holler at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sounds so sweet
Yes, I'm the same ol' G
Same goatee, stayin' low-key, nope
Holler at God: "Man, why'd you have to take my folks?"
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G, police watch me
Smoke my weed and count my Gs
Got a lot of people counting on me (That's right)
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace (That's right)
Should've finished school like my niece
Then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow!
[Chorus: Kanye West, GLC, & Kanye w/ Choir]
I've been working this grave-shift
Aww, man, this pressure
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky, oh
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 3: Consequence]
I 'member having to take the dollar cab
Coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day
Tryna make this thing right
And havin' one of my coworkers say, "Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night"
Well, easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
That all had got snatched from me, A&Rs and they faculties
All turn their back on me and didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally, actually, had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe, empty fridge is staring back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off, bow!
[Chorus: Kanye West & Kanye w/ Choir]
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky, oh
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky
Oh, oh, oh

[Outro: Tony Williams]
I wanna fly
I wanna fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take a brother for a ride
(Heaven knows, heaven knows)

Title: Keep My Spirit Alive
Release Date: August 29, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-keep-my-spirit-alive-lyrics
Song Description: Keep My Spirit Alive recruits Westside Gunn and Conway The Machine (AKA Hall N Nash) of Griselda Records, and features a small cameo in the third verse by Royce da 5'9". This cut is about each rapper reflecting on their pasts and keeping their faith in God intact through their best and worst. This song was first made public through the Las Vegas listening party of DONDA that occurred on July 18th, 2021.  The official version of Conways verse is noticeably shorter than Gunns and Kanyes.

The original release of the song featured KayCyy on the chorus. He was removed from the song (except his opening ooh) upon Dondas 28 September 2021 update and replaced with Wests vocals singing a slightly changed chorus (along with Chris Brown on New Again). Unlike Brown, the reasoning for this is unknown. KayCyy retains a writing credit (Browns credit is struck from the record).

On the deluxe version of Donda, KayCyys version of the chorus was added back in Keep My Spirit Alive pt 2.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Kanye West & KayCyy]

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Yo

Hundred-round drum didn't jam when my shooter tried to spray it, thank God (Thank God)
Couple thousand grams, got two thousand grands when we waited, thank God (Thank God)
I was facin' fifteen and I beat it (And I beat it)
Just spent about twenty up at Neimans (Up at Neimans)
Did two hundred in a Demon (In a Demon, skrrt)
I'm the illest **** and I mean it (And I mean it)
My homie droppin' bodies for no reason (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)

Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don't do commercials, 'cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you
She said "You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you"
How I'm forty-two and you got a curfew?
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?
Quiet all the cordialness
We walk in God's spiritual ordinance
We know the Blacks, the orphans refused to be runaways
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid

You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

Title: On God
Release Date: October 25, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-god-lyrics
Song Description: On God is an uptempo track from Kanye West that features production from Pi'erre Bourne, marking the third collaboration between the two, following Travis Scotts May 2018 track, Watch and Kanyes June 2018 track, Yikes.

The track continues the spiritual themes of the album and features Kanye preaching the message of the Bible. In particular, Kanye addresses his controversial comments on the thirteenth amendment and calls out the Grammys' system, while also name dropping  Chief Keef.

The title is also a nod to the expression on god  a common phrase in hip hop  which means something like believe me or swear on my life.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yo, Pi'erre, yo, Pi'erre

[Verse]
"How you get so much favor on your side?"
"Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour," I replied
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, not divide
I'ma ride, that's on God
His light shine the brightest in the dark
Single mothers know they got my heart
And all my brothers locked up on the yard
You can still be anything you wanna be
Went from one in four to one in three
Thirteenth amendment, gotta end it, that's on me
He the new commander and the chief
That's on Keef, that's on God
Before the ranch, I had horses in the garage
When the Forbes cover was just a mirage
They had me chasin' statues, that's on pride
"Oh my God," Bust said that's on Tribe
When I thought the Book of Job was a job
The Devil had my soul, I can't lie
Life gon' have some lows and some highs
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod
I wore my heart on my sleeve, I couldn't hide
In '03, they told me not to drive
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died
But I survived, that's on God
I've been tellin' y'all since '05
The greatest artist restin' or alive
That's on L.A. Reid, that's on Clive
That's no Jive, that's on God
Off the 350s He supplied
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe
Man, that's over half of the pie
I felt dry, that's on God
That's why I charge the prices that I charge
I can't be out here dancin' with the stars
No, I cannot let my family starve
I go hard, that's on God

Song Description: Use This Gospel is a spiritual track from Kanye West and rap group Clipsea former duo that was comprised of Pusha T and No Malicewhich is centered around asking God for forgiveness and showing gratitude for his many blessings.

This track is an updated version of the scrapped Yandhi track, Law of Attraction.

This track marks the first joint effort between No Malice and Pusha T since No Malices August 2013 track Shame the Devil.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Use this gospel for protection
It's a hard road to Heaven
We call on Your blessings
In the Father, we put our faith
King of the kingdom
Our demons are tremblin'
Holy angels defendin'
In the Father, we put our faith

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
How could He not be the greatest?
In my bed, under covers when undercovers had raided
My presence is happy belated
Fashionably late, I'm just glad that you made it
The best is yet to come, I'm just glad that you waited
They all say they real 'til it's time to appraise it
I seen them come and go, you only the latest
But who am I to judge? I'm crooked as Vegas

[Verse 2: No Malice]
A lot of damaged souls, I done damaged those
And in my arrogance, took a camera pose
Caught with a trunk of Barry Manilows
They sing a different tune when the slammer close
From the concrete grew a rose
They give you Wraith talk, I give you faith talk
Blindfolded on this road, watch me faith walk
Just hold on to your brother when his faith lost

Title: The New Workout Plan
Release Date: August 31, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-the-new-workout-plan-lyrics
Song Description: This song speaks to all of the pressure put on women by men. This song is a satire of workout mixtapes  its upbeat and has steady rhythm, making it excellent to exercise to. The song doesnt actually give much in the way of workout advice, though, other than recommending sit-ups and crunches.

Kanye talks about how women are only valued for their bodies, and work out in an effort to pull a rapper, an NBA player, man, at least a dude with a car. The rapid nature of the song puts the listener in the frantic mind of a woman jumping through hoops as it were to please and attract men.

In an interview with Mikkey Halsted, he revealed how at one point Kanye reportedly wanted this to be his first single:

Hed play me a lot of his tracks and share his ideas, like how he wanted Workout Plan to be his first single, and I told him not to do it.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
You just popped in the Kanye West
Get Right for the Summer workout tape
And ladies, if you follow these instructions exactly
You might be able to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude with a car!
So, first of all, we gonna work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass

[Verse 1]
One, and two, and three, and four, and get them sit ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son, don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh, she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
(Ah!) What's scary to me
Henny make girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me, miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking 'bout freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

Lyrics:

[Intro: Lauryn Hill]
Yo, yo (Check our situation)
My men and my women
(Yo) Yo, yo (Check our situation)
My men and my wom–

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You need somethin' unexpected, some form of weapon
You ask him to feel protected, and still feel protected
Just one time for the record, just one time for the record
Don't agree with the message, don't agree with the methods

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, it's too early
What the hell you doin' wakin' me up at 5:30?
Why the hell are you worried?
Play somethin' that is very, very vibe-worthy
I don't know want my mind alerting
People sayin' tweetin' gonna make you die early
How 'bout have my heart hurtin'?
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early
Go on and get your best attorney
Something's there, feel it when I heard it
Just release the spirit, let it flow though
How these **** leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo?
Nail me to the cross with long nails, like Coko
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo
I ain't got my point across
'Til we finally get across and pass the point
So there's a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know
I ain't never question what you was askin' for
I gave you every single thing you was askin' for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off
I be goin' through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad'll know
Too many family secrets, somebody passin' notes
Things I cried about, I found laughable
Lil' baby Jesus, ain't laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain't laughin', no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know

One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow in love
One last sparkle to follow in my light

[Interlude: Buju Banton]
Okay, I didn't throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
I told you I loved you, but you didn't believe
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived
By some dude who's more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha
You said that I lie, how did I? I told you everything, didn't I?
But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we're in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha
I'm laughin' at you all, you think you got me? No, no
My back ain't against the wall (The wall, the wall, the wall, the wall, the wall)

Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love

Title: We Don’t Care
Release Date: February 10, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-we-dont-care-lyrics
Song Description: In response to a request to sing a song for the kids in The College Dropouts Intro, Kanye gets the kids to sing a song to celebrate dealing drugs out of desperation. In fact, according to Complex, West originally titled the song Drug Dealing.

This serves as a great opener for the albums theme of not caring about societal norms on things such as education, drug dealing, music, etc.

Dont let society tell you, This is what you have to do.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Kanye West]
Oh, yeah
I got the perfect song for the kids to sing
And all my people that's—

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say" (Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer, they ain't finna say, "Next summer, I'm finna..."
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin', man, your ass is grown

Throw your hands up in the sky and say

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas—
[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by (Yeah)
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive (Alive)
Throw your hands up in the sky and say (Uh-huh, yeah)
"We don't care what people say" (Yeah, yeah, ugh)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song "12 Questions"
We scream: "Rocks, blow, weed, park," see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
You tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromey wheels here
You tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—
[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

Title: Come to Life
Release Date: August 29, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-come-to-life-lyrics
Song Description: On Come to Life, Kanye sings about his desire for another life, wishing he had listened more to his ex-wife Kim Kardashians thoughts, dreams, problems, and aspirations. He shares his mixed emotions about her presence and absence, expressing how he does not want to die alone without her at his side. He sings about the silver-lining, which he latches on to during his darkest nights, which are his children. He treats his children as one of the most important things in his life and the one thing holding him together amid the divorce.

This song was debuted during the finale of the third and final Donda Listening Party, held in Kanyes hometown of Chicago, in which he was set on fire inside of a replica of his childhood home. He then reenacted his wedding to Kardashian, which could be interpreted as Kanye burning his past and bringing forth the life he has always wanted with Kardashian.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Don't you wish the night would go numb?
I've been feelin' low for so long
I ain't had a high in so long

Night is always darkest 'fore the dawn
Gotta make my mark 'fore I'm gone
I don't wanna die alone
I don't wanna die alone
I get mad when she gone
Mad when she home
Sad when she gone
Mad when she home
Sad when she gone (Loosen right now, the spirit that wants to run)
Floatin' on a silver lining (In the name of Jesus)
Yeah, you know where to find me, ridin' on a silver lining
And my God won't deny me, tell the Devil, "Get behind me"
And all the stars are aligned, lift me up every time

Took your thoughts and penciled 'em in
Should've wrote 'em down in pen
And maybe they'll come to life
And maybe they'll come to life
Sadness settin' in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned
Uncle right back to the pen'
Tell me how auntie been
Thoughts, you had penciled 'em in
Probably should've wrote 'em in pen
And maybe they'll come to life
They could finally come to life
They could finally come to life
[Verse 2]
You know where to find me, they cannot define me
So they crucify me, how so fazed when I leave?
Come and purify me, come and sanctify me
You the air that I breathe, the ultra-ultralight beam
Brought a gift to Northie, all she want was Nikes
This is not about me, God is still alive, so I'm free
Floatin' on a silver lining, floatin' on a silver lining
So when I'm free, I'm free79Embed

Title: Family Business
Release Date: February 10, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-family-business-lyrics
Song Description: The stories in this song are not actually all about Kanyes family. Per Complex, Tarrey Torae (who sings they dont mean a thang toward the end) helped Kanye with the stories for this song.

Kanye was like, I need this to be about real-life family, recalled Tarrey. "Im the oldest of 48 grandkids on my moms side and Im in the middle of 36 grandkids on my fathers side. So when he said, I need material. I was like, I got plenty of material. Tarrey went on to tell Kanye about taking baths with her cousins, sleeping six in a bed, and her auntie who was known for her bad cooking. In fact, at the end when Kanye says Lets get Stevie out of jail, hes actually referring to Tarreys godbrother.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
How's your son?
(All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
He made the team this year?
Aight, they said he wasn't tall enough
(All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
Ma', we here, we gon' cook this Sunday, okay? So come by
Damn, that's your new girlfriend?

[Verse 1]
This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet, like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone, it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yo, you heard the track I did, man? "This Can't Be Life"
Somebody please say grace, so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it, why the guard had to look all through it?
As kids, we used to laugh, who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it, then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

And I don't care about (All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring)
They don't mean a thing
(All, all, all, tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight in gold
(All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
Now, all I know, I know all these things

[Verse 2]
Yeah, this is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abi, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like, "See! That's my cousin on TV!"
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And they gon' hate it, and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together, be Electric Slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw, naw, don't open the photobook up
I got a Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday, nobody eating her food
And you don't wanna stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at they crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousin
Fit three in the bed if it's six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
[Bridge]
Rain, rain, rain, go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say (Uh)
Rain, rain, rain, go away (Yeah)
Let the sun come out and all the children say (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using nines and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi' is my family, dawg
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family, dawg
I feel like, one day, you'll understand me, dawg
You can still love your man and be manly, dawg
You ain't gotta get heated at every housewarmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Sheila always performin'?
Second she storm out, then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't letting everybody in our family business, uh

[Chorus]
(All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring)
They don't mean a thing
(All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
They don't mean a thing
(All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
They don't mean a thing, a thing
And I don't care about (Woo! All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring)
They don't mean a thing (All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight in gold (All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
And all I know, I know all these things

All these things

Title: Ye vs. the People (starring TI as the People)
Release Date: April 27, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-ye-vs-the-people-starring-ti-as-the-people-lyrics
Song Description: Ye vs. the People was premiered on Power 106 on April 27th, 2018. The song consists of one long back-and-forth verse, featuring T.I., who plays the role of The People. The track was most likely inspired by T.I.s T.I. vs. T.I.P., which, like Ye vs. The People, consisted of a single verse, alternating between the two characters.

The song premiered just hours after the release of Lift Yourself, a troll-ish song that Ye released to bring closure to HOT 97s Ebro Darden, following their on-air phone call and text conversation regarding Yes support for Donald Trump and other right-wing pundits.

The title may have been inspired by the FX show, American Crime Story: The People Vs. O.J. Simpson. Kanye has repeatedly referred to the infamous case on songs such as On Sight, Stronger and ScHoolboy Qs THat Part. In addition, in 2016 Ye was spotted wearing a Free O.J. shirt. It should also be noted that Kanyes wife, Kim Kardashian, is the daughter of Robert Kardashian, who was one of O.J.s defense attorneys in the case.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Four Tops]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust
I watch a phone that I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust

[Verse: Kanye West & T.I.]
I know Obama was heaven-sent
But ever since Trump won, it proved that I could be president
Yeah, you can, at what cost though?
Don't that go against the teachings that Ye taught for?
Yo, Tip, I hear your side and everybody talk though
But ain't goin' against the grain everything I fought for?
Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this?
It's some shit you just don't align with and don't go against
You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print
You on some choosin'-side shit, I'm on some unified shit
It's bigger than your selfish agenda
If your election ain't gon' stop police from murderin' niggas
Then shit…
Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people
Actually, wearin' the hat'll show people that we equal
You gotta see the vantage point of the people
What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil
See that's the problem with this damn nation
All Blacks gotta be Democrats, man
We ain't made it off the plantation
Fuck who you choose as your political party
You representin' dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted
With blatant disregard for the people who put you in position
Don't you feel an obligation to them?
I feel a obligation to show people new ideas
And if you wanna hear 'em, there go two right here
Make America Great Again had a negative perception
I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction
Added empathy, care and love and affection
And y'all simply questionin' my methods
What you willin' to lose for the point to be proved?
This shit is stubborn, selfish, bullheaded, even for you
You wore a dusty-ass hat to represent the same views
As white supremacy, man, we expect better from you
All them times you sounded crazy, we defended you, homie
Not just to be let down when we depend on you, homie
That's why it's important to know what direction you're goin' now
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down
You think I ain't concerned about how I affect the past?
I mean, that hat stayed in my closet like 'bout a year and a half
Then one day I was like, "Fuck it, I'ma do me."
I was in the sunken place and then I found the new me
Not worried about some image that I gotta keep up
Lot of people agree with me, but they're too scared to speak up
The greater good of the people is first
Have you considered all the damage and the people you hurt?
You had a bad idea and you're makin' it worse
This shit's just as bad as Catholic preachers rapin' in church
Y'all been leadin' with hate, see I just approach it different
Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand
I know everybody emotional
Is it better if I rap about crack? Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich?
You'll deal with God for the lack of respect
Startin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check
Now you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that
What's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit?
Okay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bigot
Yeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget
And all that free thought shit, find a better defense
But if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that
Fuck it

Alright, Tip, we could be rappin' about this all day, man
Why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?

Title: Gone
Release Date: August 30, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/Kanye-west-gone-lyrics
Song Description: In the closing track off 2005s Late Registration, Cam'ron, Consequence, and Kanye West himself deliver some of their best verses ever over a classic sample of Otis Reddings Its Too Late, accompanied by an orchestra arranged by co-producer Jon Brion.  Note the string progression throughout the song, particularly in verse 4, when Cons drops.

You can watch some of the orchestral recording sessions for Late Registration (including Gone) below: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImKfG8equzY

Interestingly, Gone debuted in Billboards Hot 100 chart in 2013: eight years after the release of Late Registration. The songs revival started when Marina Shifrin, a writer and comedian, quit her job as a video editor by creating a video for her boss in which she dances to Gone around her office. The video went viral.
Lyrics:

[Produced by Kanye West]

[Intro: Otis Redding and Kanye West]
Wished I had told ooh was (the) only one (uh oh)
But it's too late
It's too late
He's gone

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) Groupies say I'm too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Say she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way, gone!

[Hook 1: Kanye West and Cam'ron]
Gone
We striving home
Gone
I ride on chrome

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus, he already got three chil'r'n
Arguin' over babysitters like, "Bitch, it's your turn"
"Damn, Ye, it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official"
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap, now he at the top where dude belong
'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

Poof, be gone, damn, tough luck, dag (Dag)
Niggas still doing puff-puff-pass (Puff, pass)
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched-up Jag, shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell 'em too late
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine, stay, you got the grind, hey
Came back, read what the sign say (Too late, he's gone)
Yes, I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah, you church, boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain't even my size, see the greed in my eyes

That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?

[Verse 4: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his mama with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking "Cons, how long has this gone on?"
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning, he was gone with my bread
And with that being said, I had gone on my instincts
And goin' to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, 'cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone
[Break: Kanye West]
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me "Benz or Rover?"
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on, I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, "Sorry, Mr. West is gone"
