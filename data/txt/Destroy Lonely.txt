Artist: Destroy Lonely, Alternate Names: Young Gorgeous, Lil Gamo Belt, Tundra Boy Lone, Look Killa, Bobby Wardell Sandimanie III, Bobby Sandimanie III
Artist Description: Bobby Wardell Sandimanie III (born July 30, 2001), popularly known as Destroy Lonely, is an American recording artist from Atlanta, Georgia.

In an interview with Our Generation Music, the Atlanta native explained how the “Destroy” in his stage name came from his feeling that drugs were destroying him:

I had an era when I was like in high school where I was like doing drugs and shit. So, like I was on Xans and I used to be geeked the fuck up. I’d come to school, [at] seven o'clock in the morning just geeked up, like, “I don’t give a fuck about nothing, I’m on the Xans, I’m geeking.” But like, I knew I was likewise enough, I guess or just like I wanted better for myself, so I knew like if I kept doing that shit, I’d fuck myself up like in a way, on some corny shit, destroy myself, you know what I’m saying? Like self-destruction. So, I’m like, “I'ma just use that as the first part of my name.”

He further elaborated on how the “Lonely” part came to fruition as he felt lonely at his house while doing online school:

So, like then from that, when I was in school, I kinda like didn’t really like school, and I felt like I was out of place. I wasn’t fucking with school at all, so I told my grandma [and she] was fuckin' with it, so I went to online school. When I went to online school, I was by myself. This was [in middle school], so I went to sixth grade in public school, then I left public school and went to school on the computer. The whole time I’m in online school on the computer, I’m at the crib by myself and shit, and it’s like, it’s just weird. And I’m like, I feel like I’m lonely, you know what I’m saying? I really ain’t have no friends and shit.

The son of rapper I-20, Lonely grew up in a musical household and created music from a young age. His earliest official releases came in late 2015 on SoundCloud.

As he grew his fanbase and released more projects, Lonely forged relationships with many contemporaries in the Atlanta-area scene like BigSmokeChapo and Nezzus. He closely works with producer Clayco. He also frequently works with producers in Underworld Music Group, an artist and producer group created by Clayco.

Following the release of his mixtape ᐸ/3 (Broken Hearts) and the attention span of his breakout single, “Bane,” Lone was noticed by fellow Atlanta native Playboi Carti in December 2020 after the music video for his song “Oh Yeah”. In early 2021, Lonely signed to Carti’s record label and creative agency, Opium.

After getting signed to Opium, Lone has since started to get mainstream attention, with him appearing in festivals and collaborating with other artists. This would lead up to the release of his highly anticipated mixtape, NO STYLIST, released on August 12, 2022. The mixtape itself, as well as the single “NOSTYLIST,” would boost up Lone’s popularity across social media. He would follow up with a deluxe on November 18, 2022. Ending off the year, Lone would later get signed to Interscope Records.

Entering into 2023, Lone would release his biggest single to date, “if looks could kill,” to which it immediately gained attention through social media (primarily TikTok) prior to it’s release, after a snippet of the song was posted. On May 5, 2023, Lone would release his debut studio album, if looks could kill to commercial success. Lone would later release the Director’s Cut version of the album on September 29, 2023, consisting of six new tracks, four of which were imported from physical copies.

On August 30 2024, after keeping silent on releasing new music for some time, Lone would go onto release his sophomore studio album, LOVE LASTS FOREVER, to which it contain features from Lil Uzi Vert and Ken Carson, with Don Toliver being added onto the CD version. Lone would also release three deluxe versions of the album during the first week of it’s release.

Lone’s music consists of otherworldly, ominous instrumentals alongside his dark ambient voice delivery, doubling down on his mysterious persona.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Uh

[Chorus]
I been spending more on my safety
I been spending more to live safely
Thirty round all on the Glock and I'm reloading, ain't no safety
Every time I relocate, I'm going brazy
Roll up another one, I can't see shit, my vision hazy
Honestly, I don't even care, my nigga, fuck you, pay me
Every day I'm working hard and all these niggas lazy
The moon comin' up
I'm standing in my yard with a bankroll and my gun

[Verse 1]
I can't go nowhere without my cup and my blunt
They ask me if it's fuck them all, nah, I don't see no one
I don't shop at the mall, no, that's not where I spend my money
Buying designer clothes, shawty, I'm way too into stuntin'
She got a glimpse of my ice, so now she stunned
Yeah, she got a glimpse of my life, yeah, I have fun
Me and these niggas not alike, no, I get money
No, me and these niggas not alike, huh, they ain't nothin' (Yeah)
Only seen her twice then she say she love me
I gotta change my life, shawty, I gotta keep going (I gotta keep on going)
I'm on the next flight, on my way out of here
Nah, it's PJ every time, all my shit leer
Huh, I just skipped the line like a young nigga had Clear
I been told you l'm trying, thought I had made that clear, huh
'Bout my gang, I'm dying, let me make that clear
'Bout my chains, I'm dying, let me make that clear
I keep the FN on my side, let me make that clear
I been getting high for like the past six to seven years
Most of you niggas trash, and honestly, I been surpassing them
Most of these bitches trash, I hit 'em once and then I'm passing them
I been switched the swag up, 'boutta go rockstar, I go Aerosmith
I been switched the swag up, big ass pants, I go raver, nigga
I'm in Paris, France, fashion week, I walk a runway, nigga
Better not try it, you gon' die coming down that one way, nigga
Think she get too fly, I think I might put her in some new Margiela
These niggas think they fly, but honestly, I think I'm fresher

I could never fall off, I got all this money on deck
I been tryna shake them off, all these niggas on dick, pause
Tryna shake them off, all these bitches on dick, dawg
Every time I drip, got to take a pic', check my fit, shawty
Video vixen bitch, yeah, I got to hit pause
If they come my way with that shit, tell them folks we wasn't involved
And my neck and wrist done switched the seasons up, lil' bitch, it's fall
You would think I went to school for hooping, all I know is ball
I got a fashion addiction, every time I shop I want it all
Bitch, I ain't no lil' boy, I'm on the top floor making business calls
Never sorry, not at all
I'm pouring up promethazine, watching it dissolve
The way I keep on sipping lean, I'll be high 'til tomorrow
The way I keep on smoking weed, I can't even breathe at all

I been spending more on my safety

Uh, uh, huh

I'm with my gang, yeah, we having confetti, we throwing up brеad in Allure (In Allure)

[Verse 1]
I just dripped out my wholе damn gang
I put some whole new ice in my chain
I fucked her head up, now she insane
Put an SVI stamp on my rings
I sip drank, I don't sip Cîroc
I money dance, bitch, I don't pop-lock
I put all black on all my cars
I put all black clothes on my broads
I'm way too high, going way past Mars
Blonde-haired rockstar, yeah, Miley Cyrus
I gotta dip, think I hear sirens
I caught the blue hundred racks like a virus

Every time you look up at my diamonds

I done lost my mind, but I think I finally found it

She told me once that, yeah, she's mine, huh, and yеah, she's riding

I knew way back then when I started I was gonna go far (Far)
I rock a white tee just to get it dirty, real rockstar (Rockstar)
And my diamonds hang off my neck when I'm walking outside
Know I'm clutching my tech, shawty
Came a long way from not having shit, take a look at my wrist it's filled up with baguette, shawty
If a nigga thinkin' he gon' take this
He gon' die, I put that on my set, shawty
I put Rick Owens all on my vest, shawty

Put a upside down cross all on ya neck, shawty

A thousand miles away, I think about you
I'm so stuck in my head and I can't get out
Dug her hand in my chest, let her take it out
But I gotta stay focused, need another thousand

Damn, what this shit about?

Guess I gotta keep it real right now
Am I toxic? Probably
If I hurt you, just know that I'm sorry
Keep it real, I just need someone to ride with me
I play my role, but never games, no Atari
I'm in love with money and this muhfuckin' Margi
I keep it going, tell these niggas, "Don't start, please"
Get some money then these people start watching
And my music jingle like a muhfucking car key

Don't ask me 'bout shit 'cause I swear I don't know them guys
You can get what you want, lil' bitch, just gotta close your eyes

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Wagwan

[Chorus]
Wagwan, nigga, what goin'? (What goin'?)
My pants sagging, my gun showing
My money way more greener than lawns
I go bad boy, Martin Lawrence
I got a bad bitch, she a foreign
I'm up top nigga in New York
And my big bro just came from court
I got a stack full of all ones
I'm with some pretty hoes having fun
I'm an Italian, dripping in Milan
I only smoke 41, don't want no Runtz
I'm moving state to state, I'm on the run
That why I hate to face it, ain't a front
That's why I hate these niggas, they ain't nothing
That's why I hate these bitches, they ain't nothing

[Verse]
I'm getting paid, no, I can't be sad
Fucking this bitch and I'm breaking her back
Came through with a whole lot of cash
Came through with a whole lot of weed
To smoke on
And my diamonds stay getting freeze
They way too cold, they on snow cone
No, I'm not Quavo but, baby, I count up by thе hunchos
And I'm way too lit
If I pop out with this bitch, can't go through the front door
And she way too wet, whеn I hop up in this bitch, I need a poncho
I ain't even tryna talk if it ain't about money, I can't hear it
I ain't even tryna fuck with that lil' bitch if she ain't serious
CELINE, Chanel, when you ask for the fashion demon, it ring a bell
No, I'm not playing fair, I spent so much on this ring, I'm kind of embarrassed
I don't even like to do too much
My bitch, she do too much but I don't care
I'm sipping on codeine
Counting up money while this bitch do my hair

Title: Intercontinental
Release Date: November 15, 2022, URL: https://genius.com/Destroy-lonely-intercontinental-lyrics
Song Description: The song Intercontinental by Destroy Lonely appears to be a braggadocious anthem that celebrates material wealth, luxury, and a carefree lifestyle. The lyrics convey a sense of confidence and superiority as the artist boasts about their accomplishments and possessions.

The chorus suggests that if someone meets the artists standard of attractiveness (If the bitch bad), they will be treated with extravagance and thrown into the air, symbolizing a lavish lifestyle. The mention of Intercontinental implies a luxurious location or hotel, adding to the feeling of opulence.

Lines like Italian drip bitch Im not playing fair and Hear em talking bout Rick but I got every pair emphasize the artists expensive taste in fashion and accessories. They take pride in their collection and feel superior to those who cant afford the same items.

The verses continue the theme of extravagance, with references to expensive cars, designer brands, and excessive wealth. The lyrics also touch on the artists confidence, with lines like She know who I am, break her heart and shit and Bitch I go hard like Jeff Hardy.

Moreover, lines such as Yes I go special ed, like retarded kids reveals his ambitious tendencies to always try his hardest in whatever hes attempting, whether it be rapping or flexing his wealth. He isnt afraid of throwing around the word retarded like Ken Carson was in his song Hardcore.

Overall, Intercontinental portrays a persona of wealth, confidence, and a disregard for societal rules. It showcases the artists enjoyment of a lavish lifestyle and their desire to be recognized for their material success.
