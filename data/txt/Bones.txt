Artist: Bones, Alternate Names: Elmo O'Connor, Elmo Kennedy O'Connor, Th@ Kid
Artist Description: Elmo Kennedy O'Connor (born January 11th, 1994), mainly known as BONES (formerly Th@ Kid), is an American rapper from Muir Beach, CA. He is the owner of underground music collective TeamSESH and releases music under the aliases surrenderdorothy, OREGONTRAIL (with TeamSESH producer GREAF), and Ricky A Go Go.

During his childhood, he and his family moved to the small town of Howell, Michigan where he attended school. Eventually, he dropped out at the age of 16 to pursue rap music. His brother and manager, Elliot O'Connor, suggested Elmo come live with him in Los Angeles, California. There, he recorded most of his mixtapes and eventually met his friends Xavier Wulf, Chris Travis, and Eddy Baker, people he eventually toured and performed with under their collective name SESHOLLOWATERBOYZ (though has been disbanded due to conflicts within the members).  He is of Irish ancestry and also the grandson of actor Robert Culp.

He’s known for his unique “emo rap” style of music, which is labeled as strictly his own, as well as the rapid rate he releases music (including well over 100 music videos and 50 mixtapes) and his resistance to joining major record labels and charging money for his music, despite major interest by many.

[Verse 1]
Smoking like a motherfucker, higher than a motherfucker
Bitch, please stop the playing
SESHOLLOWATERBOYZ, deaf to them other boys
We can't hear a word you saying
We don't know your name, can't hang with the gang
Crowd jumping when the bass get banging
All I need is dope, so I gotta get paid
Never see me on the stage unless the money is arranged
My hair 1080, my teeth 240, my blunts 4K
And my dope you couldn't load it
If they ain't calling with a price, we don't answer that
Tryna fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that

[Chorus]
If they ain't calling with a price, we don't answer that
Tryna  fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Once I hit you with that backspace, you ain't comin' back
Control-Alt-Delete you, give me space like tab
Hit you with that backspace-

[Verse]
Used to be on Booth street, seeing 2D, nah
Now we do three, 1080 HD
Go press the AC, yellin' like it hate me
When the sun start screamin', I let my ice save me
I put it on, yeah, and my temperature drop (Drop)
Father time diamonds, press pause and they stop ya' (Stop)
Cryogenic pendants, I'ma be the last fossil
Now for my next trick, I will die proper
Loaded my duffel with these blades and they just got polished
Thinking 'bout that day bring me nothin' but solace
Runnin' up with that "Fuck it," I'm glad that I left my baggage
They all asked if it happened, replied with laughter
Never one to banter, I wanna up the ante
Every day I take the standard and put it where they can't see
Forever what they can't be, never understand me
I'd rather be the one they hate than the one they think is friendly (What? What?)
Dot zip the competition if there ever was any
Drag to the trash, ash, then I right-click, empty
You can't edit this body, all these layers are locked away
Told them System 32 is something they don't need to operate
System's frozen, now everybody hate me
Nothing new to me, I'm used to it thankfully
Reboot text, yes, you can all thank me
I am the virus that got your heart racing

Don't talk back if you don't want to meet me

Title: Sodium
Release Date: January 5, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Bones-sodium-lyrics
Song Description: BONES hails from Howell, Michigan. Though Michigan rap is often associated with the likes of Tee Grizzley, Baby Smoove, Babytron, and 42 Dugg, there has always been a cult following for artists with hard-hitting, dark, and bass oriented products. Sodium is no exclusion.

A ridiculous and addictive baseline wraps dark, disrespectful lyrics into a beautiful, headbanging experience. Seemingly taking inspiration from $uicideBoyz, Night Lovell, and old Ski Mask/XXXtentacion collaborations, BONES earned a RIAA certified Gold record for his outstanding work on Sodium.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
"This is not a wig, it's fucking real
If it was a wig, it would fucking come off right about now (Yeah)
I dyed it black, you like my shirt?
It says Mt. Vernon, 'cause that's where—because that’s where I actually live (Hometown)

[Verse]
How in the fuck are you 'bout to say
The way that we do it is not the way?
No, don't you sweat it, you not in the way
Nothing you do can put an end to my day
Cashed as fuck, on my bed, I lay
Look at the ceiling and fade away
Stressin' and checkin' on me for a blessin'
But I can't hear nothing, I'm gone for the day
"Sure you can afford that?" I get it
Lookin' like a bum, only think I'm holdin' pennies
Pull out your mortgage, just spend it in a minute
Take it how you want it, get mad when you get it
Blame everyone around you for the money you ain't gettin'
Boy, man up to the life you ain't livin'
Times, they get chiller, sometimes I forgive him
My mind's on a rhythm, so don't fuck up when I see you
Loose-knit, cotton chains bangin' off my body soundin' like a dog walkin'
Razor barkin' if you by me, let the scotch light blind 'em, let the switch restyle 'em
I ain't never goin' back to what I did back in Howell
Old BONES, new flow, still flickin' ash up on my clothes
1-800-DEADBOY if they need to hit my phone
Estate sell, ogles on the finger make me hopeful
We ain't never goin' back to nickel dimin' for some produceYou might also like38Embed

Title: RestInPeace
Release Date: January 12, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Bones-restinpeace-lyrics
Song Description: In RestInPeace BONES buries the underground rap scene with his gritty and screaming vocals. He sees himself as an artist that everyone is watching and copying. Therefore, BONES doesnt allow his true potential to show and instead wants to lay down all rappers who try to be like him.

Soundwise, the second track of Useless is an experimental track that combines several elements of both rap and metal. Most notable is the busy 808 bass and the deep vocal sample thats taken from the track Throw Ya Gunz by Onyx. RestInPeace also serves as an essential part of the genesis of the Trap Metal sub-genre, as it helped the sub-genre become more prominent in its early days.

Better than all y'all trippin', bitch, what's up?
DeadBoy walkin', see me, now everybody watchin'
Did it, now everybody talkin' just like us
Cashed, I'm a motherfucking mess
At least I say a slurred up speech then I rest in peace
They want my all but they'll never get the best of me
I keep the rest locked up then I ditch the key
See, I could go a little harder, bring the lava, make it hotter
Got 'em ringing out their shirts like "Fuck"
Carhartt patch, 48 up in the back
Jump straight up out the cage in the trunk
I don't know the city, boy, I came up from the gritty
Tell his parents that we left his body somewhere where it's chilly
I don't hail from a place where you grow up to be great
I'm the creep from the motherfucking first ave lake

[Hook]
I never thought I'd live to see all these fucking dreams
RIP to the whole fucking scene

Song Description: Track 8 on DeadBoy.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
"Ayo man, we bringing back the real knowledge
The real power in hip-hop
We are the streets, the movement
Hot street single smash"

[Verse]
We were sixteen, this means robbing was an option
Money was the problem, scrapping copper for some profit
Break it in for some gin, hope your mom don't got a problem
Throw the bottle over the fence, and I hope nobody saw us
We were gone, we were dead, resurrect and go to bed
Just some dirty white boys with some drugs up in our hands
Never slanging dope, no, cause we'd rather just smoke
Ice cold, back roads, tires covered in snow
I'm taking it back to the basics, I'm bringing it back to the basement
See this that Christmas light shining, hundred one blunts to the face, shit
See I was fifteen, drinking like I was fucking thirty-two
All the things you and your friends do, I did that too
Broken glass, blunt ash, dashing away with the product
Peep it, flip it for some dollars, then we buy some more bottles
Our parents thinking that we missing, haven't spoken some weeks
My shoes wet from the weather, hiding out from the heat

[Chorus]
I'm just a young bad kid, wasn't meant to do shit
I did things I wish I didn't, I got things I wish I did
Just a young bad kid, wasn't meant to be shit
I did things I wish I didn't, I got things I wish I did

She smell the smoke and she know it's SESH

What?
Lightin' up the blunt while I'm thinking of you
Walking down the block, I ain’t whippin' the coupe
Take another drag while I look at the moon
Young GPS, I come equipped with the route
I don't have to wonder 'cause I see the truth
I don't need love you can hear the proof
Break another bag while I feel the room
Start to look my way but I ain't in the mood
My closet's nothing but Harley
I ride hard without fallin'
Goodwrench on this DeadBoy
I rev the wheels now they foggy
Sponsors floodin' my inbox but there's one thing that they don't know
I stuff thick money in my thin socks
And I've yet to sign for no dough
You don't wanna die with a guy like me
I know that you
Got another plan
No, you got another dream so why can't you?
Breathe in
Exhale

[Verse 2]
SESH
Fuck you and your team
Fuck you and your dreams
You look like the rest and you sounding like me
Got a co-sign now you think you a beast
Fuck that and fuck this
I put that up on me
Act like you hard, but in person, you sweet
Yet to meet you, but I heard from the streets
You couldn't breathe if you stepped up to me
Look in my eyes and I'll show you the creep
Blade on my dick ain't a fuckin' thing changed

Realtree Camo with the Carhartt blade
Came from the place where the hatred was made
I'ma make you dark like it's late in the day
No matter what I think, you gonna hate what I say
Earnhardt blunts, smoking like we in a race
Friends turn cold like the blood in my veins
Thoughts in my mind, like the dirt in my graves
So I press my head to the wall, till it breaks

[Chorus]
Take you back home, where the moon don't glow
Where the sun don't shine, where the kids don't grow
Uptown where the youth get drowned
In the rag full of ether 'cause the kids don't know
Suicide rate up high when the winter rolls in and the money still low
And when he feels that snow, he knows it's the only way to get out the cold

[Verse 2]
Get out the cold, get out the cold
Life's too tough, bitch, please let me know
I take your life and turn it to gold
Roll my dope and turn to a ghost
Who you really think going harder than me?
Bitch, I'm dead bitch, bitch, I'm dead

Say you strapped like the army, claim you spraying the Tommy
I'm just a corpse on the porch, there's no way you can harm me
See I already passed, now I'm in a better place
With a fountain and some pillars and my girl to feed me grapes
If you thinking death is bad, let me tell you that it's great
Come and pay me a visit, I'm in the grave by the lake

Young Kevin Nash, just a victim of this cash
If the money make us choose, just make sure we make it back
Just make sure we make it flip, just make sure we make it last
Flow, roll, smoke, breathe, speak, creep and make it stack

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Droppin' down, hoppin' out straight out the casket
Pop, lock and drop ya like Huey done asked me
Mud on my corpse, if you crazy, I'm batshit
BONES is the one the game hate with a passion
When did it start? I think I know
The second I chose to come out of my tomb
Everyone gather, hold hands
And let out a big "Fuck you, BONES" on two
One, two, coming through
Your crew look like To Wong Foo
Give a fuck about your loot
Motherfucker, gimme truth
And if you all out of the latter, I'ma have ya take the first
Try to bop me for my spot

Hold up, someone get this boy a hearse

Lyrics:

[Video Intro]
"Down in yon forest, there stands a hall:
The bells of Paradise I heard them ring:
It’s covered all over with purple and pall
And I love my Lord Jesus above anything
In that hall there stands a bed:
The bells of Paradise I heard them ring:
It’s covered all over with scarlet so red:
And I love my Lord Jesus above anything"

[Intro]
Frozen

[Verse]
Sitting in the motherfucking dirt just hurt
Always bitching 'bout you "Never get the shit that you deserve"
While you rotting on the curb, I'ma take off with the birds
Waiting for the right time, but for me, now works
We forever create levels, hit the lever, kill the power
Every dot a witching hour on the clock up on the mantel
Don't be acting like you mental, you don't really wanna feel it
Hearing what ain't really there, seeing what you know you isn't
Exhale, blow the leaves, strip search all the trees
BONES like his forest sharp, leave if you don't want to bleed
All they wanna be is me, all I wanna do is leave
I contaminate the minds of the viewers of the slang
Fuck, and I thought it'd be different
Still the same message, don't care if you listening
And you used to be doubtful
You play the game but SESH make the console
How many fucking times do I gotta go and say it?
You ain't fucking with us, touching anything we fucking made
They watch then repeat through their own shit (Own shit)
But they'll never duplicate the flow, bitch (Flow, bitch)
If it ain't SESH, then you know I don't know it (Know I don't know it)

[Intro]
Wait

[Chorus]

Since I dropped the block been hot, no cooling (Yeah)
Rent flexing, spreading, stunting fake jewelry
No, those ain't diamonds, never me that you foolin' (Wait, wait, wait, wait, BONES)

[Verse 1]
It's 1997, Rock like Stairway to Heaven
I be at the top waitin' like somebody double dared me (Yeah)
When you never did it before
Sometimes it's funny when you focus on the people you know
Watch them react as you grow
Shit'll never get old to me, I'm ingrained in the program, you see
Even when I go, I don't leave, when I stop breathin'
I'll still be right here, turn around if you need me
Some words, some company, still got that blade under me
Layin' down but, no, I don't sleep (Fuck)
My eyes open, hopin' someone notice I am the only one
Awake when they ain't
But that's something that can't be done (Nope)
If no one's around to hear it, do it ever truly happen?
Says who? Light the blunt, flick the ash and say "Exactly"

Nobody special, that's me
Cut off your flow, now you got gangrene (Hey, you)
You hit the floor like they got that beam (Hey, you)
But I don't need a bullet to leave 'em dead at the scene

Made my own world like J.K. Rowling

Ever since we started, every day, it get larger (BONES)

[Chorus]
The rest of the game got me going "Ha" like Juvie (Like Juvie)

You're young, you make shitty rap music, you take pills
You're going to have the body of a geriatric patient

Fuck out the way, yeah
All your shit lame, yeah
I feel no pain, we're not the same, we in this thing
Scrapyard boy, backyard noise
Mold in my veins, can't breathe
Fuck this world, wasn't meant for me
Or the other way around, either way
We, we got what they need to get this bitch movin' (Yeah)
You, you see and repeat but still you can't do it (Yeah)

Go back online and go flex them racks

And realize that this shit is nothing but trouble, yeah
I hope that I figure out all this shit with time

[Verse 2]
Here we go again, sitting in the alleyway, bitch, I'm on a roll again
Glass in the street, bums sleeping on the curb
100 so-called good people pass without a word (Phew, yeah)

Say there's a price but you yet to ever pay shit

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Suicide two-tone
Bleeding with the roof gone
Bloody like a newborn
Cutting like a coupon
Pulling out my tendons just to make the wheel turn
Strike a match with my teeth just to let the weed burn
Ash on my shirt, shoelace on my waist
Fiji water in my lap, hydrated all day
SESHOLLOWATERBOYZ live from the grave
Got my hair pinned back like the fucking Green Ranger
Young Criss Angel
Trying to see my angle
Disappear in smoke, then I'm cash for some days
Rubber shoe sole, feel the pressure on the pavement
Pussy try to be me, just be thankful

[Chorus]
Riding in the camouflage Bronco
Looking like the white Benny Blanco
Blades on me, got your bitch growing legs and running away like Ponyo
Flow like my jaw broke

[Verse 2]
Tom Hanks, casting away
No shirt, no shoes, just blunts by the bay
Bales of the hay, snowflakes on the grave
That's life back home where regrets got made
Life got faced, windows got broke
Shit got took and shit got sold
'09, trucks in the yard
Brown Carhartts when the cold gets harsh
Uptown, D19
Bitch, I'm coming out the dirt with the blade on me

Welcome to my little slice of the journey
Out this cold life, me, I call it a burden
Let me burn, let me burn, fuck an urn
Sprinkle me to Earth, let me blend with the dirt
Biodegradable, I am the fable
The myth from the sticks, pale witch, cold razor
Trying your best to adapt to the fact
That you're stuck in the trap and there's no turning back
Now you just wanna go home
But you'll never get there, you just woke Bones
I be where the black mold grow

Title: KeepTellingYourselfThat
Release Date: February 7, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Bones-keeptellingyourselfthat-lyrics
Song Description: This song is a very subtle nod to the song Where is my Mind By The Pixies. This is shown in Vegards production, especially in the keys. This is probably due to the fact the song is a very popular one to cover. And has been done by many artists and bands.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
What?

[Verse 1]
The boy in the bubble, the furthest from trouble
When I look at you, it's like damn (Damn)
You give me sympathy practically instantly
I feel so bad, like, how could I be mad?
You on some shit I don't want (Want)
You on some shit I done did (Did)
We all got idols but don't feel too high up
And fall to an untimely end (End)
Go ahead out with your friends (Friends)
I'ma stay in and make ends (Ends)
Meet, like a blind date
Fuck what the time say
If it ain't five to SESH then I can't
You yet to see the best that I can
Earth will end if BONES get uncanned
Sherpa lined everything, let them see every stain
Fifty-nine everyday, burnt to the membrane
Flashback slumped in the breezeway (Breezeway)
Thinkin' I can't do this shit forever (Ever)
Fuck doing their way, I'ma go my way
Hundred highways not long enough for my race
I'ma take it further than that
All these pussies think they take it further than rap, no
You take it nowhere quick, nobody give a fuck 'bout the money that you get
And if you convince yourself any different
It's safe to say you gone and been missing
Off in a land I could have predicted
Molded by thoughts of those who don't get you

[Verse 2]
Feeling something like Larry David
Observe the world and then I get to shamin'
Shit go wrong, I'm the one they blamin'
While the rest get on stage and they blow it like Kramer
Stranger-stranger, who really stranger?
'Cause I don't know you but I know my anger
Worried 'bout your album, say you need more bangers
BONES never approach that ledge with danger
Say you a star, end the conversation
Me and my brothers make the constellation
I'ma get it now, I'm far from patient
Can't sit still, I forever go crazy
The store clerk know what I need when I walk in
Who bought out the bricks first night that they got in?
Who got what they need when they need it? I'll drop hints
I'm pointing all over, like, I promise it's not him25Embed

Creeping up from behind
Money up on my mind
Butterfly on my side
Make it fly then you die
I've got lies in my eyes
All my times' been reprised
Compromised with my lies
Now I'm stuck inside my mind
Resurrect everytime I die
Crash and survive everytime I ride
Cash sight eyes with a blunt I fly
On my broomstick, high up in the sky
Levitate down 'til my feet feel ground
I don't give a fuck how you feel now
Never gave a fuck how we felt then
But now we on and now you want it now
Rolling with the roof blown off
Stolen when the blade get drawn
Hold it, do you really wanna live?
Do you really wanna die?
Do you really wanna try me?
Show me, tell me, throw me, roll me
Body made of drugs, might as well just smoke me
Hold me closely, put me away

Release Date: June 8, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Bones-ifyouhadazuneihateyou-lyrics
Song Description: IfYouHadAZuneIHateYou directly references the past as the underline theme. The memories of the past cause recollection even in the most mundane parts of life. This coupled with the conflicts of aging, wanting to forget, and self-destructive behavior, takes the listener to a place of remembrance and feelings of past events, loneliness, and pain from a loved one. A point of view from both Bones and Corbin express an overall emotional setting for this perfect collaboration.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Spooky Black]
Memories of you, they start to fade
Only see your shape when I'm in the rain
I want to hear your voice, baby, once again
Wanna see your face before the end
Always in the back of my mind
If you were here, I'd still be alive
When will you realize
Just another teen suicide
Close my eyes, I'm going cold
Die young, never growing old
I'm losing my fucking hope
All these blunts and they're getting rolled

[Verse 2: BONES]
I'm waiting by the water
I'm floating on my back
I'm hoping that you're ok
All I need to know is that
You're ok when I'm miles away from you
All I dream about is seeing the face of you
The rain hits the window and it falls like night
Lying in my sheets with you, with me

Say that you hard but, no, I disagree
Thinking we cool but, bitch, I don't agree
I don't need friends no more, I don't want people
Since this is my dream, I don't even need sleep
Don't know your shit, never heard of your tape
Don't know your bitch but I bet she heard me
Worry 'bout nothing, you worry 'bout everything
You can do nothing, bitch, I can do anything
Voice of a Veteran, veins of adrenaline
Once he step up to me, there ain't no saving him
I will not pray for him, I will not savour him
I will make sure it's my yard that he laying in
Flame on my Davidson, ash on my razor
There's nobody like me, for sure no caucasians
The world in my hands, let it drop to the pavement
I never need payback, I only get payments

[Verse 2]
Thought I was done, but, no, bitch, I don't stop
Act like you don't care but we know you lie
If you were to give him the offers I got
Put that check in his face and I bet he gon' pop
Go to the club just in hopes that they spot
You get a picture, now you think you hot
Walk in your town and I post on your block
Like "Fuck what you had and fuck what you got"
People impressed with you but I am not
I'm strict with this shit and you missing the plot

You ain't slangin stop, I pull up
Parking lots, you ain't arranging rocks, I know that
You think it's hard cause you've seen it done
Slash heard, you're a sponge, never be your own
Man, can't you understand how I came in the game?
Yeah me neither, no breathin', it's amazing I make
My way out the other side of my personal maze
I was stuffed for a minute, couldn't feel my legs
I had to bounce, back, like the rubber band snap
Round the ziplock bag full of money that we stashed
In the wall downstairs, that was back in 2010
I was just about to leave, no one knew just how to feel

[Refrain]
But I did, that's why I wait and feel
Calm inside cause I am real
I am me and you are you
Running around tryin' to chase this loot

[Verse 2]
Hop straight back in and then I glist to the finish
White noise in the flesh, hair down, never see me
I done tried to make it clear, I do not think that they hear me
Mic check, 1, 2,  Ri-ri-rick in the building
Got my hi-vis and my blade look like I'm building
On the site with my clipboard, smoking and chilling
No hard hat, no whistle, still officially killing
Every fucking working brain within a arms length distance
You get melted into ashes and I'm casting you to iron
Turn you to a blade of mine, so I can use your life in spite

Title: RightClickSaveIt
Release Date: November 1, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Bones-rightclicksaveit-lyrics
Song Description: The thirteenth song on TheManInTheRadiator, which was long anticipated by everyone over the course of many months.

Without a direct reference, the name of the song and the hook correlate to a previous track of Elmos from the allbum Unrendered, where he uses the phrase right click, save it in the context of finding a patch of untouched land. The song in question is SystemPreferences:

Envision nothing but forests that still intact (-tact)
I see a place with no pavement, I right click save it
No painter could ever paint it, no scholar could ever say it (what?)

The above likely matches itself with the albums cover and theme, as seen through the trailers and tease pictures, where most of the time an abandoned forest or house is present, often with a skeleton accompanying the image.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
What? What?

[Verse]
Привет, bitch, как дела?
Tell the reaper, hurry up, like arriba
The Terminator of the game, like "I'll be back"
I did whatever it took to, never a 9 to 5
No, don't you lie, no, don't you cry
Light the fuse and I'll blow like the 4th of July
You will comply, or I will supply your life
With such pain that is hard to describe
I am hard to define I'm rather off in design
Hate life to the point there ain't shit I desire
Said you'd pull up on me
But you've yet to come by
Injected with lies, infected with rhymes
What is it that you do, come and please remind
I'm the type of machine that put you in rewind
Bring you back to the very first time
You have ever felt fear running down your spine

Wide awake, I hear you walking, ayy
Sleepwalk if the dope don't come
Never really gave a fuck if you don't like
The way we do it from the movies to the music
I smile and I know that it's alright
Fuck is the word? Touch me and burn
Don't make me embarrass you
Was eager to learn, fuck waiting our turn
There's just no comparing us
Do it right every time
Without even fucking trying
It never get fucking tiring
I change up the way they write
I've seen it once, I've seen it twice
I've seen it too many times
“We hope SESH blow up”
It do, now they look oh-so surprised
“Now it's different”, quit the bitching
I don't want your ass to listen
Pour a trendy four and drink it
'Til your heart no longer ticking, ayy
Tired of the motherfucking hold-up
I touch the world and it froze up
Promise I never care, promise I never will
Give a fuck 'bout if they know us
That never meant a thing
Fuck if you're listening

Now our words are what they're speaking
Shit a little different, I admit it
'Cause now I can buy some fucking dinner
Pussies bitching like it's tradition
Bitch, I'd rather you don't listen
I'll be honest, that's a promise, I ain't no one to look up to
Rather you look down on me
Frown upon me and tell me that I'm not what you thought that I was
No, I don't need no “Yo, Bones, you killing it”
Fuck up and listen, that's not why I'm doing it
It's not a choice, I am the noise
Static bring havoc, I live in the void
We are just something you cannot explain
Radiate rays that you cannot ignore
I don't go quiet, I'm slamming the door
El say to get it, I handle the chore
Never fit in, I stuck out like a sore thumb
And I'm numb everywhere that we are
My blunt go out and the people they run
Cashed and I'm apt to attack when it's done

Lyrics:

[Verse]
Everybody knows that I'm the best around
They don't even know why
I look like Bret Hart mixed with Dylan Klebold
Let me wipe the propane in my eye
School shooter jacket with the wood grain blade
Butterfly strapped in the sock for the prey
Waiting and debating for the time and the day
I should unleash every single plan that I made
Plan that I made, right, aim for the hate
Every kid and teacher that ever picked on me
Grip, don't squeeze
I don't want to make you bleed
But I know what a scene you'd have seen when I leave
Crime scene when I leave, in the woods when I flee
Back to the cabin with a smile on me
Dig another cellar then I'm ready for the weather
Bitch, I'm coming down, you better remember just what I'm telling

Song Description: The song targets the Columbine High School Massacre in 1999, which the entire project brings to life in an eery way. You almost cant believe there is a rapper calling themself young Dylan Klebold, but the dark tone and atmosphere of the song sparks a slight curiosity to say the least. Love it or hate it, Bones pays homage to himself and the troubled minds of Dylan and Eric.

Your mixtape need a laugh track, I'm past that
Tell your manager, take his check and go cash that
He gon' need it, hope that he just save it
Rainy days are coming 'cause your gimmick is fadin'
I picture Eden in my head and hope one day I get to visit
A place with no stealing, killing, no diamonds or digits
No barely swimming fishes in the creek, they don't fit in
Drain the water, have a feast, to me you really just dinner
All y'all pitiful, look at all y'all benefit off
Of taking another style to pass as original
I'm a whole different animal, I am me to a fault
Showed the world my worst traits and kept the best in a vault
It's like a dark obsession with never showin' my all
I am the man behind the curtain makin' shapes on the wall
(What?)
I am the man behind the curtain making shapes on the wall, SESH

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I pulled the sword from the stone
I saved a village in Rome
I traveled back to 30 BB, that's way before BONES
I fought off hordes of orcs, swingin', slingin' swords and forks
Lightin' up my copper torch, it's easy like the Commodores
The missing gear is I, shinin' while I wait to die
They talk shit until they see me, then they can't decide
They look into my eyes and see a rather awful shine
They cannot quite put they finger on why I am not alright
Well, join the club, answer's something I would love
But I don't think I'll ever get a reply like I'm signin' off
I'm slidin' off with something fucked inside the blunt that got me
Cashed every day, do not depend on me for nothing, what?

Title: TheCafeteria
Release Date: February 25, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Bones-thecafeteria-lyrics
Song Description: This song most likely describes when after killing their victims in the library, Eric and Dylan walked backed to the cafeteria where they had placed their bombs. It is during this that the infamous security image seen around the world was captured. Also during this time, we see Eric Harris shooting at the Bombs they placed with his 9mm Carbine rifle, most likely in the hopes he would set them off and kill not only everyone else in the school but themselves.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Congratulations! You won

[Verse]
Propane, pipe bombs
Flash like Nikons
Young dead suicidal superstar icon
I make them nervous, like the image of me lurkin'
In the halls with the weapon, only purpose is to murder
And now you didn't mean it
You tell me you were kiddin'
Read the plans in my notebook and see why I did it
Two hours 'fore the cops come
Yeah, now it's locked down
Everybody runnin' like some fiends when the cops 'round
Smokin' in my trench coat
Waitin' for my next go
Water comin' down from the sprinklers on my neck froze
Let's go, next 'doe
Then the cafeteria
My mind is in a trance, my ears are locked out, I am not hearin' ya
I'm feelin' somethin' like Eric
But I'm lookin' just like Dylan
Just another white trash kid with his mind battled
All he ever wanted to do was kill 'em
These boys act tough 'til they ribs erupt
Leave ya body in the library next to ya favorite book, boy

Title: BlastZone (ЗонаПоражения)
Release Date: December 23, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Bones-blastzone-lyrics
Song Description: BlastZone () is the opening track of Bones' last 2017 project titled CARCASS ().

This is one of the rappers more harder songs that can be put in one line with his other bangers, such as RestInPiece, Oxygen, BlackMold, etc.

The track was produced by TEVAL, a rather obscure Ukranian producer, who sent a few of his beats to Bones. This is not the only song off CARCASS () that features TEVAL, however, as CharacterSelect is also produced by him.

On March 25, 2018 the music video was released for BlastZone (). It was shot during Bones' European tour that took place in the beginning of 2018. In this video Bones returns to the VHS aesthetic that he has been using since the early days of his music career.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
TEVAL (SESH)

[Verse 1]
Fuck all your vanity, shame on your family
Death to your friends and the ones that you love
No one containing me, utter calamity
See what you made me do? Look what you done
TeamSESH, DeadBoy, drop it on your head boy
Never not cashed, make a mountain of ash
Every day of the past I dread, boy
I stumble over my own feet, too high to function
I'm coming, open up my catalog, I've done it
To be humble, you say you underground, but you just under
Honest, every time we drop, we got them running
What?

[Break]
"Warning, warning, warning, warning
Warning, warning, warning, warning"
"This is a message from General Mark Meeks
If you're receiving this message, you're in the blast zone
Cities within forty miles are infected
You must seek shelter immediately"

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you can talk, but, no, you can't hide
Engine that couldn't, bitch, you cannot ride
The track that I'm on is for the divine
DeadBoys multiply then divide
White noise on the screen make me blind

Young Jonathan Taylor Thomas, ridin' in a hummer
See, bitches like Joe, they see me and start to stutter
I'm sittin' on butter, I'm smokin' 'til the sun up
And then I roll another and let it burn like Usher
Jenny from the block looking bitch, just stop
You thinkin' that you hard but you just a fuckin' bop
You'll never get respect, they'll never cut the check
Bitch, don't hold your breath 'less you wanna meet death
I got a new blade, I'm tryna break it in
I'm hopin' that you come up with some shit so we can get it
See BONES let em' have it
I'm creepin' through the alley
I hit the blunt once and fly away like Lenny Kravitz
See, I ain't even rappin'
See, flowin's just a habit
I hope you know what happens if you tryna bring me static
I'm cuttin' off the lights, you runnin' for your life
But really you just runnin' 'til you run into my knife
Dark cold forest, precipitation pourin'
See, just because you dyin' doesn't mean that you important
Nobody gon' miss ya, I promise, give it time
The memory of you will slowly fade up in they minds
Your room gets changed, your clothes put away
There's nothing like you left it and it hurts to even breathe
The smile on your parents just as fake as their intentions

Lyrics:

[Verse]
Some days better than others, yeah, I agree
Other days, I forget I'm lucky I can breathe
Weird how it works, how the wheels, they turn
Me to roadkill when I'm hoppin' off the curb
Misplace words with a distinct verb
Now you feel like you do something for the world
Sorry to say, but we blew that chance
The last of the grains gone, no more sands
Now we stand as the trap door opens
Slowly we fall where eternity closes
We just wanna find a direction to point a finger
And say "It's not mine, it's yours"
Permanent cycle is branded within'
From a seed to a tree, always know what you is
Support what supports you
It's up to you, do what you want to do
Hopefully, you give back to the roots
Give back to the roots

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Motherfuck today, bitch, I'm waiting on tomorrow
D-19 reppin', where you die or get offed
Lost in the woods, keep a weapon in the car
Or get left near the railroad, the forest is your morgue
Addiction off the Richter, feeling like I'm Dave Navarro
Motherfuck today, bitch, I'm waiting on tomorrow
Settin' off alarms, fire storm without warnin'
Tell me tone it down, don't ever hear it, bitch, I'm in the moment
Reaper forever sittin' right by me
Waitin' until it's perfect timing
I'm in full 360 surveillance, that bitch will never get to me
He know what the consequence is when you steppin' to me

[Chorus]
What's the deal, how you feel?
What's the deal, how you feel?
What?

[Verse 2]
God damn, hot damn, hotter than a frying pan
Put me on the stove, don't touch me
I'm 'bout to fly and go to Russia
Привет to the rubles I'm touchin'
Bust it, forever used to nothin', gunnin' 'til the day we ain't hungry
Fuck it, can't recite a verse of Marvin Gaye then I don't trust you
Buggin', used to white truck it, rust in my cuts, can't stomach
Someone cue the violins, bleeding from my eyelids
Nosferatu in the dungeon
Super 8 film burn dissipate my features
Can't make out who is it that that's creepin'
Fall with the night, turn you to ash without a light
Show you the past, I project out my hands at your eyes
Feel it in your spine, these memories are alive
As for you, I am pleased to say it's your time

Blade on my waist
Blunt to the face and I'm up in this thang
Drugs in my veins, your bitch is so lame
Remember her throat, don't remember her name
Creep in the night, hear my knife from the flip
Taking your life then I'm taking your bitch (Ah)
Feeding her drugs and watchin' her die
Kiss on her lips then I'm shutting her eyes
If she with BONES, she ain't leavin' alive
Truthfully die, she was livin' a lie
Hated her folks, loved all the drugs
Hated true love, she just love to fuck
Love just to gut, love just to roll (Roll)
Hated just to talk, so she always moans (Moan)
Ridin' all alone and I wish that I was home (Home)
Wishin' that I didn't go down this road (Road)
The day that I die, hope my mama don't cry (Cry)
Hope she realize it was just my time (Time)
Nobody ever ready to bury their own child
But I'm dead already, so I'm good for a while
Young white punk, dead girls rollin' blunts (What?)
Blood on the Backwood, roll 'til she numb (Yeah)
Cuts on her wrists, teardrops on the face
So I flip my switchblade just to let her know she's safe (Oh)
She just want BONES, I wanna be alone
I don't need friends, I don't need no home (No)
I don't want money, I don't need a fuckin' car (Ugh)
Rather sleep in the alley, rather live with the bums (SESH)
Young fucking scumbag, I don't know how (How)
Bitches like me, but fuck it, it's alright
They hear how I rhyme, see how I act (BONES)
They see my shows just to hear me rap (What?)
Baby, I could save you, come with me now (Now)
Take her to the grave then I put her in the ground (Ground)
Hands on her neck, now she's saying, "Take my life" (Life)

Ernie Bishop: George is a good guy. Give him a break, God

George Bailey, I'm wishing on it daily
But I don't get the luxury of visions of my vanquish
I'm stuck assuming it's fine
Smoke in my eyes, burn my retina, make me blind
Everything in line, hold my breath, then I dive
100-story drop until my brain's offline
I power down just to restart again
100 tabs lost, wait, now what was I sayin'
What I was thinkin' I feel so much better now
My favorite joke is life because it's "us" it's based around
What I was thinkin' I feel so much better now
My favorite joke is life because it's "us" it's based around

[Hook]
I always get a laugh out of it in the end
I hope you understand because I know I...

The first time was the last time
The last time felt like the first time
I'm trying to find the place deep inside
I can be all by myself tonight
I be smoking too much, be sober too little

The way that I be living I hope that I see my children
See them break my rules, see them doing what they shouldn't
Middle of the night, outside by myself
Breathing in the air, hoping that it ends well
Silence in my ear, too loud, can't hear
Echoes in the streets be the sound of the breeze

One and only, Mac like Roni
Mannie fresh jigging into motherfuckin' home base
Damier checks, that's a motherfuckin' cold case
Lookin' all around and it's nothing like the old place, whoa
Black rob when I open up my eyes, I'm the first one surprised
When I'm looking like whoa
Use to pay in quarters now we pull up the store
Baby, run on through the door like go
Team never gave a fuck, SESH forever going up
Every second of the day, every breath that's in my lungs
Every time I fumigate, turn the breeze to a gust
Drop it down, where you stay?

[Chorus]
We could stop drop and roll forever
'Cause fires happen no matter the weather
You can hope for the best, but you know the worst might come

[Post-Chorus]
Just leave my body somewhere dark
Put all my things in a box on the porch (Yeah, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2]
Fade into the scene, know it's BONES, no "Who's he?"
So they pull they cameras out and zoom like boosie
Fruits of my labor, all my fruits from the neighbors
I don't bend for no favors, bitch, I give 'em every flavor
Moves every day and that's how I've remained
Ever since Nigo had the ice cream chain
Back when a hundred dollars sounded like a dream
Now it's hundred times that every time I scream
The bandwidth way too light for me
I break the servers, I fry the machine
See, people never really took a liking to me

[Verse]
Every day they're getting older, more worried 'bout looking younger
It's a patternized cycle, show your face with every slumber
It’s equivalent to being full and longing for the hunger
Guess it only takes nine months to build a life of suffering
Money's not enough for them, just waking up's enough for me
Told 'em how I felt and then we sat uncomfortably
It's up to me, one of them said
If you think you can't, well it's all in your head
As I shut the front door behind me
For the first time, I’ve come out of hiding

Lights off just staring at the wall, cut to me, lights on, just nobody home (Wait)

[Verse 2]
I'm shaking, I'm panicking, seconds I'll never get back (Back)
'Cause I threw 'em away like some evidence
Ready for reckoning, smoking, no questioning
Juice in the mason, make calls like I'm checking in (Oh fuck)
Look at the burial, see the resemblance
Between myself and the ones who I've ended
Hope it's to me that they pay no attention
Shoo 'em away to my dungeon I vanish
DeadBoy, I could never ever stop, no
Yelling underground but you making pop songs (Yeah)
I could lie and say you got something going on
But since day one, bitch, you got it all wrong
Always living in contrast and trying to compare
Wish they could feel okay in the skin they wear

[Chorus]
Stomp you in some shoes I ain't drop yet (That's right)
Eyes drop to the floor, I'm a hot mess (That's right)
I scream into the night like "Stop this" (That's right)
Every time I do some shit I'm like let's drop this (That's right)
Stomp you in some shoes I ain't drop yet (That's right)
Eyes drop to the floor, I'm a hot mess (That's right)
I scream into the night like "Stop this" (That's right)
Every time I do some shit I'm like let's drop this
Stomp you in some shoes I ain't drop yet
Eyes drop to the floor, I'm a hot mess

Release Date: March 18, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Bones-thehealingfields-lyrics
Song Description: A single off of the album Powder produced by the known member of BONES music collective, TeamSESH, known as Greaf. This song talks about the problems BONES has with the world in the heat of our new modern and industrial practices, and the greed involved with them. Such as these lyrics from the song,

I know its hard because the humans fucked up the loop
Sick people spend money why the fuck you look astonished
What the fucks a business wanting other than profit bitch?
Nothing

This is one of the longest BONES songs that have been released.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Powder

[Verse 1]
Sick animals deceased, riding interstates
Off the truck to the market, now your dinner plate
And you think you clean?
None of my labels read BHT
Plant-based proteins slow me like morphine
Everything saturated, everything for me
For you if you want it to
I know it's hard 'cause the humans fucked up the loop
Sick people spend money, why the fuck you look astonished?
What the fuck's a business wanting other than profit, bitch? Nothing
Just breathe, don't think too deep
Where the undertow heavy and the current don't leave
Under trees where the shade bring safety
All my mother hoped was that I got home safely
BPA-free bottles on the counter
Too cashed as of lately, I don't wanna think about, I

[Chorus]
Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying
Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying
Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying
Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying
You might also like[Verse 2]
Stop with the speaking 'cause I done heard everything
Don't come too close to me, boy, I hurt anything
Don't wanna be here but thank you for letting me
Look in the mirror, think "Am I what's best for me?"
Raised in a place where it's best if you die
Nothing there's enough to keep you alive
Even if you do find work
You'll still be living in a town made of dirt
Fresh grain from the best plains
At the shows head-banging 'til it's neck pain
Next blunt, next night then the next day
I'm cashed 'til I exit, let me explain
No phone, no number, no conversation
Blood creeping through my veins with such contemplation
Do we wanna let 'em live? Hell no
They could struggle 'til they go but they'll never be BONES

[Chorus]
Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying
Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying
Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying
Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying

Song Description: The intro and outro comes from Lets talk about death | Stephen Cave | TEDxBratislava

Lyrics:

[Intro]
What did it mean that he was dead? Where had he gone? It was like a hole, in reality, had opened up and swallowed him. But then the really shocking question occurred to me: If he could die, could it happen to me too? Could that hole, in reality, open up and swallow me? Would it open up beneath my bed and swallow me as I slept?
SESH

[Verse]
If this was on cinema, this a five bagger
Young Turkington working it, you just the actor
But since you the opposite, you are now obligated
To ride out this unfortunate consequence
I be on top of it, you, you look out of it
Step back and see that you trash and no doubting it
Hope that you saving some shekels and counting it
'Cause truth of the matter is, you ain't gon' last long
'Cause we around, streets get shut down when we in town
Funny when I zoom out, look at what we do now
Fuck it, zoom in, gotta get back to the groove now
No time to look back or think about the math
When you dictate the future, the present and the past
101 passed zero blunts out the bag
M-59 scumbag still tryna scrap
Started out in the warehouse just like Tony Hawk
Pro Skater, now we on the stage of the theater
I light up when lights hit my white skin, turn demon
My eyes turn to ash and fall out of my sockets
The razor appear slowly out of my pocket
Saliva drippin' out my mouth burn the carpet
The carpenter here to show you to your coffin
I put the nail in and I bang, bang
These rappers, they sayin' the same thang
Crack you a seal then you pop you a aid
'Til you high enough to think you killin' the game
Bitch, I don't come from a place where they drank
Hail from a place where that rag to your face
Wanna get high then you find you a ride
And you siphon it dry 'til you blue in the face
Think that you gone 'til I take you back home
Under the bridge where the mold go to grow
Don't crawl on fos, boy, we crawl on all fours
Siphon through trash, turn to cash in our palms
I don't see you on the radar at all
It's kinda funny that you wanna talk
About making noise, you don't see the point
There's nothing your brain could produce I'd enjoy

For the beat of WhiteTrashMidwesternTown, the intro guitar and some of the vocals were sampled off Sirens by Maximillian Hecker.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=91&v=0HJiI-FcZhc
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: BONES]
You used to say when I was down
There's more to life outside this white trash midwestern town
You birthed the spark in my brain
Said it'd be sunny, but that night it rained
Wet shoes as I stepped on the plane
Found my seat and closed the window shade
I fell asleep and then awoke to a shake
I overheard like they spoke my name
The captain said, "It'll be a task to make it
To LAX with a storm like this
We'll try our best," he said with a nervous grin
You could hear the breath, you could see the face
Of a man who'd cut the tension if his hands didn't shake
He's got a wife, two girls, and a home on the ground
And the most disturbing part is they don't know it's going down
The most disturbing part is they don't know it's going down
The most disturbing part is they don't know it's going down

[Chorus: Maximilian Hecker]
Up in the sky of lights
Turn on earth of life
Lowering my eyes to see you
Telling all lies to be with you

[Verse 2: BONES]
But not in the fire and not in the crash
They'll weather the storm, you say we'll land intact
It's when he goes home that it becomes real
There's a small part of him that resents the wheels
He hates the wings and the bolts that hold them
Together like promises they never told him
He thinks they deserve the same life that he had
He wished the fucking engine would've blown to piecesYou might also like18Embed

Now life caught my attention ('ttention)
You still ignore the seconds, years thrown away for nothing

It's un… It's unbelievable
The story… Of my life

[Verse]
Self-hate in my veins while she twisting up my braids
I don't gotta say a thing 'cause she know where I remain
I got memories for days, full of faces with no names
Image stained in my brain of me smoking in the rain
On the porch, fuck a Porsche, we ain't never leaving town
Fuck a job, fuck a gown, we ain't never leaving Howell
But a lot of things changed since ECD
I used to sleep in the house off D-19
Now it's funny 'cause kids want to be like me
'Cause I know they wouldn't like me if they really knew me

[Chorus]
I'm making money, but what's it mean?
I think it's funny, 'cause all I think
Is how great life seemed when we were broke
No money, no food, no weed to smoke
But the money here now and we got the dope
And we always eat but I feel alone

[Verse 1: BONES & Xavier Wulf]
It's to the point where I don't know who I am
I'm at a place where I don't think no one cares
Bruise my skin, throw my bag down the stairs
Look me in my eyes and say you don't care
I've got some problems, I know that you've got yours
I'm not special, I'm nothing to adore
I drown myself with every lie that I told
I'll probably be this way until I'm old

[Verse 2: Xavier Wulf]
Listen up bitches, does anyone know the truth here?
I've been around and around and around and everyone fucking lies to me
And if anyone thinks I'm an idiot, come and find me, I wanna kill you
I smoke so much that I don't think that it's good for me

[Intro: Robert Kennedy]
Could you lower those signs, please?
I have some very sad news for all of you, and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight
Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice between fellow human beings
He died in the cause of that effort

[Verse: BONES]
See, I could make the world crazy from the sound of a drop
You tryin' to calm me like Bobby when MLK got shot
See El feelin' like Slim back when Wayne got hot
And everybody thinkin', "Damn, will he change or not?"
I been the same every day and that's my biggest fuckin' downfall
Say they fuck with me but can't name a fuckin' album
Sayin' that they bought one, I've yet to fuckin' sell one
Say they love me but they don't know Elmo
I don't want a outcome, that's the fuckin' thing
They waitin' on labels, labels waitin' on me
Wantin' the change from the beats to the names
Rather nickel-dime every meal than be in the game
Fuck you, fuck rap and fuck hip-hop
Like I really give a fuck if I'm hot or not
No car, no chains, I ain't fuckin' all these bitches
Still, life so sweet and I don't even fuck with Swishers

[Chorus: BONES]
Backwoods guts on my shoes, never playin' by the rules

[Instrumental]


Part II: "ThatStuffWillKillYa"

[Verse]
Countries are banning ingredients based off the cancer that's linked to the study
Our country do nothing, it don't want us healthy, it don't want nothing else but money
No concern of dying, no concern of living, the outcome is so fucking funny
Humans are fighting with weapons but more of 'em die from what's inside their stomach
Nothing but trash, and you thinking it's natural, hope that they never look into it
Killing myself every time that I smoke, but I draw the line for when I'm eating, bitch
Fuck what you thinking and fuck what you heard and fuck all these things that they're feeding me
Fuck all the time that I wasted away eating up what has been eating me
Say that you care, bitch, I know that you don't, eat up the burger, wash it down with coke
American living, you're doing your best, you working real hard and the weekend, you rest

Lyrics:

[Verse]
Steppin' out the crib like it's 1986
T-top Trans Am, ridin' with your bitch
Take her to the point, drive her back off in the morning
Just a young fuckin' stud, flick my hair then I'm rollin'
I got drugs if you want to feel the high
Backwoods if you want to catch the sky
Perfect mowed lawns, architecture, no flaws
Just a calm, safe neighborhood, tucked behind the mall
Parents go to work, probably think that I'm at school
But the music's got into me and it took away my soul
I just want to rock, headbanging to the ‘knot
Bitch I Bawitdaba, never callin' it off
Never fallin' at all, never worry 'bout a thing
Everything is just peaches, I'm smokin' in the breeze
Sittin' in the shade underneath the weepin' willow
Blunt guts on the grass, unraveling cigarillos
And I think

[Chorus]
Now this is really nice
Breathin' in the dope, watch the clouds roll by
This can't be real life

Think you're a big man with some big plans
Think there's power in your stance and it's odd to me
If you want something, go get it
Don't wait around to see the winter

Life doesn't stop, so make use of the minutes
Make use of the minutes, we gettin' them until we wasting the seconds
The only regret I regret is regretting the things I've regretted

She pulled up on me in her Sileighty tryna reach for me
She can't even race 'cause she can't focus when she think of me

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
What, what?

[Verse 1]
BONES in the house, the roof is on fire
Spit gasoline, D-19 messiah
Bicker, bicker, boy I came back to spite 'em
Ain't nobody higher, my lighter will help guide 'em
To a whole new layer, you dare, but you just can't
My whole life was spent in the boot camp of the damned
Your two cents is worthless, makin' me nervous
Heard your shit, it's like you're tryin' to be wack on purpose
Proficient in killin' off every wack MC
And it'll stay that way until I D-I-E
Almost been 10 years since I came on the scene
And ain't a motherfucker ever try to step to me

[Chorus]
(Back again with something new to hate)
They know the biz
They know just who it is
(Back again with something new to hate)
Try their best but they cannot defend
(Back again with something new to hate)
They know the biz
They know just who it is
(Back again with something new to hate)
Try their best but they cannot defend

Just like Ponyboy, I stay golden
Neck, hands, wrist, every ring be frozen
Anytime that you see BONES, just know I'm holdin'
Aromatic rollin', smokin' and chokin'
100 spoke rims on the six-four pokin'
Kickin' this game for free, you just do this shit for tokens
Money, fame, and whatever it brings
All I see is depleted minds when I look at the scene
Just some drugged out pussies that simply couldn't handle
Stepping up to BONES, let alone hold a candle
But I am numb to this stuff
As I huff, and I puff
And I blow down these blunts

[Chorus]
(Back again with something new to hate)
They know the biz
They know just who it is
(Back again with something new to hate)
Try their best but they cannot defend
(Back again with something new to hate)
They know the biz
They know just who it is
(Back again with something new to hate)
Try their best but they cannot defend2Embed

[Verse]
I don't got diamonds, I don't got cars
I don't have money to go throw it at the bar
I don't got hoes but I know where they are
I don't like bitches cause they talk too much
I don't want fame cause that shit will always kill you
All my favorite rappers either popped or ain't with us
Riding in the drop, bumping City and Colour
Day Old Hate when the rain start falling
Motherfuck a label, do it on my own
Switchblade on, don't you ever get it wrong
Way too high to even motherfucking move
Your girlfriend see me and know what to do
These women want sex and we all know that
So I just flow, let the rest fall back
Back in the place, now the world's all mine
A hundred one bitches on my motherfucking line

[Hook]
I just need to know if you really down to roll
If you trynna go, bitch you need to let me know
You so far down this road, there ain't nowhere else to go
I brought a lot of drugs, shut your mouth and fucking roll
I just need to know, I just need to know
I just need to know, if you really trynna go
She say she love my songs, she say she love the flow
She say she wanna blow, cause she heard I'm 'bout to blowYou might also like8Embed

Song Description: Originally known as WhateverYouDoDontLookDown, DontLookDown is the 9th off the mixtape KickingTheBucket.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
VVS overbite, I roll the dice
Thinking about a corporate life, froze like the coldest night
Looking out of the world from a ledge hoping like
"Maybe if I smoke myself to death, I won't be so precise"
So pristine, used to paying for a open mic
BONES killed the microphone, you, you just hold the mic
Pimp like Dolemite, high like dragonite
Me against the world, results that show they ain't half as nice
A creature of habit, you keep on the Pateks
I don't need a clock to tell me when to bring you the static
I'ma pressed juice addict, got the jars in the attic
Don't act like you get down when you ain't even heard of CRACKER
I hope you got a backup, plan B or something
'Cause when I go and get to bustin'
You'll be gone somewhere recovering
Too cashed, I'm hovering, women they be loving it
TeamSESH stamped in their brain, steady buffering
What?

The thing that hurts the most, I know when I'm too stubborn
To even see your son, cause I don't want to see his mother
Thinking about what she did to you, I'm filled with hate
Wish that I could take away your pain but it's too late
Now I only see your face in the dreams that I have
Every night I go to sleep, I hope it happens again
It's funny 'cause you were 20, I pictured you as a kid
Around the time we first met, it was like seven or six
Made me cry like a bitch, even writing this shit
Didn't even know you did drugs, maybe you were embarrassed by it
Or maybe the distance between us physically kept me out of it
But it kills me to know it took other people to even hear about it

[Refrain]
I know, you didn't mean for this to happen
Yeah I know, all you wanted to be was happy
Yeah I know, you didn't mean for this to happen
Yeah I know, all you wanted to be was happy

Title: TheRoadLessTraveled
Release Date: January 11, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Bones-theroadlesstraveled-lyrics
Song Description: In this song, you can hear a strong resemblance to the song Soil from Useless.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Fuck your dreams, I'm worried about ours
I will never go back to crowbars to cars
You could walk a million yellow bricks, never reach Oz
You could part the clouds, never see God
Metaphor to trying too hard to reach BONES
Except I'm really here, bring fear to your home
Me, I always hear, like my ear to the phone
So listen for the static, I'ma warn you in code
Think you'll understand if you see me up close, no
You can never truly know a ghost (Here we go)
(What?)
Talk slang on the corner but you don't (But you don't)
Speakin' down on the team, bet you won't (Bet you won't)
Take it easy, slow it down, let it go (Let it go)
Fuck it, maybe I feel the same, we'll never know (Never)
We'll never know how long I would have gone (Gone)
I would have passed on if I was still on backroads
If I was still on backroads, if I was still on backroads
Ride like McBride Arthur in his prime in the parry near the tides
Focus extra high so my gauge is always bright enough to light the path
And give directions to whomever brave enough
The chance nobody taken up, the one nobody dared to love
Don't become the thing you hated just because you're hating us
And that's just words from the wall, I awake, translate it all
Then I scrape the message offYou might also like9Embed

Lyrics:

[Verse]
Boy, I'm walking through the hall like I'm Dylan McKay
Brandon Walsh hair back, like we back in the day
I don't never talk to strangers 'less I'm bout to get paid
Steve Sanders lookin' boy, get the fuck out my way
Trying to use us' what you do, and don't say no thing
'Cause we heard about you and we don't like what they say
Don't let a couple co-signs fuck up your brain
Start actin' like something, give a fuck where you stay
Say you know about us, but you don't know no thing
Encapsulate me, go ahead, lock me in that frame
All I do is get confused by the fact kids still
Look up to the pussies that don't say what's real
I guess that's just how it is, I know that's just how it goes
Dirty nails, wrinkled clothes, Bones never with some clones
That's just how it is, I know that's just how it goes
Dirty nails, wrinkled clothes, Bones never with some clones

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Stand up straight just like a man
Be counted with all the rest
Work real hard and graduate
You need a well-deserved good rest
Find a job and find a mate
Settle down in a house in the suburbs
These are dreams they gave to you
I can feel when they're not yours
My skin peels like wallpaper
In the house that we don't go to anymore​

[Verse 2]
Feelings are far too radical
To ever see eye to eye
A mother's son was killed today
Only what she knows is why
Beheaded by hands of so-called faith
Maybe for a chance to live in the sky
Whatever the goal and point they saw it
I don't think that was the way to go about it
They don't see a way around it

Finally, I've come home, slipping off my shoes

Song Description: Track 9 of TeenWitch



Bones is telling the story of Columbine Highschool through a students eyes who was apparently standing out of harms way watching the event unfold. Very dramatic.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Drinking like I'm Julian, pull up to the school and then
Heard a loud pop, saw the students they were shooting at
Blood on the sidewalk, heart beating fast now
Thought it was a joke til I saw the TEC-9's out
Chalk outlines now, sounds of the crime loud
Helicopters, parents crying, fear is alive now
Body count raise as the cops sit and wait
Too scared to go in, maybe see their final day
The wind pickin' up, bodies getting laid down
Say the music, say the parents, but who the fuck's to blame now?
Nobody, no cops thinking "Hey, maybe, probably, we should go in the building, we could save a couple lives"
Fuck it, rather stay outside where it's safe
Hundred twenty minutes later now they 'bout to save the day
Tears of the town til my neck 'bout to drown
Head up, eyes closed, I don't wanna hear a sound

[Outro]
The breath in your lungs is the death of your son
It's the love of your life, it's the loss of your touch
The breath in your lungs is the death of your son
It's the love of your life, it's the loss of the touchYou might also like4Embed

Rip it then slip in your body bag
Shake it then dip and I'm out of there
Poppin' the drop and they got his ass
That don't concern me
I would be nothin' without the past
Drippin' it, whippin' it out the dash
I do this shit all without the mask
If you try to burn me, I will come back as a skull made of ashes
Dark shadow blunts smokin', exhale magic
Lookin' like Christ, I light with a passion
I will leave you and yours livin' off rations

[Chorus]
Switchblade on my dick, I'm rollin'
I ride with the team, they know this
Do the most tryna get the world to notice
They like mine, wonder why they don't like your shit?

[Verse 2]
Money in the bank (Bank), tens in my face (Face)
Wasn't in thе race, still I got first place (Place)
Brain full of hatе (Hate), blood full of dope (Dope)
Heart full of pain (Pain), blunt full of hope (What?)
(Shh) Keep it quiet for a minute
Tick tock go the clock at the drop of a penny
Thought you heard a creak in the floorboard denny
Poltergeist Bones checkin' neckin' with the business (What?)
Eject button, now you're out of commission
Long hair swingin' like one of my bitches
Off the dome, smooth, could've sworn that I picked it
I can dish it out, break it down, then fix it
Hardwood classic, the fit it say Pistons
Brown liquor sippin', lethal weapon I'm grippin'
Came up from the dark, now it's sunny, like Liston

[Verse]
For me there ain't no finish, I get it then I replenish
I get up and I go get it while you sitting in the dirt like
"How he do that, BONES, why you do that?"
Always high, never hiding
That knife, it hop off my body
I let it fly if you doubt it
It'll add some miles to your mileage, I make it go
But you knew that, but you knew that
It's the graveyard legend, they say that they independent
But they went and hired suits for business, booking, etcetera
It's the ultimate contradiction, I love how they got conviction
Result of false belief in self, it's time to hem up their britches
They swear that they're something different
It's time to hold up the mirror (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Let them see what there really is, what there really is
Let them see what there really is, (Wait) what there (Wait) really is

I need you to keep me leveled, I need you to come and save me
I want you to come and get me, I need you to fuckin' prove
Everything you said won't all be untrue
I'm down, that's just for you, it's all 'cause me, I knew
Exactly what would happen if you really had to choose
College in the winter, you're gonna leave soon
Tell me where I fit in just between me and you
Not tryna be the reason you gon' to hate me in the end
I'm not tryna be your friend, I'm not tryna be pretend
Fake words, real tears, know the story never ends
Every day another chance, you don't even fuckin' care
Put myself inside your hands, didn't know what that would do
Left me outside in the rain, gettin' dark, what do I do?
Deep breaths on the stoop, Backwoods gettin' smoked
All alone with my brothers, never catch me in the club

[Chorus]
Leave you all behind, I could start a-fuckin'-new
I could wake up every day and I could never think of you
I wish that you truly knew what the fuck you needed to do
Maybe shit would've worked, maybe then, I thought you knew

Show no respect for the planet, then look confused when it hurts you
Know I keep that 42 on me like my name Jackie Robinson
Know I keep my composure real calm, but deep inside it's apocalypse

Throw some trash in my grave just to prove it's the same
Twisting in space, do you choose to complain
'Bout the littlest minuscule shit, you stuck on that middle school shit

Years worth of hits, what you sittin' on ain't shit

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Got bored, made a million then I made another
SESH bring the storm, better run for cover
Bitch, I'm a rollie and a number one stunna
You'd stop when it's dark, I'm in this bitch till the sun up
Skeleton gang make 'em run like water
5.56 loaded up in the bullpup
Anywhere we go, people they know us
Don't you lie say you witnessed the come up
Bitch, you know BONES but you don't know Elmo
Def Jam Vendetta, stomping they shelter
Hell yes, I'm the man, are you? Hell no
Then address 'em with the blade, "Hi, how are ya?"

[Bridge]
I don't know what you've been thinking
I just want you here with me tonight

[Verse 2]
SESH on the rise, you know this, know this
When I'm on the block you notice, notice
Everything will be frozen, frozen
Play me, kiss you, Rollie, Rollie
Rock on your motherfuckin' hip, now stop
36 millimeter: my watch
Cold white man pimp on the drop
Best believe I am what you not
I'm focused
Bring the plague, you can hear the locust
Hundred spokes on the old school pokin'
My brain don't pause I'm dopin'
Choose up, fuck being chosen
One in the head, bitch I'm loaded
Fred Durst with the blunt, I'm rollin'
Twilight bitch, you know I'm zonin', zonin'
What?

And it be like that, till the line go flat, till the line go flat
And it be like that, till the line go flat, till the line go flat

[Verse 3]
SESH
Your so called "clique" full of pussies
Made my own path, just look where it took me
You by the book, we did it playing hooky
Talk your shit online, but never in person
Look me in my face, I dare you to push it
Red alert, now I'm on ya head like a turban
100 dollar J’s to the face, now I’m Irving
Spin the block silly, now your whole team nervous

In this song Bones is talking about how he doesnt really fuck with the world and he just keeps doing his own thing and he doesnt feel he differs from anyone else.

I aint nothing special
Lyrics:

[Intro]
"I do 50 push ups every night and it's not a sexual thing it's just push up's really"
"you are pulling at strings now"
"how many do you do a night"
"I do 50, I do a night"
"put that in the pipe and smoke it"
"I do not smoke"
"Shut up! your wife is harassing me now"
"C'mon man"

[Verse]
Keep my hands in my pockets
My words to myself and just keep this shit moving
The world can just do what they want
Shut they eyes say your prayer to the useless
Just like a human, get it then lose it
Converse about doin' but never go do it
I'm nothing special
More worthless than ever
100 woods now I'm deader
I could never be better

[Pre-Hook]
Everything different
And I'm the one to blame
Soon everything distant
I don't want to feel this way
Everything different
And I'm the one to blame
Soon everything distant
I don't want to feel this way

I shut out the world and I do what I do while I'm here
Nobody near the same when I look in the mirror
Seshin still
Espadrilles lifted with some drugs lit
Boomin like a drumkit
These other teams don't want shit

[Outro]
And that's a promise
And that's a promise
And that's a promise
And that's a promise
And that's a promise
And that's a promise
I know, I know5Embed

Lyrics:

[Verse]
Earth so fucked up, got me so fucked up, so I stay fucked up too
Gotta be on level playin' field when you takin' on the elephant in the room
The food is poison, don't drink the water
We are all pigs in a massive slaughter
Soon we will see what it means to tarnish
Winters gettin' colder, every summer gettin' hotter
Sweatin' underneath the rays, rollin' up watchin' the world end
Best seat in the house reserved for SESH, now start the whirlwind
Debris fallin', sirens callin' out to the world, no signs of stoppin'
Baller blockin', you get locked in a box to keep inside my pocket
Tell me, please what's the word now?
Everyone hopin' I slow it down
Fuck is up, you know it's goin' down
Feel like Yung Joc when I'm up in your town
Saw what you built and I burnt it down
Funny how smoke is a calming sound
The sizzle of nothing that once was a something
The transfer of matter turn you to a cloud

[Chorus]
Smoked
Rob your dreams and kill your hope, now you smoked
On the curb, like a joke, bitches know
What it do and what it don't, yeah it's BONES

Lyrics:

[Chorus]
I push 'em back, I lay 'em flat
You sendin' shots, motherfucker, I send 'em back
Your shit is wack, you will get packed
Smokin' thrax, bitches think I'm white trash

[Verse 1]
Looked in the mirror, I'm lookin' mad
So I turn your music on 'cause I really need to laugh
You twistin' fingers, you think you're bangin'
Better watch what you're claimin'
Bitch, you better watch your back
I could never give a fuck about no person tryna come for me
D-I-E, R.I.P. anybody steppin' up to me
Tombstone terrorist, headstone heathen
How you finna take me out when I ain't even breathin'?

[Chorus]
I push 'em back, I lay 'em flat
You sendin' shots, motherfucker, I send 'em back
Your shit is wack, you will get packed
Smokin' thrax, bitches think I'm white trash

[Post-Chorus]
One to the two, BONES comin' for you
Three to the four, better call your crew
Five to the six, better lock your shit
Seven to the eight, better hide your bitch (What, what)

Catch him at the red, make his wheels and his heart stop (Stop)
Lightin' up the blunt, hit the road when it's dark out (Ah, Ah)
Steppin' with the smart mouth, your dumbass gettin' stomped out (Ah, ah)
SESH on the tennis chain, Harley on the neck tag
Focus on my craft, you just buggin' 'bout your next bag
Whatever you dream of, you will never get that
You will never get far, pussy boy get back
Ash on my shirt, got blood in my eyes (Eyes)
Sound of the blade make him drop his disguise
S-O-S (S), never be the best (No)
You'll never be BONES, bitch, you'll never be
