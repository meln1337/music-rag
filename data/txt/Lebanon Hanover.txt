Title: Gallowdance
Release Date: February 28, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Lebanon-hanover-gallowdance-lyrics
Song Description: I am a bit convinced this song is about a suicidal couple both singing about hanging themselves. The line As disorientated as you can could mean the man in the relationship is addicted to alcohol or drugs, as  those things disorient your mind or vision.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Dance with me the gallowdance
As long as we, as long as we're not hanging
As long as we still can, my love
We both know the string is always ready

[Verse 2]
Dance with me the gallowdance
For all the degradation in this land
Dance with me the gallowdance
As disorientated as you can

[Verse 3]
Tanz mit mir den Galgentanz
Solange wir, solange wir noch nicht hängen
Tanz mit mir den Galgentanz
Solange wir, solange wir noch können

[Verse 4]
Der Baum, er steht schon lange da, mein Schatz
Er wartet nur darauf, dass wir uns trennen
Der Baum steht schon da, mein Schatz
Ein wunderschöner Baum, um sich zu erhängenYou might also like21Embed

Title: Alien
Release Date: March 4, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Lebanon-hanover-alien-lyrics
Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I like to wander some graveyards alone
And think of all that Iʼve become
What kind of box I would go
And would you even notice
My disappearance, my impressions
Iʼm just waiting, waiting...

[Chorus]
And until then my desolation
Will be my trademark
Iʼll always remain alien
And however hard I try to integrate
Iʼll always remain alien

[Verse 2]
You say I should go out
In every brutal town
There is someone of substance
Forcing me to do things I never do
For instance laugh at jokes of you
Small talks have simply no relevance

[Chorus]
And until you change
Iʼll keep my delighted face
It is my trademark to always remain alien
And however hard I try to integrate
Iʼll always remain alienYou might also like5Embed

Title: Babes of the 80's
Release Date: November 11, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Lebanon-hanover-babes-of-the-80s-annotated
Song Description: Feelings close to misanthropy, disappointment, lack of communication and trust in social and personal relationships are the main ingredients of this record, which are combined with the most wonderful melodies and the heavenly voice of Larissa. This song evoke a unique tenderness that overshadows the sadness, a power that takes us by the hand and leads us to the dancefloor. And this is the magic power of Lebanon Hanover, a band with a strong message towards/against society that makes us want to dance to its melancholy.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
These days it's crucial
To be silent and comfortable
The exploitation of humanity
They learned to accept it all
In my generation I will never fit in
I should be saint but I want to murder, murder everyone
[Chorus]
Babes of the late 80s, why are you looking so rundown?
Without posture there's no movement
In my pathetic age group there's confusion
Go and section us into a mental institution
Because we dreamed of a revolution

[Verse 2]
You would fantasize about the world elimination
I didn't agree but now I must say
At least you had imagination
People my age have no attitude
I should give in but I want to murder, murder everyone

[Chorus]
Babes of the late 80s, why are you looking so rundown?
Without posture there's no movement
In my pathetic age group there's confusion
Babes of the late 80s if you could put on a frown
How can absence be improvement?
Ooh well, in my age group there's confusion3Embed

Title: Sadness Is Rebellion
Release Date: September 28, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Lebanon-hanover-sadness-is-rebellion-lyrics
Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

You say nostalgia is negation
It can’t go on like that, it will all end
Contentment to be in nature
And kindness is still so hard to find
Sadness is rebellion
And self hate only respect

There is waves, waves of resistance
Somewhere out there, but there’s not enough of them
Those graves are such a temptation
If we don’t press rewind, it will all end

You say popular music is contamination
It won’t stop if the public is too blind
Sensitivity — almost a sensation
In a world of cruel and simple minds
May teardrops be our revolution
In confusion, we will connect

There is waves, waves of resistance
I can feel them but I never hear of them
There is waves, waves of resistance
The critical minds there is not enough of themYou might also like4Embed

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

People say they like me
But how can I believe
When they also like you
And you're exactly the one I hate
People sometimes say
That I'm quiet creative
But it's so confusing
They say it to you as well

I will stay forever alone
In my deep and dark thoughts
In the corner of the bar
Waiting for a good talk
And at some point, you ask me why
I'm the one with the saddest smile
I'm the one with the saddest smile

I might come across very disillusioned
But I do crossword searches all night
You're living your lives beneath the LCD light
Where real love serves you day by day

The lack of sensitivity in you
Is so ugly
So ugly
It makes you so ugly
So ugly
You're so ugly
So ugly

Lyrics:

With your hands on your ears, I see you reading
And it doesn’t even matter that everyone can see you
In you there is no masquerade, just purity and realness
From head to toe discrepancy, unlike anyone here

In you there is a fire, your warmth shines onto me
I bet you find bestsellers and crimes exactly as unreadable
In you I see a lighting, and if it struck me I wouldn’t mind
You're beautiful because you wear your dismay in your smile

In you there is no imitation, just a delicate strong mind
And with an attitude like that, I believe you can survive

In you there is a rose, to harm anyone, you're too shy
But your intentions of revolt are bursting inside
In you there is a darksome cloud with a very friendly vibe
A gloomy look is simply the most soothing in our time

With your hands on your ears, I see you reading
And it doesn’t even matter, that everyone can see you
In your face I see happiness, with a shimmer of decline
I bet your bookshelf looks similar to mineYou might also like2Embed

Lyrics:

True romantics don't kiss for fun
Even for a moment of monotone
True romantics are monochrome
Rosy echoes metallic groans
In a misty wood two rose buds
Always in mid bloom, mid bloom

Under one home two hearts making one whole

Title: Lavender Fields
Release Date: March 4, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Lebanon-hanover-lavender-fields-lyrics
Song Description: The narrator romanticizes the prospect of retiring with their significant other to a remote, rural area, where life is simple and traditions are alive, and the scenery is beautiful.
Confronted with the ignorant close-mindedness of city-dwellers, the narrator goes on to mock their dismissive rhetoric.
Lavender Fields is about longing for a place of tranquility wherein to live organically, where culture is not homogenized and the customs are pure.
Its also about the stupidity of those who, taking appearances at face value, dismiss this way of life as strictly uncouth and therefore unworthy.
Lyrics:

Over there at the lavender fields
Where the world's still full of purity
Won't someone please move in with me
This old farmhouse shall be our shelter

Oh but it's so hillbilly
So barbarian, so barbarian
Alone here I will drown in ignorance
They try to, try to break me
Tear me down into pieces
With their thinking of low capacity

Between wine yards and mulberry trees
Where the world's still full of clarity
It could be the best thing for our families
To grow a huge bewitched garden

Oh but it's so hillbilly
So barbarian, so barbarian
Our children will have this creepy accent
Creepy accent, artless accent
They try to, try to break us
Try to crush all diversity

An unbelievable ache
An entering of hell's domain
Where I freeze over

And when we lie in bed at night
It's so much easier to die

To fold to quiver

Lyrics:

Opening maps to see how far away we are
It's mental the distance that separates us
Space out with a coffee in your peculiar
Living room with a gathering charme
No women gather but you
Have a cigarette or two
You know it blows me away like a hard drug

Chain smoking heavy drinking is all I can do
So hard to find a person in life like you
It's everyday life we are used to it
But today it kills me that you're not in it

It is really a mess to see how grey things are
Collecting pictures and objects that unite us
Take me out to the most subvеrsive club
Of your giant sparkling city
I am gathering too
Scrolling through bootmarkets with you
It's cold turkеy from a very hard drug

Chain smoking heavy drinking is all I can do

Lyrics:

Entering the elevator from the second last century
You're living on the edge
Walking home alone down Zurich Longstreet
You're always living on the edge

Angst, German Angst
Always think of what's to come
Angst, German Angst
Surprises are so much fun

Monday morning, listening to The Cure
Living on the edge
Driving at a velocity of Steve McQueen
You're always living on the edge

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Perhaps an ideal way of life
Leads to an ideal way of death
It would be good to be you
But I'd rather be dead

Perhaps a fashionable way of life
Leads to a fashionable way of death
But to be in love is not in fashion anymore

[Chorus]
Let's move somewhere
Near the northern skies
And watch the northern lights
And watch the northern lights
Come, come into my arms
I want you in my arms
I want you in my arms

[Verse 2]
In a way it's just not very nice
To be around people with fashionable minds
Perhaps it's futile to speak when everyone is online
Alone with a couple hundreds of friends
With a couple hundreds of pills

Autofocus has brought a new disease
How can I focus full of

Throw it all in the bin
How can you work in

Title: Kyiv
Release Date: November 10, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Lebanon-hanover-kyiv-lyrics
Song Description: Bearing the name of Ukraines capital, Kyiv, voiced by Larissa Iceglass, delves into a narrative reflective of the sorrow and despair entwined within war-torn regions like Ukraine and beyond. The acoustic guitar and drum machine create a Cocteau Twins' Treasure-reminiscent soundscape, evoking a melancholic yet beautiful auditory journey. Iceglasss voice, transitioning from her husky baritone to a more resigned lament, embodies a poignant reflection on the harsh realities faced by those embroiled in conflict-ridden landscapes. The narrative exudes a collective empathy towards the suffering, underscoring the arbitrary geographic lottery that delineates the vastly disparate human experiences. Accompanied by a somber trumpet, the song paints a vivid picture of despair while also serving as a call to arms, urging collective empathy and togetherness to traverse through the harsh realities of this life.
