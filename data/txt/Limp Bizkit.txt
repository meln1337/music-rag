Artist: Limp Bizkit
Artist Description: Limp Bizkit is a Nu-Metal group, formed in 1994 in Jacksonville, Florida, and consisting of Fred Durst, Sam Rivers, John Otto, Wes Borland, and DJ Lethal.

They have released 6 studio albums and one EP, with 3 compilation records and a remix album, New Old Songs. Two of those albums went number one, and it’s estimated they have sold over 50 million records worldwide.

Notable for their bridging of the gap between hip hop and metal, Fred Durst can be considered a rapper and a singer. Their collaborations with Method Man and Snoop Dogg solidify their street cred, and a high profile beef with Eminem only places them further into hip hop culture.

The band has been nominated for 3 Grammy awards, and 3 American Music Awards. Wes Borland was listed in the Top 100 Guitarists by Ultimate Metal, and his live performances consist of weird costumes and funky get-ups.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It's just one of those days when you don't wanna wake up
Everything is fucked, everybody sucks
You don't really know why, but you wanna justify
Rippin' someone's head off
No human contact, and if you interact
Your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!
It's just one of those days

[Chorus]
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talkin' that shit

[Verse 2]
It's just one of those days, feelin' like a freight train
First one to complain leaves with a blood stain
Damn right, I'm a maniac, you better watch your back
'Cause I'm fuckin' up your program!
And if you're stuck up, you're just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!

My suggestion is to keep your distance

We've all felt like shit and been treated like shit

And if my day keeps goin' this way

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies
[Chorus]
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

[Verse 2]
No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty

Song Description: The lead single off Significant Other, Nookie is the bands first big hit, reaching the top 10 on the Rock and Alternative charts and crossing over to pop at #80 on the Hot 100. It was also a top 40 hit in Australia and The Netherlands.

In Nookie, Fred Durst is complaining about a bad relationship. He told MTV:

Its about my ex-girlfriend, how she treated me like shit, and I couldnt leave her, wouldnt get over it. She screwed my friends and used me for my money. I tried to figure out why I did it, and I figured I did it all for the nookie.

According to Urban Dictionary, nookie is defined as:

Something you get from someone that is sexual or loving in nature. This word is slang for an action, not a body part. (sugar, action, hooking up, kissing, hugging, sexual activity, etc).
Lyrics:

Should I be feelin' bad? (No)
Should I be feelin' good? (No)
It's kinda sad, I'm the laughin' stock of the neighborhood
And you would think that I'd be movin' on (Move it)
But I'm a sucker, like I said, fucked up in the head, not
And maybe she just made a mistake
And I should give her a break, my heart'll ache either way

Release Date: May 30, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-take-a-look-around-lyrics
Song Description: Limp Bizkit drops a banging track, slamming on the critics with no remorse, while also grappling with the moral dilemma of how his fame has brought these sharks into his life, and how all the hate in the world has made them into haters. The song also appeared on the Mission: Impossible 2 soundtrack, while the riff itself is a new spin off of Lalo Schifrins Mission: Impossible theme.
Lyrics:

[Intro (Video version only)]
"Mr. Durst?"
"Yeah?"
"We need your help. Pulling into the diner about now should be four top-secret agents. One of them is carrying a briefcase. Your mission is to obtain the disc from the briefcase."

[Verse 1]
All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin' up the world today
When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'ma live my life like I should (Like I should)
Now all the critics wanna hit it
Ya shit can how we did it, just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from these critics
But do we always gotta cry?
Do we always gotta live inside a lie?
Life's just a blast that's movin' really fast
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid? So what you wanna do?
And where you gonna run when you're starin' down the cable of a
Mic pointed at your grill like a gun?
Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set
It's like Russian Roulette, when you're placin', you bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and you're done
'Cause I'ma be the one 'til I jet (I'ma be the one 'til I jet)

[Verse 2: Fred Durst]
Does anybody really know the secret?
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it?
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason (Everything happens for a reason)
I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fists
And everybody wanna run (Wanna run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (Hide from the gun)
You can take that ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take the edge off the knife (No, sir!)
And now you want your money back (Money back)
But you're denied 'cause your brain's fried from the sack
And there ain't nothin' I can do
'Cause life is a lesson, you learn it when you're through
[Pre-Chorus]
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

[Chorus]
And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!
And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

Now I know why
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)

'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

[Verse 1: Fred Durst & Method Man]
Who could be the boss? Look up to the cross
Stranded in the land of the lost
Standin' up, I'm sideways
I'm blazin' up the path, runnin' on the highways of rap
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
A lotta stamps and brands, we like a bar code
I'm bashin' all the media strikes to keep the media dykes
As reinforcement for the fight
And that alone'll keep John Gotti on the phone
I'm tangled in the zone, I got the bees on the track
Where the fuck you at? (Tical!)
Let me hear you pigeons run ya mouth now (Shut the fuck up!)
I'm pluggin' in them social skills that keep my total bills
Over a million the last time I checked it
Thank God, I'm blessed with a mind that'll wreck it
Wait until the second round and knock 'em out

[Verse 2: Method Man]
They call me Big John Studd, my middle name Mud
Dirty water flow, too much for you thug
They can't stand the flood – what up, doc?
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd,  the sureshot
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged (learn!)
Temperatures too hot for sunblock (burn!)
Playin' wit' minds that get you state time
Locked behind 12 bars from a great mind
Killa bees in the club wit' his ladybug
Brought a sword to the dance floor to cut a rug
Love is love all day, 'til they throw slugs
And take another life in cold blood, can't feel me 'til its your blood
Murder rates tremendous, crime is endless
Same shit different day, Father forgive us
They know not what they do, all praise is due
I'm big like E-Z and Big Bambu

What's that? I didn't hear you
Shut the fuck up!
Come on, a little louder!
Shut the fuck up!

[Verse 3: Method Man with Fred Durst]
Headstrong, dead calm, Dead by Dawn
Dead weight, they dead wrong, let's get it on
Twelve rounds of throw down – who hold crown?
Protect land wit' four pound, Limp Bizkit
Get around like merry-go, bust a scenario
Comin' through your stereo, why risk it?
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
Eight essential vitamins and minerals, delicious
Word on the street is, they bit my thesis
Knocked out they front teefes, tryin' to taste mine
Actin' like they heard it through the grapevine
Dope fiendin' for the bassline, to provide rhyme
Pharmaceuticals, hard as nails to the cuticles
Where'd you find that monster? She beautiful
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit, roll on the set
Kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, and then jet
[Verse 4: Fred Durst & Method Man]
Mic check, so what's it all about? And where we gonna run?
Maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised for the blood of virgin eyes
We limpin' on the track with the Method
So get the sunblock, you gettin' one-shot
Until you dissolve, I revolve around everything you got
From outta nowhere, prepare, you be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare, now you're turned into stone
Without a microphone, but don't you forget you're in a zone
So shut the fuck up, and take that shit back
'Cause all your shit's wack (Doo doo is doo doo)
When its weighed out like that
Burnin' up your brain like a piston
So all those that didn't listen
Never even knew what they were missin'
And never even knew that the sky was fallin' down
Wu-Tang-Clan for the crown

[Chorus: Method Man]
What's that? I didn't hear you
Shut the fuck up!
Come on, a little louder!
Shut the fuck up!
Everybody in together now
Shut the fuck up!
What, huh?
Just shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up!
What's that? I didn't hear you
Shut the fuck up!
Come on, a little louder!
Shut the fuck up!
Everybody in together now
Shut the fuck up!
What, huh?
Just shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up!
[Outro: Method Man]
It was over your head – all day, every day

Wu-Tang Killa Bees
And the Limp B-I-Z-K-I-T
Y'all know the time, y'all know the rhyme
It ain't easy bein' greazy in a world full of cleanliness
And, you know, all that other madness
We gone, peace!
Limp Bizkit, Method Man
Rock the house y'all! Bring it on!

[Hidden Track]
Hey wait up, where you guys goin'?
You're not recordin', are you?

But I'm all alone
I can't do this!
Feel it, uh
Feel it, feel it, feel it
You guys feel it out there?
Shake your head if you feel it
Hey, hey, hey
Every day is brighter than the next day
At least that's what you think
Every day is brighter than the next day

For all the ladies in the cave to get your groove on
And maybe I'm the one who flew over
The cuckoo's nest, but guess who's next? (Who)

Release Date: September 30, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-dad-vibes-lyrics
Song Description: Dad Vibes is a song by Limp Bizkit released on September 30, 2021, as the lead single from the bands long-awaited sixth studio album, STILL SUCKS. It was Limp Bizkits first official release since 2014s Endless Slaughter.

Fans first got a taste of the new track at Lollapalooza in Chicago on July 31, 2021, when it played over the PA system at the end of their set. It was then that Fred Durst, in his dad look that soon went viral, jumped offstage and started handing out t-shirts to festivalgoers.

Dad Vibes was released through Suretone Records, a label set up by former Interscope/Geffen Records CEO Jordan Schur, who has a long-standing business relationship with the nu metal band.

The song is credited to Fred Durst, Wes Borland, Sam Rivers and John Otto, with Durst also listed as producer along with Purps and Zakk Cervini.

Smell up the bathroom like Craig pa was in it
Endin' up on your back, Wu swords up in it
Anyone can match me, I crack 'em all to Guinness

Title: Livin’ It Up
Release Date: October 17, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-livin-it-up-lyrics
Song Description: Living it up is the 7th song on Limp Bizkits magnum opus album Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water. Like many Limp Songs, its another loud braggadocious Nu Metal anthem where Fred raps about livin it up by pouring out his heart and soul into the microphone. Lyrically Fred makes numerous pop culture references such as actor Ben Stiller who at the time made a cameo in the Rollin music video (and also appeared on the outro of the album) as well as Pop singer Christina Aguilera, who Fred made a surprise musical appearance during her setlist at the 2000 MTV VMA awards. Durst also cites watching the movie Fight Club roughly 28 Times, and while not being a smoker he apparently  loves the  smell ofwell a certain green plant.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
(Life in the fast lane)
This is dedicated to you Ben Stiller
You are my favorite motherfucker!
I told you, didn't I?

[Verse 1]
Drama makes the world go around
Does anybody got a problem with that? (Yeah)
My business is my business
Who's guilty? Can I get a witness?
First things first
The Chocolate Starfish is my man Fred Durst
Access Hollywood, license to kill
A redneck fucker from Jacksonville
Bangin' on the dumpster funk
My microphone machete's in the back of my trunk
Rocker's who's steady with the he says, she says
And don't forget about the starfish navigation system
Don't hate me, I'm just an alien
With thirty seven tons of new millenium
Dum-diddie-dum, where's it coming from?
Mrs. Aguilera, come and get some!
Oh no, which way to go to the dance floor?
It's on my stereo, pay me no mind
I seen The Fight Club about twenty eight times

And I'm 'a keep my pants saggin'
Keep a skateboard, a spray can for the taggin'
And I'm 'a keep a lot of girls in my band wagon

[Chorus]
(Life in the fast lane)
I'm just a crazy motherfucker livin' it up

(Life in the fast lane)

[Verse 2]
Take two, hoo-haa!
Now who's the star sucker? I'm the Starfish
You silly motherfucker
Puff puff, give the marijuana cig, oops
I don't even smoke, but I love the way it smells
Here's a toast to the females
Sippin' lung champagne from a seashell
I think I gotta feel and pop his ass like a zit
With the starfish navigation system
I'm no cheap thrills, baby
Fill the briefcase with three dollar bills
I'm just an ordinary run of the mill fella
Spittin' out hella' mic skills
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm 'a keep my pants saggin'
Keep a skateboard, a spray can for the taggin'
And I'm 'a keep a lot of girls in my band wagon
'Cause I don't give a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane

And it's so easy to run and hide (Life in the fast lane)
But it's not easy to be alive (Life in the fast lane)
So don't be wasting none on my time!

[Bridge]
This world is like a cage, and I don't think it's fair
And I don't even think that anybody cares
It'll leave a hole (What?) down the side of me (What?)
And it'll leave a scar (What?), can anybody see? (What?)
That we gotta get it out (We gotta get it out)
We gotta get it out (We gotta get it out)
We gotta get it out (We gotta get it out)
And I'ma get it out with the motherfuckin'
Microphone plugging in my soul
I'm a renegade riot getting out of control
I'mma keep it alive and continue to be
Flying like an eagle to my destiny
So can you feel me? (Hell yeah!) Can you feel me? (Hell yeah!)
If you feel, motherfucker, then you'll say (Hell yeah!)
Then you'll say (Hell yeah!)
Hell yeah, I'm livin' life in the fast lane!
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause it's so easy to tell a lie (Life in the fast lane)
And it's so easy to run and hide (Life in the fast lane)
But it's not easy to be alive (Life in the fast lane)
So don't be wasting none on my time!

[Chorus]
(Yeah, bring it on!)

Title: Ready to Go
Release Date: April 16, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-ready-to-go-lyrics
Song Description: Limp Bizkit signed to Birdmans Cash Money Records in 2012, and this was the result of that signature, a collaboration track with Cash Money veteran Lil Wayne. It was claimed to be a single for their much-delayed album Stampede of the Disco Elephants. The budget extended far enough for a video to be recorded, featuring live footage and a rare appearance from Weezy.
Lyrics:

[Intro]

Yo! Boil up!

Come on, back it's the motherfuckin' Rock-God

You know, the one to have Britney droppin' to her knees
I don't give a fuck, I probably never will
Bitch, get at me if that ass is like Jessica Biel's
Who down with me tonight? You know, I'll treat you right
You shake for me until they turnin' on them ugly lights
Throw them fingers up, and finger-fuck the sky
She like the way we pump it, I call her pumpkin pie
I ain't about to lie, I came up in it high
You got a problem? I'll bust you in your fucking eye (player!)
"Baby, you're a rockstar!", I know who the fuck I am

Release Date: June 22, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-re-arranged-lyrics

The song is about how dishonest Freds ex-wife has become in their relationship and doesnt shy away from saying that they are basically over for all of the things shes done
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Just think about it
Just think about it
[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been skeptical, silent when I would use to speak
Distant from all around me who witness me fail and become weak
Life is overwhelming, heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down

[Chorus]
But you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition, I'll remember when I'm letting go
Of you and me, we're through and rearranged

[Verse 2]
It seems that you're not satisfied, there's too much on your mind
So you leave, and I can't believe all the bullshit that I find
Life is overwhelming, heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to, disappoint you when I don't fall down

[Chorus]
But you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition, I'll remember when I'm letting go
Of you and me, we're through and rearranged
You and me, we're through and rearranged

You're no good for me
Thank God it's over
You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're crying
And you make believe
That life is so long until you're dying
You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're crying, crying on me
You make believe
That life is so long until you're dying, dying, dying on me!
You think that everybody's the same
I don't think that anybody's like you
(You ruin everything and you kept fucking with me)
You think that everybody's the same (Thank God it’s over, and I won’t be the same)
(You ruin everything and you kept fucking with me)
I don't think that anybody's like you (Thank God it’s over, and I won’t be the same)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Looks like I'ma do everything myself
Maybe I could use some help
But hell, you want somethin' done right?
You gotta do it yourself!
Maybe life is up and down
But, my life's been what 'til now?
I crawled up your butt somehow
And that's when things got turned around
I used to be alive, now I feel pathetic and now I get it
What's done is done, you just leave it alone and don't regret it
Sometimes some things turn into dumb things
And that's when you put your foot down

[Chorus]
Why'd I have to go and meet somebody like you, like you?
Why'd you have to go and hurt somebody like me, like me?
How could you do somebody like that? (like that)
Hope you know that I'm never comin' back (never comin' back)

[Verse 2]
Looks like I'ma do everything myself (everything myself)
Maybe I could use some help
But hell, if you want somethin' done right
You just do it yourself! (Got it?)
Maybe life is up and down
But, my life's been what 'til now? (Got it?)
I crawled up your butt somehow (Got it?)
And that's when shit got turned around (Got it!)
I used to be alive – so pathetic, well, now I get it

Depending on you is done
Giving to you is done
No more eating, no sleeping, no living
It's all just more giving to you and I'm done
Depending on you is done
And giving to you is done
No more eating, no sleeping, no living
It's all just more giving to you and I'm done
The hiding from you is done!
The lying from you is done
No more eating, no sleeping, no living
It's all just more giving to you and I'm done

Title: Counterfeit
Release Date: August 26, 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-counterfeit-lyrics
Song Description: Counterfeit was the lead single off of Limp Bizkits debut album, Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$.

Some controversy was met with the promotion of this single though, the bands label, Interscope, paid a Portland radio station $5,000 to ensure that the song would be played 50 times; opening and ending the song with an announcement saying that Interscope paid for the airplay. The strategy was met with criticism from all areas, despite the fact that it really didnt increase sales.

Counterfeit is the 3rd track on Limp Bizkits 1997 album, Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$

This song is according to Wes Borland, They saw this little thing we built and they were like, Oh, lets get baggy pants and dress like kind of hip-hoppy and, you know, play heavy metal and rap. five or six bands just popped up out of nowhere that became these, you know, groups that were trying to sound like us. It was ridiculous. Thats where the song Counterfeit came from.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Flobber Fairy, you know we've figured you out
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a fake

[Verse 1]
Hey man, wake up and smell the concrete
Strange to see you've changed, like the LB
Could be identity crisis, but I can't buy this
Reality bites but that's what life is
Pitiful you, your hideous behavior
Hate what God gave ya, fakin' all the flavor
Artificial minds seekin' out the new trends
Get in where you fit in
Quit thinkin' like a has-been diggin' in my culture
I'ma let me let your punks know I'm an old school soldier
With the funk flow, a damn shame wanna change yourself
Because you're sick of yourself, well I'm sick of you too!

[Verse 2]
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder what it's like to be a clone
Doin' nothin', nothin' on my own
Alone in your misery, you're bitin' on my new style
Filed as a counterfeit goin' down in
History as nothin' but a copy cat
So if you're fakin' that you're phat, you need a ballbat
Right where your head is at
All your desperation causes separation
Now I grab the mic to intimidate
Your weakness screams from the limp on your siren
Phonies get the hint quick smacked with the funk-flick
Pain for the fakers fame can't maintain
Because you're sick of yourself, well I'm sick of you too!

[Chorus]
Fake! You're a counterfeit!
Fake! You know we figured you out
Well I'm sick of you too!
Fake! You're a counterfeit!
Fake!
All these phonies...
[Verse 3]
You disregarded your life
You disrespected your friends
You've even stolen your appearance
From hangin' around with my family
But I should have never dropped my guard
So you could stab me in the back
But you were freakin' me out
Just freakin' me out, you wear a mask

[Refrain]
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit!

Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit!
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit!
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit!

[Bridge]
Now you're steadily startin' to change
You wanna re-arrange your lifestyle, live like the wild child
With the vibe alive, you could lie to try and be so fly
A lie but you deny you're a fake!
[Outro]
You're a phony, you know we figured you out, fake!
You know we figured you out, figured you out, figured you out!

Song Description: This was from before Eminem had a beef with Limp Bizkit. Durst recorded this song for the album Significant Other with Eminem, but the collaboration was left off the album. The song contains samples of Turn Me Loose by Loverboy. http://www.whosampled.com/Limp-Bizkit/Turn-Me-Loose/
Lyrics:

[Intro: Fred Durst and Eminem]
Uh
Aiight
Check
Slim, Shady, through the mic kid, Uh
Slim Shady, Oh

[Verse 1: Eminem & Fred Durst]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
Get a slipped disc from a Limp Bizkit disc
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
Little rich kids in cribs don't attempt this shit
So step back while I primp up to pimp this bitch
So I say to the girl, I'm like, "What up, girl? Shut up, girl!"
Then showed her a cut up squirrel
She screamed bloody murder so loud everybody heard her
Slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
I moved on to two blondes kissin' on a futon (Ayo, baby! What are you on?)
I looked at 'em both and I was like, "Look
Check this out, toots, I'm lookin' for Cookie Puss
I need to speak to him immediately
They played my video on MTV last week"
And just when I was thinking I was all that and then some
In comes Fred Durst: Yo Shady, let me get some!

Who knows what galaxy I came from?
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare, you stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
See, me and Shady, I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound, I got you crusin' with your top down
These two blondes I offered them both a drink
And this you would think could get the party started
But instead them girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouth, smelled like somebody farted
So it was time for me to move on
Shady said the living room was a dance floor
So turn me loose, I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was a drunk and a prick
Rambling on about how he was gonna kill me, wow!
I spilled a drink on his shirt
But no, he insisted we should go
And before I could drop him, Shady had to clock him
The music stopped, the party stood in shock
I looked around, grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf

[Chorus: Fred Durst]
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's going my way
Or no way at all
Why don't you turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's going my way
Or no way at all
Why don't you...
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Turn me loose
You better tell them to come reshingle the roof
Just keep feeding me free drinks 'til I puke
Then Fred will ask me to lead sing in his group
I'm sitting at the bar and I'm not being approached
‘Cause Fred's over there stealing all of my hoes
"Yo, Fred, save me some"
I walked up to these Siamese twins
And asked to have a threesome
I told 'em, "Two heads are better than one
Plus, I respect how y'all roll together as one"
Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
Stood up, like, "Hey, wait, where are you going?!"
Oh well, three strikes and I'm out
And I just struck out two times in a row (Ouch!)
I ain't trying no more, fuck it, I'm chillin'
Did a shot of Jäger, fell asleep on the ceiling

[Verse 4: Fred Durst]
Who knows what galaxy I came from?
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare, you stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
See, me and Shady, I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound, I got you crusin' with your top down
These two blondes I offered them both a drink
And this you would think could get the party started
But instead the girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouth, smelled like somebody farted

Bumped into this dude who was a drunk and a prick

Title: Stuck
Release Date: July 1, 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-stuck-lyrics
Song Description: Stuck is the 4th track on Limp Bizkits debut studio album Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$. The song was part of the mini-concert Bizkit performed for fellow nu-metal band Korn in order to go on tour with them for the Family Values tours in 1998 and 1999.

The songs lyrics describe a crazy woman, possibly label owner Kathleen Tobin who tried to sign them before they joined Flip Records, who keeps harassing the band. Durst has had enough and threatens her to stop.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Psycho female blowin' up the phone line
You need to tighten that screw, it's been loose for a long time
I've been slammed with some bad luck
Soon I'm gonna bring you doom with the buck-buck
And now you duck, duck, goose, I'm letting loose
With the 30-ought freestyle labeled hostile by my profile
Must be all the madness, you and all your tactics
Jonesing for my cash, got to make them pockets super fat
Hey I'm a humble man kicking out my jams like a tramp
I'm gonna stick it like a stamp to this business
What's with all the business?
I get paid to take the microphone and slay the stage
Stay away from all the bros in my band and all the fans
And all my friends when the cash is coming in
Or I'll be slamming them balls to the wall
With the ink on my flesh to the 'yes, yes y'all!'
No 9 to 5, I'll still survive
I keep my engine on that amp like a Chattanooga champ
That's all we need, another bad seed
Planted on this Earth motivated by greed

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna play that game, bitch!?
You take a dash for my cash, it's your ass that I'm blasting
Boy, you wanna play that game, bitch!?
You take a dash for my cash, it's your ass that I'm blasting
You're bad luck, you're so... stuck!

Stuck! You're so, you're so, you're so

[Verse 2]
All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi
Far from suicidal, still I get them tendencies
Bringing back them memories that I really miss
When I reminisce rocking back in the 80s
Live my attitude to do or die!
Once I was a maggot but now I'm just Super Fly
Bound for the boundaries, no limit G
Fat ass rhythms driven by my destiny
Your style's in my pocket
Proclaimed to regain that essence
Pressin 'cause I'm hostile, labeled by my profile
Indeed I am, I am indeed hostile when it comes to greed

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna play that game, bitch!?
You take a dash for my cash, it's that ass that I'm blasting
Boy, you wanna play that game, bitch!?
You take a dash for my cash it's your ass that I'm blasting
You're bad luck, you're so... stuck!

Stuck! Deep down in that hole again!
Stuck! Got your brain on my green again!
Stuck! You're so, you're so, you're so

Title: Gold Cobra
Release Date: June 7, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-gold-cobra-lyrics
Song Description: Gold Cobra is the title track from Limp Bizkits sixth studio album, released in 2011. This marked a reunion of the original band members, including guitarist Wes Borland, who mysteriously departed from the group after the groups 3rd album dropped in 2000.
The song deals with Fred Dursts fame causing envy among his rivals, and displays feelings of superiority and entitlement.
With changing music technology, this song, and the rest of the album, use more electronic techniques than the raw-sounding Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$ and Limp Bizkits older records. Examples of this include the guitar riffs inspired by air raid sirens.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, ah, check this!
Kid (come on!)
Check this! (Fuck you!)

[Verse 1]
Wakin' up, aggravated
Stupid shit, man, I hate it
Bitches lyin', bitches cryin'
Suicidal, get in line
Gettin' mine, bouncin' freaks
Losin' sleep, countin' sheep
Absolute, cash and loot
Man in black, packin' heat
Born and blazin', rotten raisin'
Fingers up, time to wave 'em
Show these players playin'
That they better get their ass to prayin'
They won't be nothin' but dice
After the cuttin', I'm guttin' 'em
Like a fish, they're gonna wish
They never pushed my button

[Pre-Chorus]
The door is shuttin' and a knock will do you no good
You're gettin' nothin' while I rock here in Hollywood
I'll tell you somethin' else, you can take it to the bank
I don't give a fuck what none of y'all people think

Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra

[Ad-libs]
Oh, that's right!
Yeah, that's right! (shut the fuck up!)

[Verse 2]
Feelin' Korn, goin' blind
Free as hell, doin' time
I'm insane, can't complain
Flush you turds down the drain
Down the hatch, throwin' craps
Throwin' matches on the gas
Check the math, check the wheels
Check the ride, pay the bills
Burnin' miles, harder smile
If you're feelin' versatile
Verses wild, flippin' bitches
Grindin' trucks, skatin' ditches
Hatin' hard, but hardly hatin'
Knife and slice your shit like bacon
Sick and tired, you is fired
I'm the truth, and you's the liar
[Pre-Chorus]
The door is shuttin' and a knock will do you no good
You're gettin' nothin' while I rock here in Hollywood
I'll tell you somethin' else, you can take it to the bank
I don't give a fuck what none of y'all people think

[Chorus]
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra

There's only one king on this hill, it sure as hell ain't you
Oh yeah, listen what I'm tellin' you (I'm telling you)
There's only one king on this hill, it sure as hell ain't you (yeah!)

Title: Show Me What You Got
Release Date: June 22, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-show-me-what-you-got-lyrics
Song Description: A song by Limp Bizkit which the lyrics imply that Fred is thanking all of the pros and musicians that have helped him and his band get this far into music.

Fred Durst also makes callbacks to other songs on the album and to his 9 yr old daughter (at the time of this release), Adriana.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Keepin' it real, world wide, baby
Limp Bizkit's in the house, so bring it on!
I'd like to dedicate this song to you
For makin' my dreams come true, for the millennium
Are you ready? Then get the fuck up!
Who's hot, who's not?

[Verse 1]
Where you at, Jacksonville, Rochester, Louisville
Columbia, Hartford, Milwaukee, and Lewiston Maine?
Where you at, Providence, Nashville, Memphis, Lauderdale
Portland, Orlando, Chicago, and Frisco?
I left my heart in Austin with Mary Campbell
Got lost in Boston, lookin' for the tea party
Met a child molester in Worcester
I need a Kleenex every time I'm leavin' Phoenix
I get silly when I play in Philly
Limp Bizkit committee down in Kansas City
Never know what I'm in for when I'm play in Denver
Hard Rock don't stop down in Vegas
In Cincinnati the girls call me Daddy
And I probably ain't leavin' the next time I'm in Cleveland
Found my lucky coin in Des Moines
And spit on a boy named Tina in Pasadena
We get to swing from New Orleans, Fort Worth, and Dallas
We toast when we're tippin' up the Challis
Tulsa, St. Louis, Sacto, Mesa
Norfolk, Lawrence, Minneapolis, St. Paul
North Hampton, Detroit, Omaha, New York, LA
What can I say? I can't name 'em all
So somebody, anybody, everybody
Get the fuck up!

Show me what you got! Wooh, ah!
Show me what you got!
Hey, ladies!
Who's hot, who's not?
Who, who?
Who's hot, who's not?

[Verse 2]
I can't help but to believe in these friends
These bands, these stories, and the places that I've been
I thank God, Mom and Dad
Adriana for the love I feel inside
Jordan, my phat ass band
Without 'em I'd be nothin' but a pumpkin shoved inside a can
Without the fans, there wouldn't be no show
And if that was really so, then life would really blow
To the firm, you always got my back
Korn for the love and the swappin' of the tracks
My brother Cory D., my man Terry Date
We brought it to the plate and you made it sound great
Scott Weiland, the melody man
If you can't sing it, then nobody can
Wu-Tang-Clan, skills from the Method
The world's best MC kills on this record
Slim Shady, the crazy ass cracker
Staind, a brand new drug for your brain
Les Claypool, for actin' like a fool
And all of the bands for the demos that were cool
I'm so grateful for this life of mine
The ones I didn't thank – I will some other time
Now I just want somebody, anybody, everybody
To get the fuck up!
[Chorus]
And show me what you got! Wooh, ah!
Show me what you got!
Hey, ladies!
Who's hot, who's not?
Who, who?
Who's hot, who's not?

Who's hot, baby?

You've come to take me under
And I've forgotten all about me

Then I would never need what you gave me and never need you to save me
And never feel like this life is over
If there's a better place you can take me, a better life you give me
Whatever place I can start all over
Then I would never need what you gave me and never need you to save me
And never feel like this life is over, feel like this life is over

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yuck!
Uh, uh, uh, drop that shit
Straight coming at you
Punk

[Verse 1]
To criticize is critical when digging on my concept
Rhythms keep on building like the smog
Got you running from the law
Maybe it's that low-end smothered with the freestyle
Maybe it's the thought of being on the bottom of the pile
Styles bound to the skylines
Keep 'em on the sidelines choking on my fly rhymes
You need the Heimlich maneuver
This ain't no joke, you're gonna choke
When I'm slinging it to you

[Pre-Chorus]
When did you decide (When did you decide?)
To be narrow in your mind? (When did you decide?)
When did you decide?

[Chorus]
I'll probably never understand
(The pollution)
You preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
(The pollution)
I keep the grip real tight on the mic when I spill
(The pollution)
You preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
(The pollution)
I keep the grip real tight
See Limp Bizkit LiveGet tickets as low as $86You might also like[Verse 2]
Breaker, breaker 1-9, spitting out that skill
Suicidal funk let me know you're real
I'm walking on a thin line with the sticky bass line
Now you're stuck with the flow running through your mind
So when you're crossing over, let me know you're real
Put that flex on your neck, now you got the feel
Rumble like the thunder, now you're going under
Makes me wonder what the fuck is even going down
I listen to 'em stereotype, when they complain
I can't refrain from bringing on the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
When did you decide (When did you decide?)
To be narrow in your mind? (When did you decide?)
When did you decide?

[Chorus]
I'll probably never understand
(The pollution)
You preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
(The pollution)
I keep the grip real tight on the mic when I spill
(The pollution)
You preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
(The pollution)
I keep the grip real tight
[Break]
(That's it, that's it)
Ain't nobody doin' like... you

[Bridge]
So when they tell me to turn down that volume
I'm gonna bring that beat back
And when they tell Sam to turn down that bass
I'm gonna bring that beat back
And when they tell me to turn down the vocal
I'm gonna bring that beat back
And when they tell us to shut the fuck up
I'm gonna bring that beat back!
Yeah, gonna bring that beat back!
Whoa, gonna bring that beat back!
Fuck, gonna bring that beat back!
Yo, yo, yo, yo J bring that beat back!

[Pre-Chorus]
When did you decide (When did you decide?)
To be narrow in your mind? (When did you decide?)
When did you decide?

[Chorus]
I'll probably never understand

You preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
(The pollution)
I keep the grip real tight on the mic when I spill

You preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear

Gonna bring that beat back!
I'm gonna bring that beat back!

I'm gonna bring that beat back

Beat back, so shut the fuck
Whoa!

Song Description: The song is about the the end of the 20th century, the song was also featured in the trailer for The Fast and The Furious
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Bring it on!

[Verse 1]
Fame - you're claiming is the top of the world
This stage - I'm claiming is the top of the world
And love - I'm feeling when you people connect
And if you're out in the crowd, you're getting more than respect
And if you're wondering, I got plenty of flows
I'm making plenty of friends and many of foes
But as the audience grows, security knows
Stopping me now is kinda serious

[Pre-Chorus]
No use in dreading what they call Armageddon
I think we made it through the slump
But who really cares where we're heading?
'Cause now you motherfuckers got a reason to jump!

[Chorus]
So lets make something out of it, this way we can all relate
Worldwide, we collide, this is how we communicate
So let's make something out of it, whoever thought we would see the day?
I can't believe we did it, so let's drift away

[Verse 2]
Hate -  a feeling I don't really get
And hate - can get you in some serious shit [muted]
Time - is something that may change me
But I can't change time, so fuck it!
I've been stumbling through these thoughts
And about the fact that I could be delirious
But as the audience grows, security knows
Stopping me now is kinda serious

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Scott Weiland]
You keep your distance, I can't deny you
I got the feeling, can't satisfy you
I got your picture on the wall
I got the picture long gone
You keep your wishes, I'll keep my feelings
There goes another one that kept me breathing
I'm waiting for you, I know you're leaving
I'll still adore you, you never need me

[Chorus: Scott Weiland]
Hold on, I've found another way to let you go away
Hold on, you've found another way to bleed my soul away

[Verse 2: Fred Durst]
The things you told me, to hear you speak
I'm burning slowly, I'm growing weak
You bring me closer to yesterday
Yesterday's a million miles away
Why can't you hear me, why can't I sleep?
And I don't understand what keeps me breathing
I'm waiting for you, I know you're leaving
I'll still adore you, you'll never need me

[Chorus: Scott Weiland & Fred Durst]

Fuck Limp Bizkit, man! Jesus...
"Ooh, I can put a Z in my name, I'm bad!
I'm never gonna move out of Jacksonville
I'm livin' in fuckin' Hollywood," huh
Hmm, you know this is my first, uh, rock slash rap album
So, it's kind of new for me, the whole pop world, you know
This is a phat beat, by the way, and I'm talkin' P.H. phat
Thank you, uh, to, uh, DJ Lethal for this phat beat
Did you grow up with DJ Lethal, Fred?
Y'know? *laughing*
And did you call him DJ Lethal when you were kids?
(That's his name) That's what his mama named him, huh?
Ooh, little DJ Lethal
Can't mess with Limp Bizkit, 'cause we get it on every day and every night
So, back it up, you know what I'm sayin'?
What, you don't like Limp Bizkit?
What? No no no, I think Limp Bizkit is great, man!
What do you like about us?
Um, I like that you're so fuckin' out there with your message
Uh, you know, "Shut the fuck up, man!"
Watch out, mom! Big bad rock star
Are you serious?
"Ooh, I can slash your ass with a chainsaw!"
No, I'm just saying
The message of being able to slash someone's ass, that's a good message to put out there
And with a chainsaw, we're gonna get it down raw or whatever
You know what I'm talking about? You know what I'm talking about, right?

And would you pay?
Are you gonna pay money to listen to this record?
This record? Which one, this one?
You mean, uh, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water? Haha!
So yeah, cut the beat and let's start this shit up, ok?
Come on, shut the fuck up, and start this shit up
It's all crazy thrash, punk, pop, metal to you
But it's somewhere out there in the annals
You know, up there with Rod Stewart and, uh, uh
Uh, Rod Stewart is the Bizkit, man
I mean, I'm talkin', when you're limpin' with the Bizkit
You're talkin' about the major groups in rock 'n' roll
Who else could take rap, hip-hop, thrash, punk-metal
Take it, throw it in the can, spin it around
And come out with something that wasn't fertilizer?
And it was the Bizkit, the Limp Bizkit, man
And when they came on the scene, I don't care what you say
"Counterfeit" blew the fuckin' people downtown!

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Dead from all the loneliness and this is how I feel
Understanding everything has never been my deal
Maybe you have crossed my path to live inside of me
Or maybe you're the reason why I'm losing all my decency
[Chorus]
But I believe that you and me, we could be so
Happy and free inside a world of misery
And I believe that you and me, we could be so
Inside of you, inside of me, 'cause this could be the one

[Refrain]
This could be the one
This could be the one
This could be the one

[Verse 2]
I've been lookin', lookin', lookin', I've been lookin'
I've been lookin' for my Mrs. Right, but she don't exist
Chemistry is everything, and we're anything but this
Maybe I have crossed your path and sweep you off your feet
Or maybe I'm the reason why you cry at night before you sleep

[Chorus]
But I believe that you and me, we could be so
Happy and free inside a world of misery
And I believe that you and me, we could be so
Inside of you, inside of me, 'cause this could be the one

If you never try, then you'll never know
The grass could be greener
And it will always be greener on the other side
But you just never know
(This could be the one)

[Chorus]
But I believe that you and me, we could be so
Happy and free inside a world of misery
And I believe that you and me, we could be so
Inside of you, inside of me, 'cause this could be the one

If you're alone, I know why
If you can hide, then go hide away
But I want you to stay, hey
And blow me away, away
I want you to stay and blow me away, away
If you're alone, don't you cry
If you can hide, then go hide away

Should've left my pants on this time

Rumble the earth with my lowered suspension
Just watch the ground move, let the sound prove

The Bizkit's limp when the night is over
We shake the whole place, make this earthquake
And it ain't fake when we start the riots
Rock the bells, psycho females
Doing time, blowing up the phoneline
Call it a stampede, coming to your town
We ain't gonna hold back, we're coming to get down

And break it on down 'cause you're pumping my band up

Time to elevate my quality of life on down the road

[Intro]
Who's the man? (the-the-the, the man in the middle)
Who's the man? (the-the man, the-the man in the middle)
Who's the man? (the-the man, the-the man in the middle)
Who's the man? (who-who, who's the man-man-man?)

[Verse 1]
When I reminisce, ignorance was bliss
Back in the days where the magic exist
Never be the same as it was, 'cause the way it was
Just another day in the maze of a myth
Had a lot of fun livin' life on the run
Never had chance to pause to get a better glance
Everything was free and everything was fast
Never even thought it wouldn't last
When you got the mind of a man in the middle
Life is just a big fat riddle, so figure it out
Always thinkin' that you know every little thing there is to know
But you don't really know, you know?
It's like love, some people get it
For some it's just a glove that just never fitted
For me, it's just a pain in the ass
But I'm addicted to the taste of hopin' it could last

[Chorus]
Another day, another night inside a lonely world
Another game, another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong, another right inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world

Who's the man? (who-who's the man?)

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm a target for people that are bitter
At least I can say that I've never been a quitter
I remember high school, man, I hated high school
It was like prison with bullies always puttin' me down
Just a little skater-boy they could pick on
I learned to forgive 'em, now I got the balls they can lick on
I loved sneakin' out when my mom was asleep
With my Gothic girlfriend makin' love in the creek
With the mind of a man in the middle
It could be the end of the world as we know it
Still, I never want it all and I never want it now
I just wanna cruise, if I lose, then I'll figure it out
How the times files, even with the blink of an eye
When you're young, you absorb like a sponge in disguise
Then you get a little older and gather your thoughts
It's was amazing what you learn when you've never been taught, you know?

[Chorus]
Another day, another night inside a lonely world
Another game, another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong, another right inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world
[Bridge]
No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world
No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world (Such a lonely world)
No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world
No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world

Another day, another night inside a lonely world
Another game, another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong, another right inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world

Who's the man? (In such a lonely world)
Who-who's the man? (In such a lonely world)
Who-who's the man? (In such a lonely world)
Who-who's the man... (In such a lonely world)

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I ain't no joke, so you should get a pen
And write yourself a little note so you don't forget again
That when it comes to cash, I've been gettin' smoked
Lendin' out my money, now I'm broke
Somebody's gettin' choked, 'cause now it's time to pay the piper
Bums are the type of shit that's in a diaper
Don't make me have to call a sniper
And wipe your brains off my windshield wiper
You dirty bug, as soon as I get paid they come in masses
There's someone givin' classes on kissin' people's asses
Unless you're livin' where the trash is
Don't even come around here askin' where my cash is

[Chorus]
Me? I'm broke!
Me? I'm broke!

[Verse 2]
I ain't no joke, I'll say it once again
And if I get provoked, there'll be knuckles on your chin
Some people never learn – borrowin' from me? You might regret it
For one, I ain't no bank and you got shitty credit
As soon as I get paid, they're comin' out the woodwork
Take your ass and get a job, like you should, jerk!
Unless you're livin' where the trash is
But you're not, so find another spot where the cash is

Release Date: October 17, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-getcha-groove-on-lyrics
Song Description: Anyone know why the beat has changed in latter productions of the album? Did they lose the rights to it or something?
Lyrics:

[Intro: Xzibit]
Yes, millenium shit
Limp Bizkit, ha, X to the Z, yeah, ha
Bringin' it live to you and yours
Ladies and gentlemen, ha, ha, ha
My homeboy, yo, get at 'em, dawg

[Hook: Fred Durst & (Xzibit)]
You don't wanna fuck with me today
'Cause a little somethin'-somethin' didn't go your way (yeah)
So, try not to be like that today
'Cause I'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way (come on!)
We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place
We're only givin' a fuck, if you're evadin' the space
So getcha-getcha groove on (gotta getcha groove on)
Don't keep us waitin' too long (don't keep us waitin' too long)

[Verse 1: Fred Durst]
Don't you treat me like a toy kid, do you enjoy this?
Every single second I'm alive, I'm a mess (yeah)
Got these laser-beam mic checks
Communicatin' through the Genelec
High-tech, keep you on the run now
Don't wanna be that guy, every single second I'm alive
I'm alive, I don't understand why
I got control, full of candy in your soul while
Pumpin' up the sweetness, this is what you need
Another little piece of me inside of you
'Cause you know that I always keep it true (keep it true)
And that's exactly what I do, it's what I do
Yeah, it's what I do

Me and Limp prolly twenty percent (damn)
Your little half-ass, direct hits ain't even makin' a dent
What an event! All hail Xzibit and Limp

I got untapped material, I serial-kill shit
Give me the real shit, X, finish 'em all quick
Makin' your jaw split when I'm touchin' the mosh pit
Constant conflict, knockin' faggots unconscious
Hypnosious, raisin' the stakes, increasin' the weight
Got homies I can lay down that lift they plates
So quit tryin' to evade my space
Before I call for a face to face, and gotta rest my case, like

[Verse 4: Fred Durst]
This is how we do it, just recognize (uh-huh), we keep gettin' right to it
Look into these eyes (yeah), look into these eyes
And you'll see the size of the flame (whoa)
Then you might despise the size of my game
Step the fuck back, Xzibit's on the track (what up?)
You should've buckled up before your head hit the dash (yeah)
You gotta hate that, a demo from an eight track (yeah)
Brought me to a place, where platinum comes in eight stacks, bitch

'Cause a little somethin'-somethin' didn't go your way (what up?)
So, try not to be like that today

Title: Faith
Release Date: October 31, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-faith-lyrics
Song Description: Limp Bizkit first brought attention to themselves with this nu metal reinvention of George Michael. Understandably his reaction wasnt the best:

What weve heard from George Michaels people is that he hates it and hates us for doing it. He apparently really despises it.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like me
But I got to think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play 'cause I play them too
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
When that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby, but I'm showing you the door

[Chorus]
Well, I gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!

[Verse 2]
Baby I know you're asking me to stay
Say please, please, please, don't go away
'Cause you're giving me the blues
Baby, your mind made all the word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy blues
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you pick my heart up off the floor
When our love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby, but I'm showing you that door

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'm standing here on the ground
The sky above, it won't fall down
See no evil in all directions
Resolution of happiness
Things have been dark for too long

[Chorus]
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing
For me
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing
For me

[Verse 2]
I found a love I had lost (I had lost)
It was gone for too long (For too long)
Hear no evil in all directions
Execution of bitterness (Bitterness)
Message received loud and clear (Loud and clear)

Release Date: June 28, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-get-a-life-lyrics
Song Description: Get A Life is the fifth song on Limp Bizkits 2011 album Gold Cobra.
 Its lyrics mostly focus on how cool Limp Bizkit is, in particular front man Fred Durst, and how everyone else should stop criticizing them and get something else to do.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Fred Durst]
Check it out, it's the outlaw, white dog
Often called by my alias, "Polar Bear"
Brain tied like the S&M freak shit
Cold like the ice you're servin' up my drinks with
Stick shift, fuck the automatic
Rollin' up in third gear, guess it's just a habit
And all you freaky bitches reachin' out to grab it
Don't hesitate, 'cause you can have it, I'ma stab it
Demolition came to crush the mission
Just in time for you maniacs to listen
And it 'ain't nothin', 'cause don't think it's serious
My flow is cold like the weather in Siberia
I keep your head bobbin', like a novelty
And all them turkey emcees wanna gobble me
But I'm a shark in my underground fish tank
And I don't give a shit what those motherfuckers think
B-Boy with a taste for the metal
A taste for a fine rhyme and I ain't gonna settle
If you don't like it, you can scratch up on these nuts, bitch
Polar Bear ain't a cracker you should fuck with
Buggalo, shinin' like a diamond
Momma went and bought a kid a mic, now he's rhymin'
And now he's hated, 'cause everybody played it
But they're just hatin' 'cause I motherfuckin' made it

You don't wanna see what I can do with a knife
You don't wanna be my enemy, I promise you

[Verse 2]
Ah, hell, let me tone it down
Pour me up another double shot of the Crown
Get this party hoppin' when I step into your town
I came to boogy down, 'cause I don't give a fuck
I don't ride in limos, 'cause limos make me carsick
I ain't goin' out like the Dancin' With the Stars shit
I don't wait in line 'cause I'm always on the guest list
Anywhere I go, always leavin' with the best bitch
And all my boys get the pick of the litter
That girl you came with, I suggest you forget her
North Carolina is my homeland
I'm homegrown, just a cackalacky mofo
A redneck who never had a dollar
Now I'm makin' people all around the world holla
Hit and now I'm hated, 'cause everybody played it (yeah)
But they just hatin' 'cause this motherfucker made it

Don't let the world bring you down, down
Don't let the world bring you down, down

Make a sucker-jump straight out the window
Keep it, get low, kid, that's for shit flow
Like an asshole, bitch, it's official
Polar Bear, bustin' up the Endone
Make a sucker-jump straight out the window
Keep it, get low, kid, that's for shit flow
Like an asshole, bitch, it's official
Bring it on!

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Everyday is nothing but stress to me
I'm constantly dwelling on how you got the best of me
Wanna know something I can't believe?
The way you keep testing me and mentally molesting me
Would you think any less of me if I said that I'd be there?
Would you think any less of me if I said I really cared?
Of course you would, 'cause you only want what you can't have
As for me, I'm stuck with my dick in my hand because

[Chorus]
You don't feel nothing at all
You don't feel nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Maybe there's more to life than it seems
I'm constantly running from reality chasing dreams
Wanna know something I can't believe?
Just how much misery comes with humility
Do you think any less of me now that I'm gone?
Look at me now, everything is gone
I can't seem to do anything right
But I figured out why you don't let me inside because

You don't feel nothing at all

You said, you said

Title: Nobody Loves Me
Release Date: October 29, 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-nobody-loves-me-lyrics
Song Description: Nobody Loves Me is the second single and fifth track from Limp Bizkits debut studio album Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$. It was released along with the album on July 1, 1997, then as a single on October 9, 1997. The song was influenced by rock band Tool, and Durst has said that he tried to imitate Maynard James Keenan on the song. Tool also influenced the rest of the albums sound as well.

Nobody Loves Mes lyrics are mostly a complaint from Durst, who reports that he doesnt get the credit he deserve and that sometimes it seems like the world is against him.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Shut up

(Go away)

[Verse 1]
I'm so sick of them deadlines
I understand why them maniacs are hitting them headlines
And even though I don't know ya
Through my lyrics I'll show ya, the sanity's over

People say I'm bugged out
See, while I'm in the field, you're in the dugout
My business, stay the fuck out
All I know is that the beat goes on
And will be the same till the day I'm gone

[Chorus]
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
Nobody loves me, nobody owes me a thing
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
Nobody loves me, maybe I'll go eat worms

[Verse 2]
I'm so sick of the world now
It's all these people bag on my identity
Now I'm the enemy running out my mouth again

Now what's the matter with this?
Someone's sure to find me
No exceptions for this
So many times I fall through
No one has ever warned me
Life seems so meaningless
Whenever it gets at your inner strength

Oh, I'm such a piece of shit
So perfect

So much better than me

Title: Sour
Release Date: March 17, 1998, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-sour-lyrics
Song Description: The 6th track off of Limp Bizkits 1997 album Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$ was inspired by Dursts issues with his then girlfriend.

Though a video was shot for this song, it was never released as an official single off of the bands album.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Mellow out!
Bitch
Lay low...
Lay!

[Verse 1]
I thought I knew you, took the time to throw my love into you
Screw you, 'cause now you got me sitting in the sewer
I'm through with all them roller coaster rides
See, I ain't forgot about the knots that you've been tying with my insides
I dropped my pride, without you I was sure to die
I tried with cash and all I could to make it last
Now I accepted that was in the past
I know you love me, love me like a piece of trash

[Verse 2]
But at first, you were so sweet
Couldn't go without seeing your face for an hour, so sour
It all became a hassle, you were even living in my castle
Just to use me and verbally abuse me
That's not the way I'm running my shop
It took a while to see the light before I stopped
And you got dropped off; it's over, probably I'll be sweating it
But in the long run, you'll be the one regretting it
Maybe you won't, maybe you will
But baby, you're still about as real as a three dollar bill

With all that anger that I'm feeling, bitch, I think it's heat
Another split tail, just another split tail
Thanks for the lesson, now get your shit and hit the trail
We know I'm coming from the old school, you damn fool
Intensity is something that I'm made of
And certainly I'm not afraid of a little smack in my face
Thanks for that taste

Overlook the aftermath
Make my tears be your bath

I'll keep buildin' till I die

Stretch it out over seas
To the end of the world

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yo, what up?
Got Christian and Dino in the house
Fear Factory action
We kick off this new joint here for all my homies

[Verse 1]
Separating the true breeds from my friends and my family
Had a vision with no bounds, now it's blowing up
Props to the Field Dog
With the vote to the campaign, gold records and champagne
Everlast for the tour on St. Patty's
Chino, man we had a blast with your Deftones
Rock them microphones daily
Props to the maestro, Ross you're an angel
Hey DJ, wanna play that song?
Lethal, we love you like a brother
Wanna take a trip to the flip side, Jordan?
Nothing more than I can say, see you walking hand in hand with the Prophet
Danny, you took us to that fat man
Harry, Tyler props for the golden introduction
We're coming from the town of the unknown
Jacksonville's on the map

[Chorus]
Look us up, raising eyebrows with the Jaguars, kid
Better watch out
Line 'em up, Cheetah

When I walk out on stage, all headaches go away
Got the back from the sickest road crew
Chris and Bobby for sticking to it
Sugar Ray taught me life was all about drinking
Bow Wow, yippee yo yippee yay
To the funk, Doobie, thanks for showing up
All my brothers in Korn I love you
Dad and Momma, I'm coming home

[Outro]
What up to my girl Sage, Shaun, Teddy Swoes

Title: The Truth
Release Date: May 2, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-the-truth-lyrics
Song Description: The song explains that although the truth is not what we want to hear, it is the smartest path to take to just accept it.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You can't sleep, you're restless
And slightly obsessed with falling too deep
And malfunction, you're a virus
Whose intention is fucking up something
You're a crater
On the face of a problem much greater
It's the violence or lack thereof control
Body and soul, digging a hole
Is the blood stainless?
Enjoy the pain with accepting the grief
Are you finished?
Dumb fucking question, don't let yourself fall asleep
Resurrect the intention
Once your vision is now mass-produced
Imagine the insult's a blessing
Imagine accepting the truth

[Chorus]
Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth
(Hey!) Imagine accepting the truth
(Hey!) Just imagine accepting the truth

The pendulum's swinging
Hypnosis is taking control, now you linger
On a shadow of doubt
Have you really figured what you're all about?
Don't trust your instincts
Just open the chamber where you keep those darkest regrets
All the things you've done wrong
Rebellious at heart all along
Is your leader a voice?
Somehow you've replaced all your gain with a debt
Now the payback's a bitch
Why owe your life to a bitch?
Absolutely pathetic
And regret it when told you are made of mistakes
Imagine that insult's a blessing
Imagine accepting the truth

[Chorus]
Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth
(Hey!) Imagine accepting the truth
(Hey!) Imagine accepting the truth
(Hey!) Imagine accepting the truth
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
[Post-Chorus]
(Now speak to your leader)
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
(Now speak to your leader)

Deliver us from evil, deliver us from evil
Your Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name
Deliver us from evil, deliver us from evil

Deliver me from evil, deliver me from evil
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name

Title: Pill Popper
Release Date: October 31, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-pill-popper-lyrics
Song Description: Pill Popper is the 10th song on Limp Bizkits long awaited 6th Studio Album Still Sucks. It features a heavy industrial metal type sound and more political lyrics regarding the Pharmaceutical Industry. The overall message of the song can be found in the opening monologue: The pharmaceutical industry does not create cure, they create customers, with Durst singing/screaming about a patient addicted to the medication intended not to treat them of their ills but to hook them into being an addict and paying customer for life. Durst once stated before a life performance of the song in 2022 in Norfolk Virginia that it is heavily influenced by one of his favorite bands: Ministry.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Thank you, Kenneth
It's no secret that our governments have fostered
A culture of corruption
In which special interest and big donors advance their interests
At the expense of everyday people
The pharmaceutical industry does not create cures
They create customers

[Verse 1]
Time to take my medicine
Got a cocktail in my fist
'Bout to lose my head again
I just feel like freakin', yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woe is me
Only one way to paradise

[Chorus]
Gimme my medicine
Gimme my medicine

[Verse 2]
Gimme my medicine
Pills give me a smile
A smile so genuine
But the thrill only lasts a while
So I'll pop me a pill again

[Verse 1]
Hey kid, who you lookin' at?
Why you standin' all up in my face like that, huh?
You ain't never seen a baseball bat?
A maniac knockin' on your baseball cap?
You better step about ten paces back
Or you'll be layin' where your shoelace is at
Go do what your momma told you
And don't be actin' like a punk, thinkin' you're a soldier
I see yourself got a cell phone
I got a number you can dial son, make it 9-1-1
Tell 'em "Stop at Hef's house on the way" kid
"Pick up some playmates but only if they're naked"
Don't know how y'all do in y'all's city
But 'round here, we're gettin' down to the nitty gritty
And I hate to put you out like that
But you've been burnin' like a fire with a mouth like that

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me back to yesterday
Rollin' dice and getting laid
Everything was a-okay, oh
But now and then, a cloud rolls in
Rains on my parade and then
Talkin' this and that again, oh

Let's break it down for a minute
And roll it on up in third gear for a minute
I got the 21's rubbin' on my Benz, and
I got girlies in the back seat rubbin' on my friends, and
I don't really give a fuck about
What these player-hatin' pussies give a fuck about
'Cause I'm a night ranger, never been a stranger
My two-way pager is lookin' for some danger
Zoolander, hit you with the magnum
Everybody get your groove on, if you have one
And if you ain't got it, then admit it:
It's Limp Bizkit, time for you to get it
All around the world in this 45 Prévost
Everywhere that we go, we watch it on the TiVo
And now you're layin' in the bed you made
Drinkin' Haterade, think about it

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me back to yesterday
Rollin' dice and getting laid
Everything was a-okay, oh
But now and then, a cloud rolls in
Rains on my parade and then
Talkin' this and that again, go
Leave

I've got news for you (All radio is dead)
So you're thinkin' that you're all that and then some?
Man, I got news for you (All radio is dead)

[Verse 3]
Let me guess, you ain't that impressed
Mr. halitosis of the breath
Livin' lifestyles of the wish-you-would
From the back isles of the thrifty-good
See, I got room to talk, kid
I've been layin' this track since North Cack-a-lack
And the very first day that you fell out the sack
I was in some phat laces, spinnin' on my back
Let me think, let me roll, let me ride
Let me put some funk in the trunk with a vibe
And a memory that can ease your pain
Like a melody from Kurt Cobain
'Cause ya never know when it's all gonna end
And ya never know when you'll call on a friend
So you better take a step to prepare yourself
'Cause the way you're livin' now ain't good for your health

[Chorus]
Thinkin' that you're all that and then some?
I've got news for you (All radio is dead)
So you're thinkin' that you're all that and then some?
Man, I got news for you (All radio is dead)
Thinkin' that you're all that and then some?

Hey, it's the bald man and I'm here to tell you why the new Limp Bizkit album is so important
That's because CDs like this one spare you from all the chart-topping, teeny-boppin', disposable happy horseshit that brings up the bile from the back of my neck
I have no time or tolerance for old shitty wack acts like that
I wouldn't piss on their CDs to put out a fire
And I'm tired of all those lame-ass, tame-ass
Pre-fabricated, sorry excuses for singers and musicians
Who don't even write their own songs!
What the world needs now is a musical revolution
We need some rock, we need something that has balls!
We need something with substance, depth, something with soul, some edge, some passion, some power
Shit, if it's gonna be mellow, fuck, man
It better have something, it better mean something!
I'm telling you, you gotta hit 'em with something hard
You gotta stick em' with something limp, like Limp Bizkit
I'm so fucking tired with that shit that I'm hearing on the radio
Radio sucks!
The same fuckin' songs over, and over again!
All the weak ones, all that disposable crap that isn't gonna matter in 3 months, it's just shit! It's crap, Fred!
Fred, I'm telling you there's nothing but shit goin' on, and we need some new music
W-wha- What about Limp Bizkit?
Limp Bizkit is fuckin' cool, you guys are cool, the new record's great!
But fuck all that other shit! I'm so sick of all that weak shit that's takin' up space on the charts
Fuck that shit, Fred! I'm outta here!
Fuck, dude, fuckin' Pinfield is pissed!
Oh man, I gotta go find that bald bastard
Hey, Matt! Matt!
[The Mind of Les]

[Verse: Les Claypool]
Hit me!
Firecracker!
So there you go
Fifteen of your hard-earned dollars right out the window
Most expensive piece of plastic that I've ever come across
Fifteen dollars
Fifteen dollars on a shoddy piece of plastic
There it is, Limp Bizkit in all its glory
Fred Durst, the man, the myth, the compulsive masturbator
You love him, you hate him
You love to hate him
Hello! Hahaha!
Once when I was afraid to speak
When I was just a lad
My poppy gave my nose a tweak
And told me I was bad
Then I learned a brilliant word
Saved my aching nose
The biggest word you've ever heard
And this is how it goes
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Ah, those were the days!
I don't know
You got any more of that?
I'm smokin' 'em in a minute...
So, what did you think
You were getting a Celine Dion record?
No, no, no young bucky!
You laughed, you cried
You just kissed your fifteen bucks goodbye
Limp Bizkit, I don't think so
Fred Durst, I don't know
But what the hell, I got paid
Goodbye now!Embed

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Learned how to rap as a little boy
Took a lot of crap as a little boy
Always had to fight back as a little boy
Always under attack as a little boy
Never got good grades as a little boy
I was locked in a cage as a little boy
Still, I never was afraid as a little boy
I was feeling my rage as a little boy
It's time to blow their minds

[Verse 2]
Learned how to lose as an older man
Sang a lot of blues as an older man
But I saw it all through as an older man
Put together my crew as an older man
Felt a lot of pain as an older man
I established my name as an older man
People piss on my game as an older man
Ain't nothin' gonna change as an older man

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time to blow their minds now, baby
It's time to blow their minds now, baby
I'm on my grind now, baby
Y'all know it's my time now, baby
Come on!

Who that is? What it say?
Who that is? What it say?

[Verse 3]
Got treated like a clown as a little boy
Kept my feet on the ground as a little boy
When you're living in a dream as a little boy
Ain't nothin' like it seems as a little boy
I was hatin' on the world as a little boy
I was lovin' all the girls as a little boy
I was into punk rock as a little boy
I was breaking non-stop as a little boy
It's time to blow their minds

[Verse 4]
Got treated like a chump as an older man
Mixing rock with the funk as an older man
Learned what a girl was as an older man
Now I know how to love as an older man
But I'm still a big kid as an older man
And I'd much rather give as an older man
Still I'm singing in the rain as an older man
Ain't nothin' gonna change as an older man
[Pre-Chorus]
It's time to blow their minds now, baby
It's time to blow their minds now, baby
I'm on my grind now, baby

My life is one big dream, I'm lost in what it means
Don't wake me up 'cause it's almost over
These voices in my mind keep tellin' me it's time
To wake me up 'cause it's almost over

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time to blow their minds now, baby
It's time to blow their minds now, baby
I'm on my grind now, baby

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I woke up feelin' like I need to get out of the house right now
I'm feelin' like goin' downstairs, take a deep breath
The whole world just might be endin' today
Get it together, stay calm, stay calm
How am I supposed to stay calm?
Poor little kid, momma ruined his brain
Why am I livin' this way? Why?
'Cause I'm a loser, I was always told that
Now I'm a loser and I love it, I fuckin' love it!
I love it 'til my brother's just a puddle in a bucket
And everyone around me, they all die and they say, "Fuck it"
Why is huh, pourin' all of my feelings through your head
And I ain't gonna settle 'til that shit reaches your fuss

[Chorus]
And now you're on your ass, and now you're on a ass
Knowin' you ain't listenin' to shit 'cause you an ass
Life ain't gonna sneak up on your ass and take a bite
It's gonna take that life back, baby, it's life
Life is a bone in the battlefield
Girls, boys will learn to kill
On with the endless slaughter

[Verse 2]
Yeah, born in hell, givin' you all my time in hell
And I love it, oh no, no, I'ma go psycho on this hoe (psych!)
You're a sad lawless whore doin' this war inside out for?
You want war, get in sync, now I love it more!

[Interlude]
All I know is I'll never know
All I know is I'll never know
You cannot take this away from me
This is the one thing you cannot take away from me

[Bridge]
I am no longer under you
You are the one who is under me now
I am no longer under you
You are the one who is under me now
I am no longer under you
You are the one who is under me now
I am no longer under you
You are the one who is under me now
The one who is under me now
The one who is under me now
[Verse 3]
Whoo! Took a lotta time, time with the chance
Gonna put these motherfuckers on the floor, so they can dance
I'ma need a little kimchi, take a pump, load it up
Throwin' it in the back with the jaguar loaded up
Been drinkin' muff since the 1819
How 'bout goin' meet us in the back on the ninth green?
Pussy hole never made a tootsie roll, give a shit
Clean up in this bitch just like a bag of gold, here we go
Oh my God, it's that white rapper guy
That white Leo tellin' everybody Gemini
That's me, I'm the Leo on the flo'
Baby girl, tell me your sign before you go
'Cause I'm about to chip it in the hole like bubba
Hope I don't bust another hole in the rubber
'Cause I ain't got another baby name I could use
Maybe Tom Cruise, I'm about to hit Dre to fix

[Outro]
So, what you really know about that?
Probably nothin', you ain't know about nothin'-nothin'
You got somethin' to say, then say it
If you gon' say it then fuckin' say it
I ain't afraid to look you in the face
What you gonna say? What you gonna say when I'm in your face?
Tell me, boy, what you gonna say when I'm in your face?
I'ma grab a dirty fork and jab your eyes out1Embed

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Fred Durst]
All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin' up the world today
When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'mma live my life like I should (Like I should)
Now all the critics wanna hit it, ya shit can how we did it
Just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from these critics
Do we always gotta cry (Always gotta cry)
Do we always gotta (Always gotta) live inside a lie
Life's just a blast that's movin' really fast
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
Follow me into a solo
Remember that kid, so what you wanna do
And where you gonna run
When you starin' down the cable of a mic
Pointed at your grill like a gun
Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set, it's like Russian Roulette
When you're placin' your bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and you're done
Cause I'mma be the one till I jet (I'ma be the one till I jet)

[Hook]
I know why you wanna hate me...
I know why you wanna hate me...
I know why you wanna hate me...
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!
And now you wanna hate me!
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

Does anybody really know the secret
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason (Everything happens for a reason)
I don't even know what I should say
Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fists
And everybody wanna run (Wanna run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (Hide from the gun)
You can take that ride through this life if you want
But you can't take the edge off the knife, no sir
And now you want your money back (Money back)
But you're denied cause your brains fried from the sack
And there ain't nothin' I can do
Cause life is a lesson, you learn it when you're through

[Hook]

[Verse 3: E-40]
I knew this wasn't gonna be big for me (Big for me)
So you won't have to be distract back act bad and spit dispiritment
Let me reinvent myself, let me introduce my name
E-40 man, the baller to the king of Spain
Doin' a gig, spit em' a jig
Reckless while I'm with Limp Bizkit
Flossin' and bossin' sometimes I get
Doin' my thing this-a-ma-jig
Jewelry cuts, I preach just what I practice
They wanna cut my head off like John the Baptist
The end change, money change the way people think about me
When I was broke they used to laugh and talk bad about me
Why ya wanna playa hate on me
In the streets most overrated, duplicated
Orientated, up-to-dated, game invested
Sucker free vested, just measued and interested
How to request it, game collector, well connected, y'all digest it
Timbaland did this beat and kicked his feet, for real
[Verse 4: Eightball]
Yeah, you a hater, hater, hater
That's OK hater, you gon' see me later
I get around like Pac from coast to coast
Where I'm gonna be next only God knows
Life flows, I'm a Southern poet, playa
That's OK hater, you gon' see me later
Close ya eyes and look past the bullshit
Ya rap's like a knife boy I got a full clip
Mind blown from all the doja I've blowed
Gotta have just to deal with you weak hoes
I'm on a crusade for everything hip-hop
Gangsta reality and I won't stop
Come to my world and deal with what I deal with
Cotton candy rappers win over real shit
That's the real shit
Take it how you want
Eightball's a real playa
Don't need a hater1Embed

In your empty ass home with the motherfucking sawed-off?
Pop off the rock ship, pop, pop, p-pop off the rock ship
What you gonna do when you're sitting all alone
In your empty ass home with the motherfucking sawed-off?
Pop off the rock ship, pop, pop, p-pop off the rock ship

My nose running like me from the police
It's been three weeks, and I ain't got no sleep
Now I'm chilling where the players and the hoes be
With two broke ass hands trying to roll weed
All because I pop, pop, pop off the rock ship
You might know a lot of things, baby, not this
And I'll do it all again for you, watch this
As I limp my ass back to the cockpit
(C'mon) Now start it up, (C'mon) let the engine roar
And all the people in the moshpit scream for more
(Yeah!) Yeah, they scream for more! (Yeah!) So light it up
'Cause the way we live our lives seems right to us

[Pre-Chorus]

And I can't remember yesterday that well
Hell I can't remember when I slept that well
I told this girl I've been fuckin' to get my bail

You probably heard it all before, baby, not this
Here's a shout to you ladies with the hot tits
Courtesy of Limp Bizkit on some rock shit

But I gotta think twice, before I give my heart away
Cause I know all the games you play (what?)
Cause I play them too baby

Oh but I need some time off, from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
When our love comes down, with that devotion
Gonna take a strong man baby, but I'm
Showin you that door, cause I gotta have - faaaiith
(uhh, ya gotta) Faaaiith
(do ya feel it, don't stop) Faaaiith
(uhh, yes yes y'all, gotta have) Faaaiith
(ya don't stop; one, two)

Baby (uhh) baby (uhh) baby, uhh
I know you're askin me to stay
Say "Please, please, please don't go away
Because I'm givin you the blues (blues) baby (uhh) baby (uhh) baby" uhh
You like me, but all them words you say
I can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to the leather board please

Before this weather, becomes that notion
'Fore you pick my heart up off the floor
When our loves come down, with that devotion
Gonna take a strong man baby, but I'm
Showin you that door, cause I gotta have - faaaiith

Title: Everything
Release Date: July 1, 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-everything-lyrics
Song Description: Everything is the thirteenth and final track of Limp Bizkits first album, Three Dollar Bill, Y'All$.

This song lasts for 16 minutes and 27 seconds, which makes it the longest track the band has ever created.
As opposed to the rest of the album, this track is rather calm. Even though it is unclear why they decided to make this track, it was probably a sort of jamming session during which the members tried to improvise to create a different kind of song, proving their music wasnt just all about screaming and rapping, or heavy riffs.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I'm so frustrated
Some things are making me so sick inside
Aw, go with your heart, go with your heart
Yeah, right
Quit tugging me
Aw, I'm just not good enough for you
Let's change
Let's be something we're not
Let's be something everybody else is
Ah, so much built up inside
It's fucking ridiculous
I don't know if I should freak the fuck out on you
Or just sit back and laugh
You want more
You don't have anything
Me, me, I have everything
Yeah, I have everything
What more could I ask for?
Nothing at all

Release Date: July 1, 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-clunk-lyrics
Song Description: Clunk is the eighth song on Limp Bizkits debut studio album Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$.
The songs lyrics are about a pathetic alcoholic who roams the streets. Frontman Fred Durst describes his messed-up situation.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Clunk!
Clunk!
Clunk!
Clunk!
Clunk!
Clunk!
Clunk!

[Verse 1]
Hey mister, elevate that mind into a blister
You might need to rest up or pump that chest up
Because that mental is faded, ego you overplayed it
You buster, you just can't be trusted
The drama, your mama must've really been disgusted
But you got no clue always screaming everybody owes you
Well kid, I never did

[Chorus]
And never will, it's gone too far
It's gone too far and it's on!
I never did (Well, I never did kid!) it's gone too far

[Verse 2]
Drunken punk's been bringing all the funk in
Knowing you man, you're probably not thinking
Got you lip-syncing, lyric goes flying
Over that head, you'll be crying!
Lyin' in your deathbed, now you're just a reject
You point your finger at MC'y D just to gain a little respect
But you've got no clue, always screaming everybody owes you
Well, kid I never did

And never will, it's gone too far
Well it's gone way too far punk!
I never did, It's gone too far!

[Bridge]
You need to drop that freaking ego before you crash
Before the headlights are simply glaring in your eyes and you're going down
What's the matter with the life that you're leading?
When you're bleeding, everyone's thinking how much they hate you
It's not too late dude, just that time for you to zip up that grill
Take a deep breath and look around, there ain't nobody left you're just a target, bullseye
And still you walk around like a clown in a force field
See I'm not crazy, you're the one who's crazy
Institution bound to be the only way that we can even solve this
Had about as much as I can take so do yourself a favor
You've built that for so long
(Won't you just do yourself a favor?)
And I just wanna get it out
Clunk!

[Outro]
There's certainly some distortion in there. (What?)
Certainly some distortion in there
I can't hear you, I've got distortion in my ear
A thought just came to me while watching you and the guys play that
Um, the distortion feels the sound. It's like anguish or frustration
Like trying to thread, a needle with... with... thread
And you keep trying. (Can you thread a nee... a needle with a piece of rope?)
And I wonder, I wonder if that's what happened when the kids were getting the guitars
They were trying so hard, they wanted to play like their favorite singer
They just couldn't bring it off, so they turned it up louder just to...
Because even your face got red, and, and the expression on your face was that of, of sheer frustration, or anger, or just...
What do you feel when you play this distortion on there?
Um, what I feel when I play distortion like that is, I'm venting my... anger
Letting it all out, ya' know. There's no reservations or politeness
I'm no longer trying to please anyone, I'm trying to please me. Trying to get myself off
That's a form of honesty, isn't it?
I supposeEmbed

Uh, who could be the boss? Look up to the cross
Stranded in the land of the lost, standin' up I'm sideways
I'm blazin' up the path, runnin' on the highways of rap
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
Lava stamps then brands me like a bar code
I'm bashin' all the media strikes to keep the media dykes
As reinforcements for the fight
And that alone'll keep John Gotti on the phone
I'm tangled in the zone, I got the bees on the track
Where the fuck you at? (Tical!)
Let me hear you pigeons run ya mouth now (Shut the fuck up!)
I'm pluggin' in them social skills That keep my total bills

Playin' with mine's that get you state time
Locked behind 12 bars from a great mind
Killa bees in the club with his ladybug
Brought a sword on the dance floor to cut a rug
Love is love all day till they throw slugs
And take another life in cold blood
Can't feel me till it's your blood
Murder rates tremendous, crime is endless
Same shit different day, father forgive us
They know not what they do, all praise is due
I'm big like Easy and Big Bamboo

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Headstrong, dead calm, get it right on
Dead weight to dead wrong, let's get it on
Twelve rounds I throw down, who hold crown
Protect land with 4 pound, Limp Bizkit
Get around like merry-go, bust a scenario
Comin' through your stereo, why risk it
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
8 essential vitamins and minerals delicious
Word on the street is, they bit my thesis
Knocked out they front teefers, tryin' to taste mine
Actin like they heard it through the grapevine
Dope fiendin' for the bassline 2 for 5 rhyme
Pharmaceuticals, hard as nails to the cuticles
Where you find that monster she beautiful
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit roll on the set
Kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug and inject
[Verse 4: Fred Durst]
Mic check, so what's it all about? (Bout)
And where we gonna run? (Run), maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised for the blood of virgin eyes
We limpin' on the track with the Method
So get the sunblock (Sunblock), you gettin' one shot (Ha)
Until you dissolve, I revolve around everything you got
From outta nowhere, prepare, you be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare, now you're turned into stone
Without a microphone
But don't you forget you're in a zone (So shut the fuck up)
And take that shit back, cause all your shits wack
(Doo doo is doo doo) when it's weighed out like that
Burnin' up your brain like a piston
So all those that didn't listen
Now they even knew what they were missin'
And never even knew that the sky was fallin' down
Wu-Tang Clan for the crown

It was over your head, all day and everyday

And the Limp B-I-Z-K-I-T

It ain't easy bein' greasy
In a world full of cleanliness
And you know, all that other madness

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Oh no, guess who's back
Strapped with the flow like a Gatling blow
Walk with the limp it's the pirate pimp
On a nightmare track where the smackdown goes
Struck with the psycho, white bread, hybrid
Pennies get plucked from your eyelids, get that
Y'all better come quick, better come fast
I'm a drop a match in the gas, boom!
Every hit don't lie
Pitch you a fit when your shit don't fly
Eat you alive, got that punk
Spit this fire to the bizkit funk
Uno dos tres in your face
Catch me a case when you run from the ghost
With a cut in the clip one little slip
The alligator grip gonna turn you to toast

[Hook x2]
So WHY TRY, you're gonna die
You're going straight to the gate in the sky
With all the hate I relate to the cry
One more sucker mc gonna fry

[Verse 2]
Round two, stagger to your feet
Homies in your corner thought you'd done went to sleep
This one ought to do it, so step it on back
Or you'll be seeing stars when you're knocked out flat
I'm a tell you something you probably never knew
Tangle with the lion you're gonna end up in the zoo
Check out all your crew
Looking in my cage
It's feedin' time playa I'm a eat you like the plague
Times are gettin' tough
But I ain't had enough
This heavy metal beatin' on your brain is gonna crush
Oh what a rush
Like a million woman
Sour on the crush with all of you lemons

Having me some fun with you dumb little chicklets

Sometimes you gotta fight for your right when you're
Not sure you're in a fight for your life, right?
If you ain't packin' any tactics, you might get your ass kicked
Even if you are a little knucklehead
I'm kinda sick of being aggravated
I'm glad I'm hated, I guess I'm doin' somethin' right
That's what happened back in Columbine
You gotta know when to stop and don't go over the top
'Cause there's a chamber deep inside the brain
That's covered with chains, so don't be shakin' 'em loose
And if ya do, I'd be runnin' for the hills
'Cause I'm ready to rock and now I'm playin' for real

Or do ya draw the line just to give 'em a taste?

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Another one of those days
Feelin like a shovel with a lot of shit in the way
Gonna clear me a path
Right to the culprit, straight to your fucked up past
This ain't about rage It's about disrespect
You shoulda thought about that
Before your track went flat
Homie what the deal? Why you talkin' shit like that?
I've had enough drama
I don't need a chump talkin' that trash in pajamas
Heated up like a sauna
Time to pay the piper; I ain't givin' hope like Obama
I'm spittin out flames
Better hit the deck, I'ma mic check them games
You don't need a new coach:
You need a new neck once I connect with your throat!

[Hook]
Still shockin' like a heart attack
Cuz I'm a maniac (cuz I'm a maniac)
Still runnin' through the shark attack
Without a single scratch (without a single scratch)
Still limpin' where the dog is at
Up in my brainiac (up in my brainiac)
Still bitin' while your barkin' back
So you can shut your trap (shut it down)

Put another stain on your teeth

Homicide bad for your health (What?)
I'm goin' straight for the gut
Closin' them minds, sewin' them lips straight shut
Go ahead, put it on me, show me what you got
Why you get robbed like a zombie?
It's a one man army
Puff Puff give
Watch 'em get smoked like a cig
You heard of Freddy Kruger?
I'm kinda like that with a red cap and a Ruger
Still slingin' it to ya
Microphone hustla, bad motherfucker, screw ya

[Bridge]
Swimmin' with sharks ain't easy
They just want to kill and eat me
I ain't gonna let that happen
Watch me plan my shark attack, then
Make them wish they never knew me
Turn their great white ass to sushi
This is my old school technique
It's all I need to live in one piece, yeah!

Always finding places where I think nobody goes

Can't you just let me be, you leech?
(Oh, get it straight!)

And can't you take a hint? We thought you had a friend
It's such a shame that you're coming around again
Man, I'd really love to take you out like Chuck Norris
Instead I'd kick him with a vocal, slap him with a chorus
Man, I really shouldn't have to beg

Lyrics:

[Verse]
This pain in my stomach won't go away
I assume, this is punishment from all mistakes I've made
In a world where my actions speak louder than words
In a world where my actions speak louder than words

I know more people than ever before
One lesson I've learned from it all
Fortune and fame are disguised as your friend
'Cause I'm lonelier now than I've ever been

(I am my own worst enemy.)
(I am my own worst enemy.)
(This is one of those times. [?] those bad places that I go to.)
(I am my own worst enemy.)

([?], 'cause I don't really wanna do that.)
(I am my own worst enemy.)
(I am my own worst enemy.)
([?])
(I am my own worst enemy.)
(I am my own worst enemy.)
Go!

[Verse 1]
I stare into space and hope we're not alone
Am I searching for something that's better than home?
I've been working so hard
Stress is tremendous and pressure is endless
No one on this planet like me to be friends with

Loneliness can't be cured from no medicine
Look to the stars so they'll straighten my head again
I've been working so hard
I've been working so hard

I'm underneath the sun
I'm underneath the gun

I cloud all my thoughts, please go away
Oh, nevermind please, I'm checking out now
Won't ever come back, now that my life doesn't exist

Yeah, you're right
How does it feel to be right
Knowing that I was wrong?
Nothing is right when you're wrong
Yeah, you're right
How does it feel to be right
Knowing that I was wrong?
Nothing is right when you're wrong

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm underneath the sun
And I'm underneath the gun

Song Description: An interesting beginning to the EP, described by IGN as a skirling swirl of darkness.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Tell 'em how to sell it
It's propaganda

[Verse 1]
Don't tell me how to keep my composure
It ain't over till I get me some closure
Wanted dead or alive is my profile
Hostile is the frame for my state of grace
Severely a mental disorder
Where reality is highly distorted
Psychosis, weaken the mind
Incline to small doses as we approach this
Ever endless quest for a vengeance
While those who expose and pretend this
Life is just a big bowl of cherries
A bunch of fairies screaming to be scary

[Chorus]
It's propaganda
Sell it to the innocent
Oh yeah, they're buying it
Just tell them to rebel again

[Verse 2]
I'm a maniac, hard one to handle
You better come packing more than a scandal
Fucked over for the times I've been grateful
Fucked over led to times I've been hateful
Main attraction, fuck you in your pussy mouth
Cum again, friend, now we got some action
On and on is the name that they gave me
And your misery came here to save me

Title: Lightz (City of Angels)
Release Date: December 11, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-lightz-city-of-angels-lyrics
Song Description: Lightz is a song recorded by Limp Bizkit that leaked online in October 2012. The band responded with the following post:


LB fans and family  we appreciate your support and kind words in regards to the LIGHTZ video leak yesterday. It is an emotional song and closely attached to our internal demons, but it is not our single and wasnt meant to be seen or heard for along time. We are building a collection of work for 2013 that ranges everywhere from raw nu metal to extreme experimental. We are having a lot of fun just doing whatever we want, whenever we want. Some of the very few negative comments out there are indicators that the Internet is a dwelling place for keyboard king kongs who are so miserable in their own lives that they cannot control the urge to make other people feel their misery. That shit doesnt work on me anymore and for the most part, most of you. The funniest piece of this puzzle is when someone is so unaware (not self aware) that the actual fact of spreading negativity even when your doing it to say something positive is still, in fact, spreading negativity. Let me give you an example  ding dong writes Who cares if my hypster friends think y'all suck. I still like y'all thanks, but no thanks.  King Kong writes fuck you. Youre not allowed to do anything at all besides things that make me and my ape friends stoked. That pussy thing is for faggots. Moron. I hope youre around no other human beings until youre capable of being respectful. There are bullies everywhere. Its hard to completely remove them from your life sometimes and thats unfortunate, but until then just do your best to realize they are simply idiots who arent self aware enough to evolve past their own problems and misery. That being said, keep on doing you and we will keep on limpin with the BIZKIT.

New music pilin up. Lots of it. So many sick riffs and grooves that my head is spinning. Preproduction is finished for SOTDE. We start final recordings in November for the first album.

Wed like to hire real LB fans for our website admin as well as help documenting our journey from this point on. Think about it for a minute and decide if you are truly ready for life on the road with a nu metal band. I will start that process very soon.

We love you and always will. Without you it wouldnt be worth it.

Freddy D


Lightz was uploaded to the bands YouTube channel in December 2013, and the track was ultimately never officially released as a single.

The pain is so beautiful

In a room full of darkness

[Verse 1]
What the fuck did days become, what a phase to run
We don't judge no priest, we don't reach – we come
There's smoke all in my lungs, just fuck you, I'm havin' fun
We ain't blind, we see – we don't beat, we drum
Organize the ways, damn, this life is a stage
Grab the moment and own it, I'm lookin' forward today
Before I hop on this plane, it's important to say
Goodbye to my kids, you know, you better behave
I'm livin' outta my soul, fuck it, there's no regrets
I'm hittin' Texas, we're [?] at this cash money, no bet
I've seen this ship before and I ain't have no fear
I'm near, I'm near, I'm near, bitch, I'm right here
Fuck it, I'ma drink, if I don't get a DUI

I had been through this storm, been through the rain
People tellin' me lies, nobody takin' the blame
Jumpin' through all my thoughts, like it's a picket fence
All the shit that I've done doesn't really make sense
Show 'em how to behave, show 'em how to go far
Show 'em how you believe, show 'em just who you are
Fell in love with a stripper, she happy outta my head
Every fucked up lady, you can say what she said
With every single right I'm always born white
I'm punchin' these walls and it ain't no right
No, I'm chief, no bite – come and live in the night
And I sleep in the day, that's some vampire life
Cash money, metal – I should get a medal
Goin' for the gold, life don't settle
It's a race to the pain, beauty is the name
Tag it on my arm 'cause my life won't change

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Hold up, let me see your bottles up
We the band with the brand and we blowin' up
This goin' out to the people who don't give a fuck
Time to throw a little party, who's showin up?
Draggin' swifties from the house to the front lawn
Start it up at dusk, wrap it up about dawn
All you ladies feelin' crazy, time to get it on
Ain't invitin' any fellas, they can stay at home
Lethal rockin' on the tables, droppin' all the funk
Sammy got the quarter, pourin' drinks from his trunk
Otto got the fire goin' warmin' up the buns
Wes is dressed up like an alien, we havin' fun

[Chorus]
Looks like the ratio is 90.2.10
90 percent filled up with women again
The block is full so let the party get hot
It's how we do it, if you like it or not
Looks like the ratio is 90.2.10
90 percent filled up with women again
The block is full so let the party get hot
It's how we do it, if you like it or not

[Verse 2]
We got this party goin' harder than a motherfucker
All these naked ladies makin' out with one another
Playboy Bunnies on the roof in the mini-skirts
I'm lookin' up and what I'm seein' then, it really hurts
My brother Corey D. is paintin' up a couple bodies
You ain't never seen a party with this many hotties
I just heard that Paul Wall is comin' now
Raekwon is on the mic and he's buggin' out
Corey Taylor got a harem chasin' him around
We ain't slippin' with his knot, then we goin' down
But it doesn't got this lovin' comin 'at me
Ain't nothin' new cause I'm rollin' with the LB

Lyrics:

[Hook]
I'm a loser yes it's true
Feels like I'm losing since I met you
Through the good times and the bad
Feels like I'm losing all I've ever had

Check it out

Back in the days there was ways
I was movin' on guns all ablaze
Dwellin' on the past like I do
Still can't forgive all the abuse
That ain't no way to rise from the crib
Still runnin' hard from the shit
Why you wanna push my buttons?
Makin' sure that I feel nothin?
Do you really think you need to remind me
Everytime every single second that I'm alive
Just to make yourself feel better? I don't think so
I just wanna do it all right
Find me better place in this life
We bring out the worst in each other
That ain't no way to love one another

I just wanna be okay
There ain't nothin' wrong with that
I'm losin' my life away
Losin' myself and I want it back

Do you remember when we both used to be so in love for eternity?
All the promises that we made
All our friends said we had it made
Yeah, there were times we were rough
Times we were down, world spinnin' round
Everybody goes through a brawl
But me and you could crash through it all
We were both lions in a cage
We were both livin' through the rage
We were still afraid and we both had everything but didn't have it made
I'm really feelin' bad that we both gonna have to say goodbye now (Goodbye)
But it is what it is baby I'm gonna have to take a time out
(Goodbye)

I just wanna be okay
There ain't nothin' wrong with that (Goodbye)
I'm losin' my life away
Losin' myself and I want it back

What can I do?
I've got an idea, I think I'll just become a priest
Deceiving them with my belief
I'll preach about what life is worth
And cover my sins with the church
My demons can run around free
No one will suspect a thing
I'll show them it's okay to lust

Lyrics:

One for the trouble

Hooded black
Dropping vengeance upon your back
Cause you ain't jack
Talking smack
Consequences the game reacts
With a pain attack
Trim the fat
Go the distance the Bizkit back
You get no slack
Spray the gat
Pack the clip with the riff attack
Fade the black

You're feeling like you're really that invincible
Reality will leave you feeling terrible
This moment is past the point of critical
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

Lyrics:

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
The dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see that's why my brain says "rage"?
Rage, rage, rage, rage

Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
Violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny's in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill is such a friendly word
Seems the only way
'To' reaching out again
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny's in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill is such a friendly word
Seems the only way
To bring it back again
Mirror stares back hard
Kill is such a friendly word
Seems the only way
To bring it back again!

Title: The Story
Release Date: May 2, 2005, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-the-story-lyrics
Song Description: The Story is a song by nu-metal band Limp Bizkit from their EP The Unquestionable Truth, Part 1 that talks about the life of living in Hollywood as a celebrity and how it can be twisted sometimes.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Just live and let die
Check, check, check, come on

[Verse 1]
If you could take a minute of your life
That certain minute when you feel the lightning strike
To each his own on the level of that moment
But it's your moment, and you know you'll fucking own it
Glorified and embraced by your victory
When you're done, you escape with that memory
Blindfolded through this life as we learn
And consequences when the wrong page is turned

[Chorus]
It's an E! True Hollywood Story
Take a man down with his own glory? Now guess who's next

[Verse 2]
At some point, we come down from the highs
And so be it, we move on with our lives
Some of us let the laughs cover cries
Do the math, you can laugh when I die
If life is just a fantasy, then could you
Live this fantasy life? If so, then would you?
Just remember that the doors are not closeable
And your motherfucking heroes are disposable

Title: Drown
Release Date: September 23, 2003, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-drown-lyrics
Song Description: Its like a song where your most traumatic memories manifest to overflow you, to drown you and then you just get saved from everything around you, you dont see the way you used to see life anymore
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It's getting closer to the end, every part of me
Then disaster takes its toll and now I'm left with only me
Maybe sorrow plays a role when you feel unkind
Your abuses matter, standing up forever lost in time

[Chorus]
Save me, save me before I drown
Save me, save me before I drown

[Verse 2]
It's getting closer to the end, I look back and smile
We conquered every single bump in my road, made it all worthwhile
Just remember how I cared when it came crashing down
I'd like to toast to all those angels that were always hanging 'round

[Chorus]
Save me, save me before I drown
Save me, save me before I drown, drown
Oh, woah

[Outro]
Maybe life ain't what it seems, 'cause it's all a dream
Forgive me

Song Description: This is a hidden track on the album Significant Other. You have to let the rant at the end play out and this comes on.
Lyrics:

[Verse: Les Claypool]
Hit me, Fire cracker
So there you go
Fifteen of your hard earned dollars
Right out the window
Most expensive piece of plastic
I've ever come across
Fifteen dollars, fifteen dollars
On a shoddy piece of plastic
There is it Limp Bizkit in all it's glory
Fred Durst, the man, the myth
The compulsive masturbator
You love him, you hate him
You love to hate him, Hello
Once when I was afraid to speak
When I was just a lad
My poppy gave my nose a tweak
And told me I was bad
Then I learned a brilliant word
Saved my aching nose
The biggest word you've ever heard
And this is how it goes
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though he sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Ah, those were the days
I don't know, you got any more of that
So what did you think
You were getting a Celine Dion record
No, no, no young bucky
You laughed, you cried
You just kissed your
Fifteen bucks goodbye
Limp Bizkit, I don't think so
Fred Durst, I don't know
But what the hell, I got paid

Title: It’s Like That Y’all
Release Date: October 10, 2000, URL: https://genius.com/Limp-bizkit-its-like-that-yall-lyrics
Song Description: Its Like That Y'all is a collaboration song between Limp Bizkit and the legendary hip-hop pioneers Run-DMC. Although it was not included on the standard edition of Limp Bizkits third studio album, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, this track became a standout bonus addition on expanded versions of the album.

Interestingly, Its Like That Y'all has a unique distinction when it comes to its availability and censorship. On all CD versions of Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, the song is censored. However, on the LP (vinyl record), the track is uncensored.

[Verse 1: Fred Durst]
L-I-M-P in the place to be
Never went to college or had an ID
Now all the critics wanna know about me
But if you read about me, you don't know about me
And new reporters wanna dog me
And stick their noses up my fuckin' ass before they rob me
In every lobby, you'll see my face on a Spin inside
Criticizin' my hobby again
These motherfuckers don't know (They don't know)
I open magazines, checkin' out my life like a fuckin' show
And now I'm gettin' mad at where the good was
You always put the bad at, I can't have that
See I'm the one who gets laughed at
But that shit'll pass, 'cause I always get the last laugh
And I'll keep comin' with my revenge
And leave you loose at the ends like a heroin syringe (D'oh)
And keep rollin' in this new Benz
With all my fake friends that break when the tape ends
I'm stayin' platinum on this Rolex (Platinum)
No need to go high-tech with all these seven-figure checks
'Cause I just won the lotto (Lotto)
My beats from DJ Lethal
My man John Otto, the Desperados
I found life gets so funny
With a single on the Billboard and a little bit of money

Yo, it's like a tick-a-tock, tee and a tick-a-tock too
A full-fledged member of the [?] crew

The kings from Queens, from Queens come kings
Raisin' Hell like a class when the lunch bell rings

[Verse 3: John Otto]
For every average ear, beware of this content
Construct the scene, prolific
The beat sophisticate
To leave you less eminent, stuck
With the complex in this context
To bring divinity to all emcees, [?]
This philosophy extends from the bass drum
Slay some, I lay some to rest
To screw legislation, put you on the quest for imitation
But now the sign reads "Foes" in my window pane
The high elevates and simulate your fate
Premature tape, ejaculate
Feel the thump just out the high eight
Phone rings heavy in your dome (Yeah)
I wonder what's it like to be a clone with that smiley goat
You so-called throat these notes
Deep throat through pass and paragraphs
Tracks, I know you can't understand
This abstract's enormous, my sound is enormous

Lyrics:

It might take too long to turn the lights back on
I guess I lay awake, I guess I'll lay here and pray
Could you pour me one more drink? A glass of gasoline
Help me burn my pain, light me up in the rain

My so-called life is so good

[Chorus]
Why do we die?
Why do we die?
Slow down

You wonder how I've been, you ain't been checkin' in
Just hope my vital signs would send me home again
My baby's in the grass, Jesus on the dash
I drive myself insane just hopin' I could stay

Song Description: Third exclusive track on Greatest Hitz. It is a cover/medley of Home Sweet Home by Mtley Cre and Bitter Sweet Symphony by The Verve.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I guess I'm a dreamer, but my heart is gold
I had to run away high so I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right, didn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song and you'll never feel left all alone
Take me to your heart, feel me in your bones
Just one more night and I'm coming off this long and winding road

[Chorus]
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
Home sweet home

[Verse 2]
I guess that I seem to make romantic dreams
Up in lights, fallin' off the silver screen
My heart's like an open book for the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing keeps me together at the seams

[Chorus]
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
Home sweet home
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
Home

[Bridge]
It's a bittersweet symphony, this life
Just tryin' to make ends meet, you're a slave to the money then you die
There's no change, I can't change, I can't change, I can't change
But I'm here in my mind, I'm here in my mind
I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mind, no, no, no
