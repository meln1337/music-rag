Artist: Playboi Carti, Alternate Names: King Vamp, Jordan Carter, Sir Cartier, Carti, Jordan Terrell Carter, Cash Carti
Artist Description: Jordan Terrell Carter (born September 13, 1995), professionally known as Playboi Carti, is an American recording artist from Atlanta, Georgia.

Carti began his musical journey in 2010 as Sir Cartier—a twist on his last name that was also indicative of a growing interest in fashion and luxury brands. In May 2013, he changed his artist name to Playboi Carti and joined Awful Records. The production behind most of Carti’s earliest works was handled by Awful Records' in-house producer Ethereal, who helped him garner a local following. Carti frequently collaborated with family friend and fellow Zone 3 rapper UnoTheActivist on songs such as “Whole Thang” and “Every Since.”

After graduating from North Springs High School in 2014, Carti moved to New York. There, he became acquainted with fashion tastemakers Ian Connor and A$AP Bari, who introduced him to A$AP Rocky at SXSW in March 2015. Carti later became affiliated with Rocky’s creative agency, AWGE. A month later, in April 2015, Carti released singles “Broke Boi” and “Fetti,” respectively, which proved to be viral hits in the underground rap scene. On September 10, 2016, Rocky announced at a show that Carti had signed to Interscope Records.

Under Interscope and AWGE, Carti released his long-awaited debut commercial mixtape, Playboi Carti on April 14, 2017. The record featured two of Carti’s biggest singles, “Magnolia” and “wokeuplikethis*,” which propelled him into the mainstream.

After months of gaining buzz and momentum from his successful debut mixtape, Carti released his debut studio album, Die Lit, on May 11, 2018. The album included popular tracks “Love Hurts,” “Shoota,” and “Poke It Out.” Die Lit exemplifies the power of simplicity, featuring effortless vibes and hypnotic flows that result in catchy, uncomplicated tracks. On certain songs, notably “FlatBed Freestyle,” Carti explores different vocal inflections and emphasizes his Atlanta accent in his delivery.

In 2019, Carti co-founded and curated Opium, his record label and creative agency based in Atlanta, Georgia.

On December 25, 2020, Carti released his widely acclaimed sophomore studio album, Whole Lotta Red. Initially, the album received mixed reviews, with many fans feeling it did not meet their expectations. However, as time passed and Carti continued performing songs from the album, the general consensus shifted dramatically. It is now regarded as one of the best modern rap albums of all time.

Carti is currently in the process of releasing his forthcoming third studio album, I AM MUSIC.

Title: wokeuplikethis*
Release Date: March 10, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-wokeuplikethis-lyrics
Song Description: wokeuplikethis* is a direct confrontation to imitators of Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Verts distinct and unique style. The track features the classic hip-hop tropes of money, drugs and women. However, Carti expresses his frustration with the copycat genre throughout the chorus. One such imitator may be Smokepurpp, who copied the vocals and production of Cartis 2014 single Smash in 2016. This song makes it clear that Carti and Uzi consider one and other as pioneers of the late 2010s generation of trap music.

This track marks the fourth released collaboration between Playboi Carti and Philadephia-born rapper Lil Uzi Vert. The song was released as a single along with Lookin (which featured Lil Uzi as well) prior to the release of Cartis debut mixtape Playboi Carti.

Title: Long Time (Intro)
Release Date: May 11, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-long-time-intro-lyrics
Song Description: Long Time begins Playboi Cartis debut album with an ode to the determination that allowed him to become successful as a recording artist and the luxuries he can enjoy since releasing his acclaimed 2017 eponymous mixtape.

Through its introspective lyrics, the song reflects on the challenges faced in Cartis pursuit of wealth under the music industry as opposed to a traditional career.

The track was rumored to originally be the outro of Die Lit with Check Please as the intro; Check Please was leaked on May 2, 2018, so it was not released.

The chorus suggests Carti indulges in various substances to reach a state of numbness. He also addresses his feelings towards his girl, and how he has fallen out of love for her over time.

The instrumental features video game-esque synths, booming 808s, and is done by Art Dealer who he previously collaborated with on Long Time (Intro) on Die Lit.

Title: 2024
Release Date: December 14, 2023, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-2024-lyrics
Song Description: 2024 was recorded on December 10, 2023, releasing to YouTube with an accompanying music video four days later. It marks the second promotional single of Playboi Cartis third studio album, Music, preceded by Different Day.

Carti begins this track similar to its predecessor, with his signature high-pitched vocal tone. As the track progresses, however, he eventually adopts a grimier, deeper tone, which he officially unveiled with his guest appearance on Travis Scotts FE!N.

Shortly before this songs release, Carti took to Instagram to post a story featuring Opium affiliate Blackhaine, revealing the 9:30 PM Eastern Standard Time release.

Eight months later, the song was removed from YouTube due to a copyright claim by the music company Believe, which distributed Jacobs Ladder by Yeo, a song sampled in 2024. A couple of days later, the video was returned.

Title: Stop Breathing
Release Date: December 25, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-stop-breathing-lyrics
Song Description: Stop Breathing is a high-energy punk-rap homage to Gucci Manes Shirt Off, an ode to Cartis gang members, as well as a brutal diss track aimed at incarcerated ATL rapper Ola Runt and his Henchmen gang. The Henchmen killed a close friend of Cartis named Bigg Sosa, which is what prompted Carti to channel his anger into this diss.

On this track, Carti alleges that he had his gang shank Ola Runt in prison, and also claims the Henchmens hang-out spot, Front Street in Atlanta.

Ola has since responded on Instagram, saying Diss songs dont bring back dead niggas. Henchmen member Woo da Savage also responded, claiming that Carti had never even been to Front Street.

Title: Cancún
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-cancun-lyrics
Song Description: Cancn is an unreleased track. Although the video was a collaboration between AWGE affiliates Chris Skylark and Kelvin Krash, Cancn was first previewed on July 2, 2018 in an Instagram post made by Hidji. In the clip, Carti is seen walking around a parking garage in London dancing to the song.  The snippet garnered over hundreds of thousands of plays across the Internet. It spawned a very popular meme based around the end of the video, where Carti rubs his stomach with British pounds and repeatedly says My stummy hurt.

The second verse of Cancn was recorded on September 2, 2018. The song was leaked on September 3, 2019.

Title: @ MEH (AT MEH)
Release Date: April 16, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-meh-at-meh-lyrics
Song Description: @ MEH finds Carti disregarding his opposers and any hate surrounding him. The track marks Cartis first solo release since his debut album Die Lit in May 2018.

The phrase at (@) me is typically used on social media sites such as Twitter as a form of mockery after a subtweet.  Its worth noting that Carti had the phrase @@@ me in his Instagram bio from the start of 2019 until this single was released. In a June 2019 interview with The FADER, Carti explained that he stays away from the negativity of social media:

I just look, then I get off, cause I get upset.

Carti first teased a new release on April 14, 2020, when he shared the singles artwork on social media. Information about the track surfaced on a music blog the next day before a snippet was leaked.

The song features production from Deskhop, Neeko Baby, and jetsonmade, who have not worked with Carti before. It was accompanied by a music video directed by Carti and Nick Walker.

Title: ILoveUIHateU
Release Date: December 25, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-iloveuihateu-lyrics
Song Description: On ILoveUIHateU, Carti opens up about how his relationship with drugs is affecting his life. The track sounds like a classic Carti song we know; it has a spacey beat, bars talking about drugs like codeine and MDMA, and a bit of mumbling. The title refers to his love-hate relationship with the mentioned drugs: he knows its been destroying him, but he still just cant get enough of it.

This track is produced by the Atlanta rappers close friend and frequent producer partner, Pi'erre Bourne. Surprisingly enough, this is only one of only two songs on Whole Lotta Red that Pi'erre produced, with the other being the 18th track, Place.
Lyrics:

Title: New Choppa
Release Date: April 14, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-new-choppa-lyrics
Song Description: New Choppa features production that furthers itself away from the usual upbeat and bubbly style Carti is known to use and is more influenced by Rockys darker trap style, yet still flooded with the recognisable sound of a money counter. Both Carti and Rocky are included in the production credits, along with Ricci Riera, a member of the production team T.H.C.

This is not the first time Rocky and Carti have collaborated, being heard on London Town and Telephone Calls from the 2016 collaborative mixtape by the A$AP Mob, Cozy Tapes Vol. 1: Friends. However, this is the first time weve seen such an intimate collaboration between the two, highlighting their chemistry and abilities.

Accused of being bougie by a snobby bitch
Cops want to ID us

Title: Go2DaMoon
Release Date: December 25, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-go2damoon-lyrics
Song Description: Go2DaMoon is an aggressive track from Carti and Ye, with both artists flaunting common themes from their careers. Kanye speaks on his rebound faith and business successes, while Carti violently raps about his enemies and drug use.

Carti teased this track on November 24, 2020, just shortly after he announced Whole Lotta Red had been turned in to Interscope Records for release. Carti also thanked A$AP Bari, AKA Young Lord, in the posts caption for the song, as Bari and Kanye have connections from both the music and fashion industries.

However, the final version of the song ended up being different than the rendition Carti previewed. In the original snippet, Kanye rapped:

Talked my wife into a three-way, ayy

The line does not appear on the final song.
Lyrics:

She ugly hot, like a chick that call you to borrow
Five hunnid, then promise she gon' pay you back tomorrow
Then left with a scammer with a Gucci hat from Marshalls
Slept with him, then woke up, saw his watch was a Fossil
Everybody wear a costume, spray a little extra perfume
YEEZYs in the stock room, that's the name, make the stock boom
Hit the club with at least ten, you in a 500, that's a cheap Benz
I promised Playboi we'd get the tape out 'fore the weekend is over
Too famous to sneak in
Wolverine in a sheepskin, I be goin' off the deep end
We here for a reason, boy, we got more to do
You texted like, "Yo," I'm like, "Yo, I been avoidin' you"
Ye Jesus gang, you correct
You always askin' for Buddha, you a Budapest (Ayy)
If they don't play this, call the DJ

Release Date: January 15, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-evilj0rdan-lyrics
Song Description: EVILJ0RDAN embraces the deep-voiced theme of Music, as Playboi Carti paints a picture of his mysterious lifestyle.

The title references Cartis birth name, Jordan. However, like many of Musics promotional singles, the instance of the letter O is replaced with a zero in homage the Opium label. While EVIL describes Cartis portrayed persona, it may also be a nod to the newly-coined YVL movement.

On December 8, 2023, Carti took to Instagram to share two snippets of EVILJ0RDAN on his story. The first snippet teased the songs instrumental with an image designed by SEX IS DEATH that read:

IM NOT PLAYING

This was followed by another snippet posted two hours later featuring vocals from Carti as well as narration by South Carolina disk jockey, DJ Swamp Izzo. It was teased with the text 2024, confirming Musics release year.

Cartis cousin Kee revealed in a post made to X that the song had been recorded the night previous:

he just made this last night btw

Weeks later, on January 15, 2024, Blackhaine announced the 9:30 PM Eastern Standard Time release for that daysimilar to most of Musics singles. The track soon released to Playboi Cartis alternative Instagram through a music video.
Lyrics:

[Verse: Playboi Carti & DJ Swamp Izzo]
First I go whip out the boat
No, I can't hit on no brakes
My life is out of control
I'm tellin' you, nobody safe
I've been livin' my life limbo
My ice, it came with a tray
I'm so high, I gotta hide my face
This not a rockstar phase
I'm a emo thug in my phase
Syrup, syrup, syrup, syrup, tell her two gold chains
Monkey nuts, hold me, baby, I got on two chains
Roll another blunt and I might motherfuckin' faint
Spin on the block, have a pussy nigga stained
I just put on my boots, ain't worried 'bout no rain
Put a nigga down, Channel 2 front page
You was just askin' for some change, now you changed
Yeah, I told you, yeah, about that money, shit get strange
Fully loaded Jag, hold up, baby, Jordan paid
I put duct tape on my switch, perfect aim
They can't put me in no genre, baby, 'cause I changed the game
We fuckin' on the same ho, but we not the same
Disrespect the 5, I put your ass in the food chain (Swamp Izzo)
Bitch keep callin' my phone, she sayin' Ms. Jackson goin' through her brain (Carti)
We was just outside dancin', movin' on molly, feelin' insane (He's comin')
I fucked the bitch so nasty, we go Sephora, yeah, then we go Pink
She not so fuckin' toxic, and she care about what I think
She's nothin' like no other bitches, she care about what I drink
I think she's a fling
I think she's a playmaker
She should be on my team
She should get her a ring
Shit, it can't be me
But she can be on the team
Diamonds, they come out the water
My sock, it come with a ring
The Wraith came with the chauffeur
The chauffeur ready to take me

Song Description: Filled up with references to Cartis gang affiliation and reckless lifestyle, Vamp Anthem is a two-minute-long energetic ode to the vampiric aesthetic displayed throughout Whole Lotta RedPlayboi Carti notably refers to himself as King Vamp on the albums 17th track.

Title: Love Hurts
Release Date: May 2, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-love-hurts-lyrics
Song Description: Love Hurts (originally stylised as ++* love hurts ** on SoundCloud) is the second collaboration between Playboi Carti and Travis Scott, following Travis' Green & Purple. It is also Cartis first single of 2018 following his 2017 debut self-titled mixtape.

Throughout the song, the two flex their lavish lifestyles as rockstars, a topic thats most recently played a huge role in hip-hop  notably through Post Malones hit song, rockstar.

The song was first teased in August 2017 when Travis posted a video of himself singing part of his verse. Part of the song was later teased by Carti in early 2018, and more of Travis' verse later surfaced by someone who had the song.

A rough demo of the song leaked on May 1, 2018, prompting Carti to officially release it the following day with an updated mix. According to the filename of the leak, the song was originally titled Rockstar.

Lyrics:

[Verse]
You niggas don't love me, your bitch wanna fuck me
My t-shirt on, so I won't get ugly
She fuckin' with a dime, I'm fuckin' with a bomb
They think I'm Osama, woah, she think I'm off somethin'
I'm fuckin' with a bad lil' vibe, Molly all over her tongue
I'm 'bout to spot me a opp, I'm 'bout to spin their truck, woah
I said, "Momma, I got me a switch, we don't give a fuck 'bout luck"
Ah, hah
Ice on my body, I'm the coolest
Trampoline jump for a cougar
Jump out the jungle, go hectic
I'm leavin' that boy on his dulla
She wanna fuck for the moolah
Pussy-ass niggas get lit up
That Pelle Pelle hold the Ruger
I was just layin' with your girl, huh
She like bein' 'round my niggas
She T'd up, she not switchin'
G6 got me in here glitchin'
Hood-rich as fuck, just livin'
This bitch ain't got no vision
I'ma go ahead and give it to her
I just been feeling myself
I found Jesus, Christian Dior
Got a bitch wanna fuck on the gang
Shit, put a stain right on the floor
Got me feelin' like Jason Chase
I'm switchin' lanes on these whores
Stop all that talkin', let's do it
You on the internet, boy, stop, boy
I'm in the field with cleats, Sig in my jeans, I kill boys
Me and my niggas, we Gs, step on bitches, we kick doors
I stay runnin' up checks and holdin' the knife, it's a sport
Sittin' with my blick, I got me a gang, I can't go to court, uh

Song Description: On Lean 4 Real, Carti recruits Londons one and only king of grime Skepta for an ode to his favorite drink, none other than Dirty Sprite.

Lean is not just a favorite of Cartis, but also has been a hip-hop staple since the late 1990s. The drink mixes soda (typically Sprite or Fanta), prescription-strength cough medicine containing codeine and promethazine, and hard candy (usually Jolly Ranchers) for flavor.

Title: M3tamorphosis
Release Date: December 25, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-m3tamorphosis-lyrics
Song Description: On M3tamorphosis, Carti and Kid Cudi team up to discuss the evolution of their stylefrom rappers to rockstars. They rhyme over a beat with gritty synths and hard-hitting bass, led by Cudis signature hums. The songs title is fitting as both Carti and Cudi have switched up their respective styles musically and aesthetically between projects.

M3tamorphosis debuted with an official music video upon its release, directed by Nico Ballesteros and featuring the two artists performing while being surrounded by the dark of the night and ominous red lights. As Whole Lotta Red got mixed public reception (at least in the first months since its release), this clip has infamously become Cartis most disliked video, reaching over 32,000 thumbs-downs on YouTube.

Title: Let It Go
Release Date: April 14, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-let-it-go-lyrics
Song Description: On Let It Go, Playboi Carti talks about dealing drugs.

Pi'erre Bourne originally used the tracks instrumental on an unreleased song but later gave it to Carti, as was previewed by him in an Instagram live video in 2018. Pi'erres track featured a different instrumental from what was finally used on Let It Go; its lead synth melody only appeared on the chorus and it had more kicks. The original instrumental was also given to Carti but was later changed. This was seen during Carti and Pierres first studio session together, livestreamed on February 20, 2017. Cartis original version of Let It Go, which features different lyrics and the aforementioned instrumental, was livestreamed by MexikoDro on the same day. On March 21, 2017, Carti previewed it in full quality on Twitter:

https://twitter.com/playboicarti/status/841107158414557184

On February 20, 2017, Dro, who provides the background vocals on this track, tweeted that he does not want to work with Carti again. When Carti previewed the song the next month, Dro tweeted at Carti to remove Dros vocals. This was because Carti allegedly did not pay him for his work.

Title: New N3on
Release Date: December 25, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-new-n3on-lyrics
Song Description: New N3on (originally dubbed Neon) is the 13th track on Playboi Cartis sophomore studio album, Whole Lotta Red.

The song is the fourth officially released collaboration between Carti and Philadelphia-based producer Maaly Raw, following Left Right with Lil Uzi Vert, Of Course We Ghetto Flowers with Lil Uzi Vert and Offset, and Shoota, in order of recording.

Maaly Raw created and previewed the instrumental for this song in an Instagram live video in late 2018.

Carti first previewed and performed the song in Seattle on the first stop of his 2018 North American tour, the Neon Tour. Additionally, Carti took to Instagram to tease the song on his story.

An early version of Neon leaked online on May 29, 2019. Following this, Carti recorded new bars for the song, and an open verse was added.

On September 29, 2019, at Rolling Loud Bay Area, Carti announced that Neon was being considered to be placed on Whole Lotta Red.

The second version of Neon, featuring a few different lines, different mixing, and an open verse, leaked on November 2, 2019. However, the second version was abandoned and the first version was released on Whole Lotta Red with an updated mix.

In 2022, an alternate version of the song surfaced, featuring an unreleased verse by Lil Uzi Vert.
Lyrics:

You know I treat you good, I don't wanna meet your hoes
I took you out the hood, I took you to my shows
We took a lot of pics and now we look like goals
We tried some new things, we fucked a couple hoes
You changin' mood swings, you got me, I don't know
We gettin' back in, walked through the back door
You had some surgeries, but it's still fat, though
You like the cash, girl, you helped the cash grow
You drive a Lambo' with some leg room

Title: F33l Lik3 Dyin
Release Date: December 25, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-f33l-lik3-dyin-lyrics
Song Description: On the closing track of Whole Lotta Red, Carti updates his audience on the current status of his mental health and aspirations.

The songs soulful instrumental, which samples Bon Ivers 2019 track iMi, juxtaposes Cartis melancholy and somewhat near-nihilistic lyrics.

Throughout the song, Carti explains that, although he comes across as flamboyant and loud, deep down, he yearns for love like every human. This despair may stem from his break-up with Iggy Azalea, the mother of his child.

The track fits outside of the vamp inspired tracklist, presenting itself as its own entity, aimed to wrap up the album on a higher note whilst providing the listeners with an update on Cartis mental state.

Further, the songs title, pitched-up vocal sample, and melancholy lyrics may be an homage to Lil Waynes 2007 song I Feel Like Dying.

On one track, an 8-bit beat where he says RIP Yams in the refrain, Carti sings a wordless melody in a falsetto behind his verses.

Title: Goku
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-goku-lyrics
Song Description: Goku, also known as Asthma, is an unreleased, unfinished song by Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti, which, judging from the OG filename  Goku 8.9.18, was recorded on August 9, 2018, at the same session as Slick featuring RX PESO, Skeleton, and Butterfly Doors. It was first previewed on August 8, 2018 by Carti in a video posted to his Instagram story, an hour before he came out to perform at his show at Stage AE in Pittsburgh, PA. Eventually, the song leaked online on September 2, 2019, with an open verse.

The caption of the snippet was in reference to Carti revealing that he regularly suffers from bad cases of asthma, which led fans to dub the song Asthma before the official title was revealed when it leaked. This snippet was one of the most anticipated songs teased after the release of Die Lit for the upcoming LP Whole Lotta Red, which was an EP at the time.

Title: POP OUT*
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-pop-out-lyrics
Song Description: Pop Out is a currently unreleased Playboi Carti song which was debuted during Cartis Wireless Festival 2023 set on July 7, 2023. The aggressive song highlights Cartis signature rage aesthetic over upbeat production from Slowburnz and F1LTHY, who have previously worked with either Carti or his Opium label. Carti notably adopts a deeper tone of voice, which has been heard in many of his unreleased songs recorded from 2021 onwards, and most notably on Travis Scotts FE!N, released in July 2023, making it the first released song featuring his deeper tone.

Pop Out was seemingly recorded in 2023 and is expected to appear on Cartis long-awaited third studio album, MUSIC. It was performed for the second time at Rolling Loud Miami on July 21, 2023 and for the third time at Blockfest in Finland on August 18, 2023.

Title: Pump Fake! (Freestyle)
Release Date: July 21, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-pump-fake-freestyle-lyrics
Song Description: Pump Fake is a freestyle by Atlanta trap artist Playboi Carti, with production by Ethereal.

A pump fake is a move in basketball where the ball handler restrains a jump shot before leaving the ground, causing the defender to jump or be off-balance, possibly referencing Cartis ability to cause his haters to make fools of themselves before inevitably scoring on them.
Lyrics:

Title: Shoota (Demo)
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-shoota-demo-lyrics
Song Description: One week prior to the release of Die Lit, a rough demo of Shoota was leaked. In this version, there is more Auto-Tune vocal pitch correction and Lil Uzi Vert has a second verse. In the released version it is replaced with a Carti verse.

Despite a common misconception, the song was never named Rocket. That name was given by fans before the song released because they misheard this line by Uzi in the songs snippet:

Stackin', rackin', all hundreds Im packin'
Lyrics:

[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert]

Title: One Day
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-one-day-lyrics
Song Description: One Day is historically notable as one of the first songs created by Playboi Carti and producer Pi'erre Bourne. It was originally previewed by Pi'erre in early 2017 before the release of Cartis debut self-titled album, around the time the two first met. At this point, Pi'erre was virtually unheard of in the rap scene.

Hope for the songs release was revitalized in early Summer 2019 when it was played by Cartis former manager, Ian Connor, on Instagram. The song later leaked on September 2, 2019.

Two years later, on September 2, 2021, Carnage previewed a remix of the song featuring a Drake verse at a performance in Germany. Two days later, on September 4, 2021, Drake played this version of the song in full on episode 46 of Night Owl Sounds The Fry Yiy Show, for the release of his sixth studio album, Certified Lover Boy.

Title: Cartier
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-cartier-lyrics
Song Description: Cartier sees Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Vert rap about the French luxury designer brand on the aptly named track. Fans believe they recorded the track at the same time as SRT, in April 2020, when both Carti and Uzi were in Philadelphia, and Carti was recording the second version of Whole Lotta Red.

In late 2019 and early 2020, Carti recorded many tracks with his higher-pitched voice that he later scrapped due to public disapproval of his single, @ MEH, and his feature on Pain 1993. with Drake

The track was first previewed multiple times on April 16, 2021, later leading to it and its unfinished accompanying music video selling in a group-buy for $10,000. Cartier leaked in its entirety on April 19, 2021, and it is unlikely the track will ever see an official release.

Title: Lame Niggaz
Release Date: April 14, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-lame-niggaz-lyrics
Song Description: Lame Niggaz is a bouncy track detailing Carti expresses his disdain for individuals he perceives as unoriginal and derivative.

The song is rumored to be a response to rapper Tory Lanezs request for the beat from Cartis hit Magnolia to make a remix. However, producer Pierre Bourne declined Lanezs request, informing Carti about it. Carti and Bourne hit the studio to create Lame Niggaz as a direct response.

https://youtu.be/ZRbsOkTgJ4Y

also worth saying that the Z at the end of the song title is probably a way of mocking Tory Lanez, saying that he is lame.

Song Description: No Sl33p is the eighth track on Playboi Cartis sophomore studio album. This song was produced by Jonah Abraham and KP Beatz and is the first time they have worked with Carti.

Title: Butterfly Doors
Release Date: None, URL: https://genius.com/Playboi-carti-butterfly-doors-lyrics
Song Description: Butterfly Doors is an unreleased, unfinished song by Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti, which, judging from the OG filename  Butterfly Doors 8.9.18, was recorded on August 9, 2018, at the same session as Slick featuring RX PESO, Skeleton, and Goku. It was unheard until its online leak on September 4, 2019. The track is likely a throwaway from his second studio album Whole Lotta Red.

The melody of the beat, produced by Playboi Cartis frequent collaborator Pi'erre Bourne, is similar to Be Mine, from Pi'erres debut album The Life of Pi'erre 4, the fourth installment in his The Life of Pi'erre series of projects. It is unclear which beat was made first as it is unknown when Be Mine was made.
