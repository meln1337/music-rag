Artist: Future, Alternate Names: Meathead, Nayvadius DeMun Cash, Future Hendrix, Big Pluto, Nayvadius Cash, Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn, Nayvadius Wilburn, Nayvadius D. Wilburn, Future Hndrxx, The Wizrd
Artist Description: Nayvadius DeMun Cash (born November 20, 1983), professionally known as Future, is an American rapper and singer from Kirkwood, Atlanta, Georgia. He is signed to Epic Records. He is the cousin of Rocko and Rico Wade and a former associate of the Dungeon Family. He first rapped under the stage name Meathead.

Future has made himself known for his extensive use of auto-tune, producing a flurry of hit singles such as “Fuck Up Some Commas” and “Turn On The Lights,” among others.

Future is also known for his chorus singing on features such as “Buy The World,” “U.O.E.N.O,” “Loveeeeee Song” and “Pain.”

At one point, Future was engaged to singer Ciara and they had a child, Future Jr., but they broke up soon after—due to Future apparently not wanting a very extravagant wedding.

He is closely associated with well-known Atlanta producers DJ Esco, Southside, Metro Boomin, Sonny Digital & Zaytoven.

He’s the first artist in history to have back-to-back number one album debuts after releasing FUTURE and HNDRXX a week apart from each other in 2017.

Future earned his first number one song in his career with Drake’s 2021 hit “Way 2 Sexy.”

Title: Mask Off
Release Date: February 17, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Future-mask-off-lyrics
Song Description: Mask Off serves as a rags-to-riches story that explores the surface of Futures past, from trapping to living a life of luxury. The slow and syrupy production by Metro Boomin samples the 1976 song, Prison Song by Tommy Butler, which featured Carlton Williams.

The song went on to become one of Futures highest-charting singles ever, peaking at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is also certified 8X platinum by the RIAA.

The song also spawned the #MaskOffChallenge, which participants dance and play instruments to the song. It was a huge factor in the songs popularity.

The songs official music video was released on May 4, 2017, and two weeks later, on May 23, 2017, a remix featuring Kendrick Lamar was released.

Title: Low Life
Release Date: December 25, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Future-low-life-lyrics
Song Description: A lowlife is defined by Merriam-Webster as a bad person: person of low moral character.

The title of The Weeknd and Futures song suggests a reference to the words meaning, and their lyrics detail the activities they consider to be a part of a low life: drugs, alcohol, strippers, cheating, murder, and spending exorbitant amounts of money.

In addition to referencing the term lowlife, this song can be interpreted as a play on the term high life, generally understood as a luxurious lifestyle afforded to the rich and famous. As supporters of the low life, The Weeknd and Future turn high life accommodations into austere ones.

The Weeknd released Low Life as a Christmas gift for their fans after some teasing. His Pass Dat (Remix) was also included in the mini-release. Low Life was later revealed to be included on Futures album EVOL.

Lyrics:

Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush

[Verse: Drake]
Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say some'
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
Niggas gotta move off my release day, huh

I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her shit, it is what it is (What)
Said what I had to and did what I did (Ayy)
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid

Title: Comin Out Strong
Release Date: February 24, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Future-comin-out-strong-lyrics
Song Description: The Weeknd and Futures fourth collaboration. This song has both artists flexing and coming out strong despite haters and people that doubt them, that go out of their way to hinder their success.

Such people go as far as falsifying allegations against them, making stories up if they have none. They taunt haters throughout the song repeatedly asking do you know who I am? in each verse.

In the last verse Future also addresses his legal disputes against his former manager, Rocko.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
High Klassified な音楽
I got the jewels flooded from Ben, baby!

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, "Boy I think the money's startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, "Watch what they do for the ones"
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man, you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness

It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones (Yeah, comin')
'Cause now days if they don't got it they'll make one (Still comin')
The only time I feel alive when I take (Still comin')
I wanna vent but I know it ain't safe (Still comin')
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am? (Do you know who I am?)
Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? (Never say my name)
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am? (Give you my t-)
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (No videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (I invented)
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
They take my kindness for weakness

Lyrics:

[Intro: Future]
I don't wanna hear all that, I don't wanna hear none of that
Talkin' commas, how much you need and all that shit
Fuck that shit, I don't remember none of that shit

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 1: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, you went and switched sides?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on him?
Where your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 2: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? You came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was "What's the hold up?"
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we're paying back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and the commissary ain't gon' pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain't got no choice
'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at? Last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?

[Verse 4: Future]
60 for a walk through, bitch don't panic (Woo, walk, Fu—)
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage (Fall, savage)
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket (Swim, nigga, ha, ha)
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet (Slatt)
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt (Dog, Freeband—)
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was on my come-up? (At, come-up)
The reason I'm here today 'cause I ain't never gave up
[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

Title: Codeine Crazy
Release Date: October 28, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Future-codeine-crazy-lyrics
Song Description: Widely regarded as one of his best songs, Codeine Crazy is all about Futures experience with purple drank or leana recreational beverage consisting of codeine cough syrup and soda.

This track, and Monster as a whole, followed Futures break-up with his ex-fiance, Ciara, which seems to be the primary inspiration behind the song and its content. Future raps about drowning out his sorrows with substances and implicitly mentions his relationship troubles.

The song sounds celebratory as its delivered over a trippy and upbeat instrumental, but it addresses topics like suicide and loneliness, making it one of Futures most vulnerable records.

During a 2017 interview with HotNewHipHop, producer TM88 revealed that the beat was made for Nicki Minajs 2014 album, The Pinkprint, but after missing the deadline, it was sent to Future instead:

Future called, I think it was the next day or the next two days, and he was like, I need some beats. Im going in. [I] sent the whole pack, ended up getting a lot of stuff on Monster, and Codeine Crazy was one of them.

The music video was released on February 23, 2015. It was directed by Vincent Lou and tinged with purple filters and blurred visuals to mimic both the color of lean and its side-effects.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Codeine crazy
Yeah (8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)
Pourin' bubbly, pourin' bubbly
Pour that bubbly, pour that bubbly

Drink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it
Yeah, I'm covered in it

That ain't for you, dawg, that's for them other niggas
That ain't for you, shawty, that's for that other bitch
I'm going crazy 'bout it, I'm going codeine crazy
That's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely
I'm drinking bubbly
I'm drinking bubbly (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Take all my problems and drink out the bottle and fuck on a model, yeah
Audemars, this not a carnival, this is a Royal Oak Cartier
Dom Perignon, I get down from a brown, I get chauffeured around
I pour up with my rounds, I pour up out of town
I corrupted your town with them guns and them pounds
I grew up on the grounds with them dealers and hounds
We order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass 'em around
I say everything triple time
Rollie, AP, Hublot, triple time
I just know the ones you call upon
I just had to pay my dawg a bond
Looking at me like a triple threat
Every time a nigga talk, a check
Smoke the kush up like a cigarette
Run it back, you hear my intellect (8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)

Don't tell me you celibate to the mula

Abu Dhabi, nigga straight out the sewer
Like a loaded chopper, I'm 'bout to shoot it
I'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors
I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Take the lesson, put it all in the air
Too many days gone by
Sittin' by the phone, waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' on me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another sixty thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed
She sucked my dick, it got my brain washed
And for that shit, you got your man popped
See what they did to Biggie and Pac
Pour a lil', lil' liquor out, pour a lil' more liquor out
Pour it out, pour it out, pour it out

[Verse 3]
Drownin' in Actavis, suicide
When I hit the scene, it's homicide
Diamond pinky ring a lollipop
Fuck the hate, I pull up in a drop
Diamonds colder than a glacier
Ballin' harder than the Pacers
I been tryin' to have some patience
Told my mama she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gon' put a nigga name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it
I'm making USD's overseas
That's U.S. dollars that you can't achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said, "Nigga, please"
Fuck that white girl, she said, "Nigga, please"
Playin' poker, now we're back in Stroker
I forgot her name but her pussy soakin'
When I seen her on the pole
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin' myself that I'm still gettin' loaded
The coupe fully loaded, this whip fully loaded
This whip fully loaded, the clip fully loaded
I try to control it
Let's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles, these niggas too bogus
Let's pour up a pint, I'ma fuck around, faint like I'm Kid Cudi, probably
I fuck around, faint, I'ma fall on the drank
Rockin' Tom Ford, poppin' mollies
Married to this motherfuckin' money
[Chorus]
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy

[Verse 4]
You thought I forgot about us?
I know that you know I don't fold under pressure
I'm back on the road, I get low on the pedal
We live by the codes of the ghetto
I'm closing this out with my memo
I'm treating this shit like a demo
I'm putting my heart and my soul in this shit and some more
I'm in that Dolce Gabbana
I might get after Madonna
I get it crack in the summer
Strapped in the 'Lac and the Hummer
Fronted a pack to my partner
All this lingo got her panties to dropping
Fuck the fame, I'm sipping lean when I'm driving
All this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it
I'm an addict and I can't even hide it
Don't you panic, panoramic companion
They was tryna serve me at the arraignment
Never comment on it, never complaining
I'm taking everything that come with these millions
I'm taking everything that come with my children
Yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
Pour that bubbly
Drink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it
Yeah, I'm covered in it
I was thuggin' it, I was just loving lit
That's for them other niggas, that's for the other bitches
That ain't for you, dawg, that's for them other niggas

Title: I Won
Release Date: April 8, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Future-i-won-lyrics
Song Description: Originally dubbed Trophy Wife, this Metro Boomin-produced track finds Future and Yeezy toasting to the sweetest of arm candies over clashing snares and elephant feet drums. It even has its own game.

I Won isnt usually a term of endearment, but Future and Kanye West  both of whom are engaged to beautiful, famous women and are fathering children with them  built an entire song on the concept that theres nothing more romantic than being dubbed lifes grand prize, having a person to spend the rest of their life with.

Future on working with Kanye:

Thats rare when you get a Kanye verse back in one day, so you know its one of them records when he does the verse and sends it back in 24 hours. Thats the icing on the cake with the album.
Lyrics:

[Chorus: Future]
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
A trophy, I won me a trophy
I won, I won, I won a trophy
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
Trophy, I won me a trophy
A trophy, I won me a trophy
Trophy, I won me a trophy
A trophy

[Verse 1: Future]
Get to fuckin' on the dresser just to make that pussy wetter
Gotta put you in that vintage then you rockin' Perry Ellis
Then I leave with you, only cause I believe in you
We get to bangin' on the walls just to piss the neighbors off
You and them 12 foot ceilings, I just painted the halls
So I can breathe with you
I want to live my dream with you
You say that money don't matter it's the times and the memories
And now that ass gettin' fatter and I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me, got you in custody
Whoever knockin' at the door, they gotta wait 'til we finished
I know I started at the bottom but that ain't where we endin'

So it's only right to live the trophy life
You grew up on J. Lo, Timberlands by Manolo now
'Til one day I put an angel in your ultrasound
I wanna dip that ass in gold, I wanna dip that ass in gold
I made it over NBA, NFL players
So every time I score it's like the Super Bowl
Baby, we should hit the south of France
So you could run around without them pants
I put that glacier on your little hand
Now that's the only thing without a tan
My trophy on that Bound bike, I gave you only pipe
If people don't hate then it won't be right
You could look at Kylie, Kendall, Kourtney and Khloe
All your Mama ever made was trophies, right?
[Chorus: Future]
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion

Title: Thought It Was a Drought
Release Date: July 17, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Future-thought-it-was-a-drought-lyrics
Song Description: Thought It Was A Drought kicks off the DS2 album where Future speaks on his love for cough syrup, speaks on his drug-dealing come-up & successes, while subtly dropping hints towards his break-up with Ciara.

In this case, the drought is the lack of Actavis cough syrup since it was removed from the market following its numerous references in music. Future isnt experiencing the drought because hes well-connected.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Uh, WIZRD
Dirty soda, Spike Lee
White girl, Ice T
Fully loaded AP, yeah

[Chorus]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
I had to make me a cot
Now I called a contractor to make me a spot
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there’s too much to hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at, niggas know I ain't lying
Niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym
I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change, ayy

We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Verse 2]
I strapped the dope to your spouse
The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her, "Bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout"
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I’m working on having some manners
I’m thinking about it right now
I’m holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air
[Chorus]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Outro]
Thought it was a drought, thought it, thought it was a drought
We thought it was a drought, we poured an Actavis
Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you

Eyes getting low but I'm still observing, I see you lurking
Never see me out in person, I'm always working
Money on your head if you make a nigga nervous

Making sure that they all good before they close the curtain

You grab your strap, nigga
Only time you get down on your knees
Shooting craps, nigga
Fuck what you heard, God blessin' all the trap niggas
God blessin' all the trap niggas

[Verse 1]
Weighed 1008 grams on the scale
I got a lower case T across my chest
Your crack house doin' numbers then you blessed
You move your momma to a crib from the 'jects
It's so much alcohol and kush on my breath
We prayin' five times a day to catch a plug
A few bean pies stashed in the trunk
Shoot dice all day and sell dust
You loaded up, they talkin' shit, you gone bust
Told yourself a million times, you don't give a fuck
Sold over a million dimes, hangin' in the cut
Sold over a million dimes, I don't give a fuck
What?

Hasta Ia-la-uego wake up with that Glock, okay though
Stash the dope inside a Winnebago in Decatur
You got your work, you posted up in the hood Bodega
Lil' woadie loading up that yopper before he brush his teeth
Gotta roll a backwood up while he count the cheese
We on the turf, getting active on the backstreet
I'm drinkin' Actavis, the only thing that relax me
I'm on drugs, every single day I pop a seal
We talk that lingo 'round here, we try to work a deal
You pull up round here, they serve you here to Dixie Hills
You hit Old Nat, I know on Godby you’ll see a trap house
Gotta cock it back, out here this shit wid-ild

I told you it was a true love
I ended up with temptations
You goin' out the country
You posting up on IG
I'm laid up with my sidepiece

Now tell me you don't want me
Tell me that the pussy ain't mines no more
Tell me you moving on and you don't love me no more

Re-rockin' the dope, soon as it get off the boat
Keepin' it soft like a mink
Gold on my link, coke in the sink
Choppin' that work like karate
Servin' a new Maserati, in a brand new Maserati
That's a whole lot of new money
Snatch it, then hide it from the 12
Movin' them squares and them bales
Servin' the rawest of yayo
Beating that china like Kunta Kinte
Whippin' it, whippin' that fish and Parkay
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss, a boss and a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood
Bakin' soda water splash the scales
Fork in my right and my pot in my left
Leanin' all the way over to the side
I whip me a four way to a nine

Young enough to still sell dope
But old enough that I knows better
When they sayin' it's 42 for that white powder, I knows better
Get it, nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever
And flood their Rollie till the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tails
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH! Look at the clues
The J's, the jewels, I'm actin' a monkey
From 16 years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies

My dinner plates, no silverware, all you niggas my hijos
Toss a kilo like a free throw, crack house, it had the peephole
Made it through to the other side
Now nothing's big as my ego, Push

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
Me, I try to leave the best for later
But Pusha tried to put me on the respirator
The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite
Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship
She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes
That's Comme des Garçons and the Buffalo
I know guerrillas with the triggers that's on a banana clip
And packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knocking over vehicles
These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea, niggas
These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas
These niggas hit the weed then they lean niggas, gee, nigga
If you got two hoes, you need to let one go
Two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro
There's an eye in the sky, I'm tryna let y'all know
Ain't no standards, I'ma set one though
Big ass bag but no man sandals
All that war, we need to let that go
That boom business, I'ma get that ho

[Verse 4: Casino]
Young nigga got that coke, whip that dope like a bad child
How you think about that coupe with no roof?
Young nigga cashed out
Popped so many Percs, popped so many Xans
Young nigga 'bout to pass out
12 jump behind me, I got some in the car
Young nigga 'bout to smash out
Migo hit that line, say he got some bricks
Young fresh 'bout to buy 'em out
QuikTrip 'round the corner, dropped a nine
Got the J's in the lunch line smokin' iron
Cocaine, cocaine cowboy, like Mickey Munday
Take over the project, whip a line, me no wait
I keep a .45 in my coat while I'm servin' dope
The J's in my hood smoke that crack, say it give 'em hope
Serve a nigga whole brick, he hopin' that it come and go
Young nigga tricked up
Now he spendin' that money with Casino!

They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk

[Chorus]
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us ‘cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

[Verse 1]
They came through with a stick and you heard it
They came through in this bitch and they were swerving
I can't believe the blood ain't on my shirt
Because he got hit close-range

We be talking lick talk, and I'ma fuck your bitch too

Riding in a car I barely can pronounce
Ordered up a chauffeur, told him, "ride me round the whole world"
I was on the E-way with that molly and that old girl
Get a little cheaper, you could win
Hit it little harder, get the Benz

[Chorus: Future & Tems]
I can hеar your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at yourself 'cause you can't leave me alone
Gossip, bein' messy, that ain't what we doin' (World was endin')

Over the phone, droppin' tears (Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah)
I get more vulnerable when I do pills (Tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah)
When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I won't wait for you, for you)
When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I won't wait for you, I won't wait for you)
Need to tell a real one exactly what it is (I won't wait, won't wait, for you, for you)

Made me shake his hand when y'all been fuckin' for a minute (I won't wait for you, for you)
Walk me off the plank because you know that I'm a swimmer (I won't wait for you)
Supposed to be your dog, but you done put me in a kennel
Girl, put a muzzle on it, all that barkin' over dinner
I was fuckin' with you when you had the tiny Presidential
You got better when you met me and that ain't coincidental
Tried to bring the best out you, guess I'm not that influential
Guess I'm not the one that's meant for you

[Chorus: Drake, Tems & Future]
I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone

Lookin' like Pancho, lookin' like Pedro
Money tree from Tarzan
Ten dividends gon' grow when I say "grow"

Havin' heart, I can't tell (Wait)
Half of y'all might need help (Wait)
I might fall in Rodeo (Bitch)
I might ball in Australia (Say no more)
I might call her for real (Say no more)

Platinum, platinum, platinum
Gotta look at self and ask, "What happened?"
How y'all let a conscious nigga go commercial
While only makin' conscious albums?
How y'all let the braids on TV?
How y'all let the hood at the table?
Now y'all don't even know how to rate him
Niggas lookin' like I'm a Create-A-Player
Everybody who didn't pay respect
Gotta 'fess up now and pay ya debts
Gotta lay somethin' down if makin' threats
Gotta say somethin' now, don't hold ya breath
I mean, I'm floatin', I got the sauce, got the potion
I got 'em all in convulsions and emotions
I put careers in negotions and put the body in the ocean
I made an oath when my nigga told me to go in
Then he died on a cold bench
All my old friends livin' life on a slow end
Gotta keep shit rollin', it's deep (It's deep, it's deep, it's deep)
I done fucked so much, I can't sleep (I can't sleep, I can't sleep)
I done fucked so much, I'm retired (Swear to God, swear to God)
I'm 'bout to live my life through Dave Free (Swear to God, swear to God)
She said she broke down when Prince died (It's alright)
Bitch, my hair down, Prince live through me (I am Prince)
Get your ass up and be inspired (Get inspired)
You know how many bodies in the street? (How many?)
Take the mask off so you can see

I hope you ain't catchin' feelings for no bitch who fucked the crew
You know I'm independent, get the 'rillo, bust a jug

Title: Turn On the Lights
Release Date: April 13, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Future-turn-on-the-lights-lyrics
Song Description: A full quarter of Turn On the Lights passes before the beat finally drops, but its that floaty and ambient structure that makes Futures longing so articulate.

It also made a surprise hit for both the artist and its producerMike WiLL Made It. The track hit #2 on the R&B/Hip-Hop charts, effectively launching both of their careers. In a Complex interview, Mike WiLL said of the song:

Future was like, Man, basically youre telling me to sing it. What are you trying to turn me into, an R&B singer? I was like, Bob Marley wasnt no R&B singer. You know youre not an R&B singer. You just got an ill tone.

The breakthrough helped define Futures strange and lyrical sound, setting the stage for another equally successful single, a star-studded sophomore album, and a new movement in hip-hop, one that stretches from Young Thug to Desiigner. Yet despite both collaborators' tremendous futures, Turn On the Lights remains unique in its sound and vision.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I'm lookin' for 'er
I'm lookin' for 'er
I'm lookin' for 'er

[Verse 1]
Is that her in the VIP-line
With the Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive a Nissan now she in a Bimmer
I don't want 'er cause she from the corner
And I heard that Bimmer was a loaner
Her old man, the owner
And don't even drink Corona's
What type of drink you want bruh
On champagne forever
On dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me
If you'd like to change the weather
If you wanna live better
We can buy a crib, where ever
Don't get too thirsty, get used to the cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see 'er 'fore I do tell 'er I wish that I've met 'er

[Chorus]
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain't gon' cheat and she gon' never make no move

I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion
I heard that she a precious jewel, you treat her to medallions
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to prowlin'
And if I get her number, you know I can't wait to dial it
And if we get together, girl, you know we gon' be wildin'
And when we get together we make magic and it’s ours
Whenever you up here, ain't nun nobody can do about it

She a hood girl
But she a good girl
She been mislead
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
I've tried to go to sleep
And seen 'er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today I'ma stay clean
Just in case you recognize her face, send 'er to me
And tell 'er I’ve been lookin' for 'er with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin' because I got my cash right
And tell 'er if she honest I promise to stay true
Make sure, when you tell 'er, tell 'er we goin' past the moon

[Chorus]
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too

Money keep a nigga motivated
Molly keep a nigga motivated
Percocet keep 'em motivated
Good drank keep a nigga motivated
Lortabs on my conversation
Talk a lot of bands then we conversatin'

In the paddie wagon and it had me numb
The pain from the slum had me numb
Tryna sell some dope and eat caviar
Got the passport in Saudi Arabia
We've been flossing in medallions
We ain't nothing but some Talibans
I pull up right now and embarrass ya
I've just been hanging with savages
Lately I've been hanging around with my savages
I grew up on the block, one hunnid
I go on The Bluff, it's one hunnid
I done did enough in the jungle
I done put in some work and they love me
When I drink out the cup, it's so dirty
Had the blow at the store, they was lurking
Poured a four in a cup it was breakfast
Sprinkled sauce in my drink and I took it

Chop it up with a sack chaser
Told you I wasn't going back, baby
Hanging out with some crack babies
Fell in love with this cash baby
Money touch a niggas hands
On a few Xans might won't count it
Spend it all in one night
If we could rewind it, we'll still do it
I'm true to this game, I jump on a plane
And run to the stage
I've been working some years for this
Making music, I live for this
Hit the trap in my Louboutins
Count it up then I bag up a brick
Mount it up then I smash out in it
You know I'm gon' do the whole dash in this motherfucker

Back in the day, when a nigga sell dope
I'ma slap your daddy out and then put him in a hole
Glock 40, woo
Turn up, turn up
My ambitions as a rider
Sippin' on lean, getting higher
Nigga, I'm a codeine buyer
No, you not a foreign whip driver
Shout out to the shooters and the shooters only
You never walk around with a lot of money
Hundred dollars fallin' all out your pocket
When you hit 'em in the head, can you keep it solid?
Bulletproof whip, we'll blow it up
Like some raw uncut dope, blow it up
Represent your gang, nigga, throw it up

Presidential Rollie and it's glidin'
Love a nigga wrist when it's shinin'
Hate a nigga wrist when it's blingin'
So I went and added more diamonds
Hot Boy, nigga, BG
That's the way these young niggas eat
Drinking on syrup, can't sleep
Keep it copacetic with your partner
Blockbuster niggas running 'round with real choppers
Nigga, what's the color of them bottles? they ain't gold
And you moving 'round with ya ho
You ain't even sticking to the code
Pimps up, pimps up, Hoes down (Hoes down)
A pool full of money and I'm 'bout to drown
I'ma fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Button up suits at the Grammys
Had to turn it up for the family

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Purple Reign
Wizard

Thinkin' about them licks I hit, I had to
Thinkin' about if you was here, I had you
Savage
Gon' roll it up, my nigga
Roll up, jump out the car, and squeeze the trigger
Gon' roll it up, my nigga
Roll up, hop out the car, and squeeze the trigger

[Chorus]
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Perkies callin'

I can hear the Xannies callin'
I can hear them Percs callin'
I can hear the workers callin'
I can hear the streets callin'
I can hear the streets callin'

[Verse 1]
Thinkin' about them licks I hit, I had to
Thinkin' about if you was here, I had you
Thinkin' about that cash like it's fast food
I'm thinkin' about this cash like it's fast food
I'm payin' all my tithes, receivin' bad news
Lord, forgive me for my sins, I know this cash rules
Everything around me turn to fast food
Standin' in the cold, I ain't got no blanket
These hoes always gettin' exposed, ain't got home trainin'
And when I push up in that Rolls and I'm still drankin'
Went from standin' over stoves to the tour bus
Stayed down, ten toes, board the G5
So much yellow gold on me like a beehive
Started rockin' Balmain's like they Levi's
Over time, the booth is like a gold mine
I served in Alabama like Roll Tide

When I whip that Bimmer, can't you picture me rollin'?
Fuck you pussy niggas, ain't no sympathy
Niggas tellin' lies, they so feminine
I be sellin' pies, chasin' M&Ms
Fuck a nine-to-five, get it out the gym
Push illegal weight, we call it out the gym
Knock 'em off on tape, that's murder on film
I need better thoughts, I need better vibes
Focus on the top and let my nigga slide
I need more advice and ain't got no time
Hustlin', do right, feel like I waited a lifetime
Weigh up both sides 'cause your life ain't like mines
Pay me no mind, I ain't payin' no fine
Everything I did was for my hood this whole time
I'm talkin' this whole time, for my hood this whole time
Gotta take advantage, gotta learn how to take advantage, dog
Stole a golf cart, I go and buy a ballpark
Drove a stolen car and now my car a push start
I'm from the apartments, my crib big like Wal-Mart
[Chorus]
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Perkies callin'

Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billie Jean

[Verse 1: Future]
Got a Panamera round a young nigga neck
Got a young bitch pulling up in a 'Vette
Smoke a lot of kush and I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
Bitch nigga get money, nigga, get back
Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whip a Maserati, pulling up a donk
50 thousand on yo watch, young nigga, splurge
Pop a Ace of Spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
Keep a young nigga workin', gotta buss a cape

[Verse 2: Future]
Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a Spyder
Young nigga play with keys like a typewriter
Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idol
I was never snitching, I can put it on the Bible
In a four-door Bimmer, driving with a rifle
Nigga, where you at? nigga, we gon' pull up on ya
Young bitch looking like Janet in the '80s
We was grinding up from a tube and a baby
Got the girl dripping wet like a Jheri curl
Got a styrofoam cup and it's full of syrup
Send it over from Lil' Mexico and let me work
I can get 36 for a clean shirt

[Chorus: Future]

Pop a lot of pain pills
'Bout to put rims on my skateboard wheels

Beat that pussy up like Emmett Till
Yeah
Two cell phones ringin' at the same time
That's your ho callin' from two different phones
Tell that bitch, "Leave me the fuck alone!"
See, you fuck her wrong, and I fuck her long
I got a love-hate relationship with Molly
I'd rather pop a ollie and my dick is a trolley
Boy, I'll bury you like Halle
And these hoes say I'm blind
'Cause I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Man, I just received a package
Them other niggas taxin'
And my pockets so fat, I'm startin' to feel contractions
And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
And he already home, man, that nigga must be snitchin'
Cut him off like karate

[Chorus: Future]
Ayy
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in a new 'Rari
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean

Lyrics:

[Intro]
I've been in the stu late, workin', no residuals
If we never speak again, I'm just glad I got to tell the truth
I ain't done countin'
You wanna come to paradise?
Matter of fact, you wanna come to Pluto?
Ha-ha

[Verse 1]
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
She got a few athletes on speed dial
I'm tryna get the case dismissed before I see trial
And these codeine habits ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
No this codeine ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
I used to sell dope at my grandma's house, as a rude child
All these cameras on, fuckin' with my mood, wild
And these chains clinkin' back and forth, they too loud
They know damn well this wasn't promised
I know damn well this must be karma
Left every pair of Margielas at the condo
Technically I never packed up and leave
Left eighty racks in the dresser, you can keep
And I got this bad ting at disposal
I cooked it up and then I went global
My baby mama push a Range Rover
Had to make sure I got it fully loaded
Can't be the one and then you get exposed
If you the one, then God will let me know
But at the same time, I like to vibe with one
I'm paranoid, I gotta ride with one
And I had to 'splain to her last night
Had to send this one freak on the last flight
You might also like[Segue]
Had to send this one freak on the last flight

[Chorus]
Won't get a response from me, ain't no confessions
Before I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'
Any time I got you, girl you my possession
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection

[Verse 2]
Standin' on Black Sox, meet me at the yacht dock
Icin' out the clock, watch, bitches on my cock
Yeah, maybe it's the drop, yeah, we get in our feelings, yeah
I don't know how you would feel about if I ain't have millions, yeah
I'm conversin' with you, I hope you hear me, yeah
Keep my promise, take my love with you everywhere
And hell no, it ain't about no braggin' rights
But even if it was, shit, I got it
Pinstripes on a hardtop Bugatti
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
I'ma keep it genuine and tell the truth to you
I got this jawn, she know what to do with me
And right now I don't know what to do with you
I don't wanna sound like I'm bein' rude with you
She caught a red eye, leavin' L.A
I shoulda gave her to the valet
And I had to tell her 'bout Miami
After she came with no panty
[Chorus]
Won't get a response from me, ain't no confessions
Before I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'
Any time I got you, girl you my possession
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection21Embed

My passion is a movie, I say fuck her 'cause I screwed her
I stay on Miley Cyrus, everywhere I go I'm screwed up
I know my Texas niggas got my back and that's for sure though
Sippin' on Easter Pink like it's Tanqueray
We ain't never gon' give this perfect life up
I know the boys saying they gettin' to the money over there
Baby, trust me, these niggas nothin' like us
I put charisma in my lingo and she fell for me
I gave her realness, and that’s all she gonna get from me
Bona fide superstar, I'm straight up out the hood-uh
I just did a dose of Percocets with some strippers

Got a chain hangin' over me
God watching over me, all my angels watch over me
I bag it like groceries, keep some cash flowing over me
Got some money all in my hand and I stack it all under me
The young niggas under me, they gon' stand up in any war
We built this shit ground up like the head of a seminar
I talk for the real ones
I talk for them niggas that feel this shit out in Belgium
Freeband Gang

I just poured this lean in my cup like it's liquor

[Chorus]
Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be that way
Ain't mean to desert you
Sorry that it looked that way
Ain't really tryna hurt you

Ain't really tryna hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be that way
Ain't really tryin'
I ain't really tryin'

[Verse 1]
I was in the U.K. thinkin', shit don't feel the same
Addy got me daydreamin', hope I ain't goin' insane
Hard to say you care about me
When this mink draggin' to the floor
Tryna find a PYT, I already got some at home
I breathe the air she breathes
It's hard to breathe on my own
It's somethin' 'bout infidelity
Make me check every single stone
Gotta drink my blood like a Hebrew
'Cause I've been gettin' fly, since Evisu
Made her switch sides in Ibiza
I can get you off in Belgium
Diamonds shinin' off very seldom
Grab a couple chickens, then mail them
Take 'em to the hood, then sell them
Fam come first, you never fail them
Rebellious, always respect my elders
That's why I might treat you like I'm careless
Sold crack to a pregnant lady
Forgive me for the crack baby
If I open up my eyes, it turn black for real
Pack was too small, I ain't have it vacuum sealed
Word to Uncle Charles, nigga I got the sack for real
Money, broads, lawyers cost a half a mil'
Fame change, the family loves the way it is
Fame change, a ho loves the way I give
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal

Ain't really tryin'

[Verse 2]
It can get scary when you legendary
Caramel complexion, that's a Halle Berry
Cash rules everything around music
The game doped up, every nigga usin'
Grab the fuckin' carbon, hit him with the tool
I'm not tryna argue, I got issues
You see what I've been put up against, baby
You see why I've been tryna make the rent, baby
Tryna keep you closer than lint, baby
Dime rose, 'bout to get lynched, baby
It's hard to caress you
All your bad energy, it's hard to bless you
Commercial flights gettin' too hectic
V12 motors, my confession
Tryna identify, you look sketchy
I'm a real nigga, it's hard to accept me
[Chorus]
Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really tryin'

[Verse 3]
Hot tenderoni, Bobby Brown ooh
Shawty so phony, I got somethin' to prove
Work every day like I got somethin' to lose
Oxycont' got me flown up, nothin' new
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Money stacked up and it got me seduced
I got that hot dope, but I got that boost though
Ayy, my Lamb hit a pothole
These bitches some thot hoes
I hit the lotto in South Africano
Yacht party, sittin' at the dock of the condo
Better not be late, bitch, you better come pronto!
Better come with a combo
Asian persuasion, Cubana, mi ana
Yolanda, Sholanda, Miyana, mi casa
I don't know Spanish, I barely talk proper
It became problems when I didn't send flowers
King like Mufasa, messiah, then higher
Goshies and Rollies, yeah, fuck all the police
Shout out my woadie, he smashin' the C.O
My wrist got an ego, my watch in an igloo
We took illegal, got stripes like a zebru
Pimp like a rollin' stone, high when I greet you
Diamonds just fall on you, effortlessly ball on you
L-O-to-V-E, hope you ain’t get greedy
Chasers do numbers, man chains is on Fiji
Kidnapped your heart 'cause you gave it too easy
Diamonds on sight is way brighter than Geezy
Shout out to DiDi, got goonies on speedy
She like it rated, ain't nothin' 'bout her PG
I had it, made it, I thought I was jaded
Persian, Malaysian? Super sensation
Yah, sushi was raw when she got confiscated
No invitations, we showed up and made it
Long as my dawgs here, bitches betrayed me
Pigeons contagious, I shoulda known it
I turned the pages, heavily sedated
Too many clone me, too many phonies
Armani on me, you never warned me
How can you blame us when we all out the trenches?
Gold chains and rings, they're so easily gettin' offended
Spendin' all your show money tryna keep up with my image
Fuck around, take a O from me, and never give a penny
Fuck y'all, I skrrt off, 'cause everything shitty
I hit my first model, stepped up my pimpin'
Caught her off the runway, she instantly committed
Paper got my mind gone, too caught up on my city
In and out of time zones, runnin' up a billi'
Indian Cherokee, clarity, shinin' is therapy
Mami Israeli (Mami Israeli)

Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way

Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you

Sorry it's gotta be that way

Lyrics:

[Part I]

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Say she want to eat sushi, I gave her enough to go shoppin'
Anything she want, she cashin' out without no problems
How you gon' love a nigga that ain't got love for your mama?
You can die today, it ain't gon' save me nothin' but drama (Super)

[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual (Like usual)
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up

[Verse: Future]
Pluto
Help me fight my demons off, know the usual
I had put a chopper in her name and a Ruger
She hang on the block where I hang like a shooter
Throwed away a cougar, she didn't wanna leave
Treat her like garbage, my heart was on my sleeve
Should've chose better with your company at least
Why should I have love for her if you can get it out the creep?
Why should I have trust for you? You ain't get it out the creek
Why should I have love for you? You ain't kneelin' to my feet
Why should I be carin' when I know I can't be beat?
See how the ice be glarin' when I come through and retrieve
It's easy to know it's us if a body in the street
Too turned up and the plug talk Swahili
After I pay my taxes, I go Richard Mille
In another tax bracket, you niggas beneath me
Who causin' a racket in Jamaica on the weekend?
Half a ticket on vacation, I ripped up the receipt
And she call me daddy 'cause my money long like Stevie
Stay down with my son, right or wrong, FBG shit (Freebandz)
How you gon' be gang? You bang if you rich, what's in your bloodline?
Come in with some Talibans, everythin' gettin' gunned down
Halloween gang in this bitch, shit gettin' scary
Three hundred thousand for the cheapest ring, cost a Bentley truck, I'm legendary, lil' bitch
Hot, off the thermometer, lil' bitch
Hotter than fish grease, lil' bitch
My ring cost a big B as well as my wrist
I'm gettin' money like this, can't tell problems exist
I wake up fresh every day like I'm goin' to take a pic
Hermes hit my main line 'cause they know I'm lit
Stuffed a hundred-fifty racks in your purse, lil' bitch
And when I wake up, go surf in your pussy, hit

Say she wanna eat sushi, I gave her enough to go shoppin'
Switchin' up my bitch, I leveled up and went exotic
How you gon' love a nigga that ain't buyin' a Birkin for your mama?
You can die today, I swear I still won't break my promise (Pluto)

[Chorus: Future]
Make love on the weekend as usual
Take drugs, goin' up, oh, that's usual
Every time she come, big spender
Every time I put my chains on, big spender

[Interlude: Future]
It's cool, man, got red bottoms on
Life is good, you know what I mean? Like

[Part II]

[Chorus: Future]
Yeah, hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain and Audemar-ed the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo
I was in the trap servin' cocaine, I ain't been the same since

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
I can't entertain all that flodgin'
I ain't been the same since they crossed me
You know how they do when you poppin'
You know Baby can't do all that talkin'
I got fools tryna sue up in Boston
I got dudes tryna sue down in Florida
I got hoes in L.A., got a new boo from Georgia
A milli', saved up to give to my daughter
Over one hundred K to Drew Findling, my lawyer (Let's go)
Six digits on cases, we beat it like Tina (Mmh)
Baby all on the TV, that's easy
I mixed mid with the gas and I bought me a Bimmer (Yeah)

I know she gon' fuck, I ain't askin' (Uh-huh)
F&N like a prop, this shit plastic (Phew)
Fuck around and get popped just for laughin' (Boom)
Put that boy in a box, pick a casket
I go take that ho to Dior, pick a shoe (Let's go)
Kickin' shit with your whore, that's my boo
You can go put hardwood on the floor with the hoop (Hoop)
We like uppin' the score, we gon' shoot (Ball)
I never pick up when she call me (Brr, brr)
Help the bitch start a business, she bossin' (Uh-huh)
Like to wake up to sex like it's coffee (Sex)
Big baguettes on my neck, this shit cost me
Cartier, Audemar, Audemar or the Rolex (Let's go)
I been broke before, bet I won't go back
When she walk through the door, take that iron, make her hold that (Hold that)
They ain't seen me go out like a ho yet (Ho)
You know these lil' niggas got ho ways
Make 'em come air it out like the old days (Uh-huh)

My boy off a pill, need an OJ (Yeah, bitch)
[Chorus: Future & Lil Baby]
Hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo

Spent thirty racks on a rap bitch, could've went and bought a brick, woah

Got somethin' to lose so I stay with a shooter
Got game from a GOAT, I know how to maneuver
She kinda cute, really somethin' to do
I got somethin' to do, so I gave her to Pluto, huh
Hundred thousand for a body, go inside the house and everybody get it, huh
Got a plug on exotic, overnight 'em, floodin' everybody's city
Extra three-fifty, might buy me a Richie
This shit gettin' ridiculous, sip syrup wrong, get sick
Spot in Toronto, just show me the real ones
Give me a few months, I'll be servin' the 6, woah
Rolls truck, four bucks, all white guts, call it good luck, woah
Neck lit, wrist lit, look, don't touch, reach, you get busted
Hop out a Phantom, they think it's Houdini
Seven-fifty one day, I bought two Lamborghinis
Hundred racks spent on a four carat diamond
I didn't propose, but I bought her a ring
They had my bro, had to let that boy go
He had stick to the code, he ain't tell 'em a thing, uh
Ballin' like we won a championship, yeah
Everybody get a ring, huh
[Chorus: Future]
Yeah, hundred thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain and Audemar-ed the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo

Song Description: Future details the hardships that resulted from his friend DJ Esco getting locked up in Dubai for 56 nights for possessing cannabis.

The official video was released on July 30th, 2015.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYuxqiKVLhg&feature=youtu.be
Lyrics:

[Intro]
My uncle Ronnie used to wash cars
My uncle Wayne was a kingpin, you know what I'm saying?
My uncle Don, that nigga used to rob banks and shit, rest in peace
My granddaddy was a boss, he was a kingpin, you heard?

[Chorus]
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'

[Interlude 1]
Dropped Monster tape and had to go to Europe

[Verse 1]
Best thing I ever did was fall out of love
'Sco came to me, said, "They think you washed up
You need to go back in, show these niggas who the one"
We going back in soon as we get off tour
He had my hard drive on him when he caught the case
When they took him into custody, they took my life away
You might also like[Interlude 2]
People didn't even understand that
My hard drives that I recorded all my music on
For two years straight was on this...
Was on this one hard drive that Esco had
And he was locked up with it
So I had to record new music
That's when I did Beast Mode

[Verse 2]
I'm fresh off the plane on them Zaytiggys
I endured so much pain, ain't got 'Sco with me
Ain't got nobody to smoke one or pour with me
Niggas rocked the lean, man, when I was OT
And I'm still dealin' with the time they gave Doe B
How he gon' catch an armed robbery around me?
And my lifestyle getting way bigger
I got so much love for my niggas
Brown paper bag, we gettin' back to the paper
Gettin' back to the basics
Everything I did, it was premeditated
I just knew there'd come a time when I finally did make it
And some niggas started hatin'
I ain't never had no problem with these niggas
I've been about my guala from the dodo
Got an R&B chick layin' on me, no photo
Got a combo in the condo doin' some real life porno
[Bridge]
And I ain't worried 'bout nothin' in the world, keep a badass bitch
These niggas ain't none of my worries, damn that shit
There's so much more I gotta endure
I just had my baby, gotta go on tour (fuck that shit)

[Chorus]
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'

[Verse 3]
I ain't holding this back, I ain't holding this
The music way ahead of its time and I notice this
Get back in the studio, give 'em what they was missing
They didn't know I knew the game and I know how to reinvent it
They ain't know me in the cut, they just know me from rhymin'
My hard work finally catchin' up with perfect timin'

[Interlude 3]
You know what I'm saying
I could take a hundred dollar slab
And goddamn make three hundred off that bitch, you dig?
[Chorus]
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'

[Outro]
Everything in the streets
It prepared me for everything that I'm going through right now
The good and the bad, you know what I'm saying?
Can't let none of this shit get to me
I go harder 'cause I know where I was at
And I know where I wanna go45Embed

They don't look at you like you the same nigga
I just hope I can remain humble
Hop out a Ghost in the jungle, I did it
Sell all the dope out them apartments, I did it
I'm 'bout to cut off some niggas I know that ain't with me
Runnin' with niggas that wanna see niggas
That get it and niggas who strive
And the real niggas is all they come across, yeah
I know either way it goes, Sunny gon' be there
I know either way it goes, Doe Boy gon' be there (Young Metro!)
Even when a nigga was broke, Scooter was always there

I knew there'd come a time when we'd all be here

Title: Never Gon Lose
Release Date: March 21, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Future-never-gon-lose-lyrics
Song Description: Interestingly, this track was inspired by real events. It was dedicated to a DJ nicknamed DJ Esco, who spent 56 nights in custody in Dubai for possessing a small amount of drugs. This experience influenced Future and was part of the inspiration for the album.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah
This bitch from Australian and I'm an alien
(808 Mafia)

[Chorus]
I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy, but I love it, baby
When I jump out the whip, when I hop out the whip then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, and I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink 'til I pass out, I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch, then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter in the sewer, the streets turned a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger, I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super 'cause she got that super
When I say super, that's young Super Future
We never gon' lose, we never gon' lose

[Verse]
Never gon' lose 'cause these bitches gon' choose
These bitches gon' be who they is
Walkin' and talkin' like classy
You a ho to your heart, you a ho to your heart
You know I'll be workin' that boy, I'ma pour it
Servin' that boy out the back of the yard
Fuck on your ho, I'm just playin' my cards
Whip after whip put up in the garage
Sip on the lean like a fifth of the dark
Hop in the Spur, then might hop in the Porsche
Telly then rally and gather the squad
Yeah, girl eat the squad
Me and my niggas so mothafuckin' tight
You can't even tell us apart
Fuck a bitch every single damn night
Ain't nothin' but an avatar
Valet the car on the curb like I'm swervin' on alcohol
Get to poppin' them Percocets and Xanax like they some Tylenol
I remember nights in Europe sayin' we ain't fallin' off
I'm on a lot of green, we gotta have some green
When I hit the plane and I board it
I got a magazine with no Visine
Just ridin' around with this .40
She gon' thug for me, she gon' thug for me
In Ohio, that's my shorty
We ain't playin' around
These diamond rings gon' go upside your noggin
You see they try sabotage me, then copy
They wasn't playin' fair no-no, no-no, no-no
Bitch is a bozo, she clown in the photos
We sell that coco, you talkin' to po-po
You know that's a no, though, you know that's a no-no
Know that's a no-no, no-no-no, no-no-no
Came at the door, pour, serve out the paddy door
Bitch I'm your man and your daddy, ho
Panty droppers had no panties on
Bitch, you steppin' in, no panties on
Back with these stallions
Back-to-back, back, back-to-back with these stallions
Like she trunk after trunk, I just carry on
Got the sack on me, now I just carry it
Got some M's in New Orleans, I buried it
For the cash and some M's, I'll marry it
See the way they just jumped on the bandwagon
Went bought a G-Wagen
Fifty-six nights, I had to get at it
Mayweather, Pacquiao, nigga, we still at it
Get up and get at it, guns like I'm Bin Laden

Song Description: While this song dropped already in October 2014, Future released the official video to this Will-A-Fool produced banger on January 26, 2015.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I be on the phone with Doe Boy, I be telling him
He inspired me to go harder
You know what I'm saying? Real talk
Will-Will-Will-William

[Verse 1]
My savages, my savages, my savages
I'm always dressing fresher than a mannequin
I grew up in a ruthless ass environment
I'm on the phone with Yo, I ask him how the trial went
Thirty-five racks is how my day was spent
I gotta cock it back, that's how my day would get
You got me thinking all these bitches artificial
The way you acting, you must don't respect a real nigga
Roll some herb up, pour some syrup up
They tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us
I told you way before what happened, they was hating on us
You know when we was jugging for it they was mad at us
Ayy, this a letter for my dawgs, how we let the money get between us?
How we let these bitches get between us?
How we let these niggas get between us?
I got love for all my savages with itchy fingers
I got love but it ain't like the love I got for India
She held me down when I was broke, I got her to infinity
My lil' dawg caught a murder, gone for infinity
Dumping ashes on your obituary, I know you feeling me
R.I.P. my granddad Quick, he should have seen this shit
Twenty thousand on some child support, I seen this shit
Riding around with all them choppers, I done seen this shit
These rappers mad at me, but these niggas ain't doing shit
And I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit
I went and spent a half a ticket at the dealership
The fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships
If Esco didn't love me, would've been done jumped ship
And it's the love from my fans got me still here
You might also like[Interlude]
Monster, ah
Say I'm Illuminati
They tryna make me catch a body

[Verse 2]
I don't know when I'ma flip, nigga
Get me some codeine and sip, nigga
Big Bank saying wipe a nigga's nose
My girl changed the lock on the doors
Said fuck that shit, poured up a four
Ain't falling in love with no ho
That what you want for me?
That what you really expect?
You thinking I'm sitting up depressed?
I'm somewhere countin' up me a check
I hate I had to fuck with any of you niggas, that's my only regret
Drag the mink on the floor
Put Cuban links on my ho
Ten whips in a row, who would think we were poor?
Who would think we was poor?
There's money laying on the floor
Got some hoes laying on some hoes
Got lil' shawty with me, she a pro
Know she'll never meet another nigga, not another nigga like me
Even if he got a billion dollars, he can't make her cum like me
Who compliment you like me? It better be about an image
Tell me all of this a gimmick, they thought the whips got rented
Because the Spur wasn't tinted, I told 'em ain't got nothing to hide
Told 'em I'm through with the pies
Told 'em fuck all of my wrongs, I don't even write
My savages, my savages, my savages
We gon' leave a nigga stiffer than a mannequin
[Outro]
Free all my niggas incarcerated, you heard me?
Loyal for life, you heard?

Lyrics:

[Intro]
You know how we be rocking, ya heard

[Verse 1]
Bright light shining all bright on the Bentley
Work the Cadillac, panoramic, no panties
Old school Chevy '55 granddaddy
Gotta throw some salt on it, 'cause you know I'm getting at it
Throw the fork on it, then put it in traffic
Throw the sauce on it, got it flying out of Dallas
Hope you didn't do it to yourself, that's tragic
Hope you didn't throw away what we established
Hope you wouldn't turn your back on your family
The way a nigga look 'round here, they'll back stab you
Word from your motherfuckin' brother, young nigga
I just wanna see you happy, I just wanna see you happy
Comin' through the cut, like a known Grim Reaper
'Bout to get it straight finessed, tryna get a little cheaper
Hold on to that clip, like a doped up needle
Girl hang on that strip with a four Desert Eagle

[Chorus]
Known to put a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
Ayy, where ya mans at? Heard that the feds got 'em
I seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side
Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
It's a full moon in the middle of the day
Got them wolves out, rock a little Cartier
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Know a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday
Tell them young niggas grind 'fore you gon' knock someone down, if they gon' shoot, then shoot something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'
Man down over yonder, young came through holdin' on the cane like a drummer
They done took a boss out, nigga, no wonder
Niggas gettin' crossed out, nigga, no wonder
Hoes gettin' X'd out and we on ganja
The police wanna talk, but we won't say nothin'
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'
Niggas true to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'

Told the young nigga, "Freebandz, Roc-A-Fella"
Told a young nigga, "Freebandz, Roc-A-Fella"
You can turn this off and I can kick it acapella
We work the Front Street, where Mama said, "Don't go," we went there
Trap house embalmed with that crack, then we went there
Shawty don't fuck with these folks, these niggas be tellin' these days, be tellin' these days

ABK gon' walk a nigga down, straightjackеt

If another body drop, the feds might just snatch me
Man down, I'ma be overseas when it happen
Word around town, got them Ps in the attic
I'm applyin' pressure in the field, John Madden

Servin' niggas like Doughbeezy in my house shoes

[Verse 1]
Treat me like I'm Al Capone, nigga, fuck you
John Gotti, Illuminati, nigga, fuck you
I put a middle finger up, because, fuck you
This money got me geekin' up, nigga, fuck you
Red bottoms with the fur like Frank Luc
I bought some VVS and she caught the chain flu
I fucked this R&B bitch, I should thank you
Yah, I was sippin' my codeine from the beginnin'
She jocked my whole team, she seen who's winnin'
We light Liv up on a Sunday, come see us livin'
This for my dogs on the one way in penitentiaries
Send a direct hit, you gotta pay attention
I just lit my wrist up, I need some more attention
She didn't wanna play fair, I put her on suspension
I put a ki on Greyhound now I'm in a new dimension
Offered her 25, keep tryin' to take some of my percentage
I was petrified, you know my right wrist authentic
I get glorified, that Richard Mille cost 250
I'm a big dog, it ain't no sense in holdin' back
On my Usain Bolt shit, I ran up in yo' set
Fuckin' with them strippers all in G5ive
And as soon as the club closed we board the G5
I got scammers and junkies lined up on each side
I got five percent tint on each side
I tried to make it outta school on the East Side
I'm on my Nicky Barnes shit, so it's fuck school
I'm blowin' money real fast like Big Meech crew
I like my hundreds stacked up, I like ‘em neat too
They come in stuck together when they in the wrap still
I fucked a rapper bitch, I was on a drug deal
I fucked a rapper bitch, I was on a drug deal

Them bricks coming in like the John Doe crew
They put a number on your head, they tryna stank you
I'm ‘bout to take ‘em out the game, nigga fuck you
They got me goin' insane, now it's fuck you
I let my brother fuck your bitch, he got the dog food
I damn near get half a ticket for a walk through

Ayy gimme pounds, gimme bricks, I'm a nuisance

Lyrics:

[Intro]
I will never stop, never stop
Keep goin', keep goin'
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse]
I make Yeezy Boost moves in my Reeboks
It ain't gon' never stop
Tryna run a billion up until my ankle pop, yeah
You'll get rich and have problems that you never thought
It bring tears knowin' we came up out the sandbox
(Bringin' tears to my eyes)
Made it out the trenches, it got harder for my niggas
I just wanna see my dawgs ball, seven figures
I done got rich and it cursed me
Ever since I got successful, they envy
Tryna shake the devil, on promethazine
Tryna show you love but you don't feel me
Gave up on me so you turned your back
I can see the demons 'cause a nigga been blessed
I can tell you worried, but a nigga been in debt
I can't get caught up inside the matter
I should've did better, but it's chatter
I ran up my money off the gravel
Love is just a word, it don't matter to me
I got so rich, nothing matters to me
I'm livin' my second life, it's so amazin'
I done been hit with a bullet, and one grazed me
I done been considered a failure, it don't faze me
I done came up out the ghetto, my crib gated
Same niggas played with the devil, these niggas hatin'
All these bitches fuck with no rubbers, this shit brazy
Icy-ed out the Hublot, these niggas lookin' fugazi (Yeah)
Money stack tall past the ceilin', I can't be jaded
I done came from sleepin' on floors, you can't persuade me (Yeah)
I been takin' other niggas' hoes, it's gettin' outrageous (True story)
Rich nigga gettin' caught with a bitch worth minimum wages (Pluto)
Fuckin' with my ego, but I never lost a lady (Facts)
Fucked a pop star after I got my dreads braided
Never dropped her name but her head game contagious (No cap)
Twenty percent of my dames, I shipped 'em right out to Vegas (Gone)
You can feel the pain when I'm rappin' 'cause I'm ragin' (Wizard)
You can see my past and where I was on they faces (Weak)
I done flipped the truck over and crashed, ducked the agents (Facts)
I been with these blue hundreds like a nigga racist (Freebandz)
I been gettin' richer each year, feel like I'm racin' (Gone)
Tried to tell you the formula but you wouldn't take it
Hard work and perseverance, they ain't related (Ain't related)
Poppin' up on Forbes is fuckin' up my relations (Fuckin' up my family)
Ten milli' plus on a crib and it's vacant (Woo)
I can see it vividly at the crib, Rico basement  (Woo)
Watch him get the mula, I was sittin' back bein' patient (I was bein' patient)
I was sittin' back, programmin' my brain, I was in trainin' (Yeah)
I be in my coupe, Maybach, and I ain't have to trade it (Skrrt-skrrt)
Thinkin' 'bout when I was posted up when they raided (Swear I was)
Now I Double R and Ghost it up, I feel spacious (Woo)
I don't feel the safest, but I feel gracious (Yeah)
I thank God every day, I don't feel basic
Probably lose my sanity if I ain't have my babies (Sheesh)
Probably be gamblin' with my life if I ain't made it
Home invasions, and you ain't have to persuade me (Nah)
Cut it with a razor and serve it 'til your day
Came from whippin' out the bowl, Tom Ford suit and tie (Yeah)
Get my grandma to serve my dope, that ain't a lie (On God)
You can tell I've been broke when you look into my eyes (Future)
Nobody done noticed 'til the jet was in the sky
You might also like[Outro]
(Soaring, soaring)
Bringin' tears to my eyes (Oh yeah)
Nobody done noticed 'til the jet was in the sky
Bringin' tears to my eyes (Keep goin')
Gotta tell The WIZRD, it's a story like a book
Tears in my eyes
I can't forget where I came from
I lost a lover, it's alright
It can't be worse when I lost my main homie to the streets
You should've never give up on me without hearin' my side of the story
(The WIZRD)
I can't forget where I came from

Bringin' tears to my eyes19Embed

[Chorus]
I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base (Uh, uh), I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base (Yeah)
[Verse 1]
You would fuck a rich nigga for the fame, won't you?
You would give that pussy up to a lame, won't you?
Like an old school, I re-did the frame on you
I got my old shooters with me and they land on you
Word to them niggas out the six
A whole lotta lean my nutrition
They should've told ya I had the drank on me
They should've told ya I brung a bank with me
They should've told ya I keep that molly on me
They should've told ya I got that stick with me
You the one who duckin' from a drive-by
My niggas unemployed sellin' Popeyes

[Chorus]
I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base

[Verse 2]
I keep a shooter with me like Malone
I fucked around and did it on my own
Come and fuck with me, baby, I'm a franchise
Molly and them Xans got me aggravated
Them hundreds and them fifties, got 'em separated
Put them hundreds with them hundreds, yeah, we segregated
They tried to take the soul out me
They tried to take my confidence and they know I'm cocky
Fuck another interview, I'm done with it
I don't give a fuck about lil' ho', I let young hit it
I play the games of the thrones with you
I can't change, I was God-given
Tried to make me a pop star and they made a monster
I'm posted with my niggas lettin' the champagne flow
A nigga was depressed now my mind back home
A product of the roaches in them ashtrays
I inhale the love on a bad day
Baptized inside purple Actavis

I'm full of so much chronic, need a detox

[Chorus]
I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base

[Verse 3]
They should've told you I was just a trap nigga
I'm in the white house shootin' craps niggas
I gave up on my conscience, gotta live with it
This remind me when I had nightmares
These bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
They should've told you I was just a trap, nigga
They should've told you I was gon' lap niggas
They should've told you I was overseas
Say his last words, he can't breathe
They sent the ghetto bird out to peep me
They finally did admit that I was cloned
Because I was ambitious, now I'm on
Five in the mornin' on the corner rollin' stones
I just brought the money, I'll count it on my own
Fuck
[Pre-Chorus]
They should've told you I was on a pill
They should've told you I was on a Lear
I served cocaine in some Reeboks
I'm full of so much chronic, need a detox

[Chorus]

I serve the base, I serve the base

You the one who duckin' from a drive-by

Lyrics:

[Intro]
G5 the flight, man, I'm way in the sky
She finna tell me "No way" and it's cap
Nigga, can't even see me, I'm way in the sky
G5 the flight, nigga way in the sky
G5 the flight, man, I'm way outta here

[Chorus]
G5 the flight, nigga, can't even see me
I'm way outta here, I'm too far in the sky
Hermès ashtray to dump my ashes
Bitch so pretty, look better than Cassie
Puffin' on zooties and she callin' me daddy
Walkin' on shit, turn it up and I gas it
Came out the gutter, it ain't nothin' for me to swag it
Secure the bag, got a bitch, I'ma bag it
Turnin' it up, gotta make sure shit good
Park it, two mil' in the middle of my hood
Drinkin' on mud, I made it out of thе sewer
Chrome Hеart accessories, whatever, I'm good
Lot of these niggas, they lookin' the same
They copy my lingo, they bitin' my chain
Championship, championship, Range just gon' amp this shit
Bitch break her neck just to look at the kid

[Verse 1]
Dirty the Fanta but make it in Canada
Bro get this money like it's my religion
It's gon' be a mad day, a sad day for any of these niggas
That try to compare whatever I did
Damn near touched a hundred, it just off the gig
I came out the jungle, they kidnapped a kid
I trap out a bando, spent ten on a crib
I look at the ocean to spot thirty M's
Pin it where I'm at, the city I'm in
I give you my fully, no matter where I'm in
Her hair touch her ass, she gon' think she Korean
You fuckin' me good, bitch, you helpin' me win
Niggas can't see me, ain't no competition
Too many bracelets, need a whole 'nother wrist
I'm never sober, don't think I'ma quit
I pop the E, I can feel when it kick

They copy my lingo, they bitin' my chain
Championship, championship, Range just gon' amp this shit
Bitch break her neck just to look at the kid

[Verse 2]
Count up some millions then take some more drugs
Been stuck in my memory, they wasn't showing love
Ain't matching my fly, bitch, you know you a dub
I started this wave and ain't using a brush
Stopped taking molly, I'm back on the E
Flying commercial, you ain't high as me
Driving a spaceship, the one with the wings
Cross up the trap, I done broke down a key
Ain't let no fuck nigga holdin' me back
Put a switch on it, these lil' niggas whack
After I hit your bitch, givin' her back
Ain't got no roof, put her heart on a strap
Go to the moon, ain't gon' show you no slatt
Pluto tycoon, ain't no regular 'Cat
Took a few shrooms, I forget where I'm at
Poppin' a Tesla, I feel when it kick
[Chorus]
G5 the flight, nigga, can't even see me
I'm way outta here, I'm too far in the sky
Hermès ashtray to dump my ashes
Bitch so pretty, look better than Cassie

Took niggas out the hood like I'm from there
So you know it's all good when I come there
I hear you talk about your city like you run that
And I brought my tour to your city, you my son there, nigga
But I had to come through for the remix
On my haven’t-done-a-verse-in-eight-weeks shit
And if a nigga say my name, he the hot shit
But if I say the nigga name, he still the hot shit
Fucked up, lucky I don't feed into the gossip
Niggas act like they don't know, but they should know
Yeah, I just think it's funny how they dangling the bait
But I'm the one that's killing niggas on the hooks, though
And niggas ain't got a grill, still ice-grill hating
I know y'all already know Mike Will Made It
Just looking at the numbers, nigga, I feel amazing
I'll call Michael Jordan up and Mike will make it
I'm the young rap nigga with the 'Melo deal
You need to come to OVO for a better deal
Just know a million ain't shit once you get a mil'
And niggas say it’s all good
That’s how you better feel, nigga, nah!
Fuck that, this year I'm talking big stuff
Rolling through the city like a young nigga bricked up
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That's why we never gave a fuck
When a fuck nigga switched up, damn!

[Intro]
It's a light day
Ain't got on nothin' but about 700 thousand worth
That's it
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
I was havin' trust issues
But I've been havin' way better luck since you
I know it's true love with you
Told myself I don't wanna fall in love with you
Rollin' on the 'eeway speedin'
Friday, just started the weekend
XO textin', you respondin'
We gon' go crazy with this money
We do hot yoga, 92 degrees
Can you stretch it out? Stretch it out for me
I got somewhere to be, but it's hard to leave
When you do it like you mean it, I'm proceedin'
Is you the one? Is you the one?
Then she looked me in my eyes
Told me, "Fuck them pussy niggas, they ain't ridin' 'cause I'm ridin' and I'm dyin' for you, baby"
Got me feelin'

Girl, take it all off 'cause I know you active
Did you come to talk or is you 'bout that action?
Diamonds on my neck, moonwalkin', Michael Jackson
I'ma have your body sweatin' like you dipped in baby oil
I'ma do whatever it's gon' take to keep my baby spoiled
I'ma do whatever it's gon' take to shake these haters off
Put it on, fuck the cost

Title: Inside the Mattress
Release Date: January 17, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Future-inside-the-mattress-lyrics
Song Description: Sunday morning taking in the new Future tape, a few favorites have been tossed around on Twitter. Inside The Mattress seems to have the greatest consensus, and happens to be the only on the track produced by long-time Future collaborators Nard & B. The duo has worked on classics from Straight Up to Throw Away, making them one of Fewtchs best matches, but also one of his most underrated.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I pour out yellow tuss, I pour out yellow tuss
Cause I gotta have it
Yeah, Hendrix
I pour out yellow tuss, I pour out yellow tuss
Cause I gotta have it

[Chorus]
Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Ganks hid inside the mattress
Vert' dippin' through traffic
I'm gettin' better, I'm at practice
I'm workin' everyday, craftin'
I'm cool on her, I done had her
Bounce back with a millio'
Hit an island like Gilligan
Not just a regular civilian
I ride for the squad, I'm a champion
Remember we hit up the highway, we got us a stash spot
Remember as soon as we touch down, nigga cash out

[Verse 1]
I get on the stage and I rap 'til I pass out
Hit another city and another city, I'm just groovin'
I was tryna tell you I was losin'
I was gon' tell you I'm improvin'
I done caught a vibe, she was choosin'
Gotta keep my pride, I'm a general
Gotta keep it real with some criminals
Gotta keep my focus, I'm phenomenal
Once I cock and load I'm the money man
Got a hundred hoes, got a hundred Xans
We gon' party hard till the moon calls
She done fell in love with the mushrooms
And my college girls talkin' kung-fu
Put some cough syrup in a Mountain Dew
You would never see what I go through
Gotta keep my pride, I'm a general
Gotta keep it real with some criminals
Gotta take my time with these bad bitches
I don't wine and dine with no bad bitches
Send a flight for a bad bitch
Over night for a bad bitch
Cartier on a bad bitch
Cartier on a bad bitch

[Verse 2]
I never told the world about you
I never told the homies 'bout you, not once
I never had no bitter towards you
I never had no drama for you, not once
I never want to go to none of these award shows
That's not me
Only the time will tell the day I prevail and get me a Grammy
Lil Mexico, kept it real from the start
If I did it for you it came from the heart
Came from the trenches and turned into art
I wake up and do it way better tomorrow
I wake up and cook up a kilo
Take a flight on a jet out to Rio
It's mafia all day
We come out the hallways
Murder in broad day, murder in broad day
Sit in the passenger side with the tool on my lap
Got lawyers and actresses and models pursuin' me now
Our foundation built on loyalty, you can't ruin me now

[Intro: Future]

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Solitary diamonds, solitary jewels

Bustin' out my back room, she ain't out the loop
It's jumpin', let it in (Ooh)
I put it out, they come in (Ooh)

[Verse 1: Future & Travis Scott]
Came up off a brick
Bought a Richard Mille, my new watch don't tick
Drippin' in Louis V, made a movie, and Prada another film
It's the Don Dada, I stand this Lamborghini on one wheel
Twelve o'clock, and I got my gun clocked, and I'm on one pill
Monday all the way to Sunday, pick a time to drill
Gettin' my lettuce, I'm gettin' my paper, I'm gettin' my trees (Woo, woo)
One thousand percent, keep it one thousand with me (Woo, woo, yeah)
Started with my squad, so I can't chill
Money over bitches, gotta play the field
Coronavirus diamonds, you can catch the flu
Trap in bandos, walk in Jimmy Choo
Solitaries made a rockstar too (Ooh)
Solitary diamonds, I can show proof (Ooh)
That these bitches on me just like a pop group
I got racks on my mind and I can't lose (Yeah)
And I got solitary diamonds, solitary jewels
Watches full of baguettes, pockets full of blue (Yeah)
Solitary diamonds, solitary jewels
Girls gettin' naked in my swimming pool (Yeah)
I wanna take care you and your friends (Yeah)

Ooh

All the dogs is hungry and they sellin' food (Yeah)
Every time we do it, tend to hit the news
I don't want it if it's stiff or if that pussy loose
Runnin', know they gunnin' 'cause I got the juice
I been thuggin' since a youngin, brought that work to school
Floodin' all the hundreds, we done broke the pool
All this money bring the power, I didn't make the rules (Let's go)

[Verse 2: Future & Travis Scott]
Sipping on codeine got my screws loose
Making all this money got my screws loose (Yeah)
Ridin' Lamborgini made her pussy juicy
Grippin' on the wheel, playin' in her pussy
Diamonds on my neck been going crazy
I think I need to see a psychiatrist (Ooh)
Living in the streets and the gutter raised me
I know how to sell narcotics (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
When they let us off of lock', man, we gon' make that shit pop
Been humpin' wifey for so long, she got a limp when she walk
Got seven drops in four spots, I get to pick where I live
In the back they playin' twinsies like a Hugh Hefner zoo
On my teeth, these diamonds twinkle, in her legs a jacuzzi
I be tweakin' every day, I got some screws missin'
I keep an Air Max pump on me, no, not my 270s (Yeah)
And they know just where I be, it's like I'm 713 (Yeah)
Havin' money on this side is not the conversation (Yeah, yeah)
Solitary diamonds for my dawg inside, he waited, yeah (Straight up)
[Chorus: Travis Scott & Future]
Solitary diamonds, solitary jewels
With a bitch that's shinin', lookin' like the moon
Said she wanna party, wanna let it loose
Bustin' out my back room, she ain't out to loop
I wanna take care you and your friends (Ooh)
I put it out, they come in (Ooh)

Title: Use Me
Release Date: February 24, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Future-use-me-lyrics
Song Description: Future expresses his feelings during this emotional song about a girl that has been used by other men.

You know that niggas is full of tries, oh, oh
Just so you know, I need you to know how to use me
Tell me what youre usin' me for

Future likes the girl but wonders if she only wants to be with him because of his wealthy lifestyle. However if shes truthful with him, hes willing to help her elevate herself.

The song was produced by Detail (Beyoncs Drunk In Love) with Miami production trio The Track Burnaz, who comprise Ruben, JB, and Briggs. Just a month before HNDRXX was released, The Track Burnaz landed their first major placement as co-producers on Big Seans Inspire Me.
Track Burnaz recalled the story of the beat to Genius:

JB: When we were doing the beat, Ruben was just playing some chords. We were just going for a real summertime vibe.

Ruben: That day, I was just going through chord changes and I found this really cool drum patch on Fruity Loops. I was really digging it, and I felt like it needed something a little more percussive so I added keys to it. I remember thinking, Man, it sounds nice, but it sounds too much like a ballad. I wasnt in love with it. Then I found a cool guitar patch and I started playing the same changes over that with the guitar patch, and thats when JB jumped right in.

Detail had asked the trio to send him some beats without disclosing who it was for. Ruben recalled: After we created it, we sent it to Detail to add some production or write to it, whatever he wanted to do. Detail kinda hinted that there were big things in the works but he never said exactly what it was and then it became the Future record.
Lyrics:

[Intro]

I'll grab your whip and take it back to Chi-Town
When I'm in Chi-Town, I treat it like it's my town

From this point on you don't have to deal with your past

[Verse 2]
Thousand karats on my hand, 'bout to get xanned out
I can always lean on these bands when niggas was down and out
I got an AK on my shoulder, my trigger finger hot
I feel like Pink Floyd with the lean out
I feel like Pretty Boy, Money Team out
Kissin' on the water with my chains out
My life is more effective than a cocaine drought
Cause I was trappin' at Grandma's house when I came out
I said "Fuck the streets" and made my own lane now
When you get high enough, you can dodge raindrops
But tell your momma and your daddy you in a gang now
[Chorus]
You know that niggas full of lies
Oh, oh
You know that niggas full of tries

You know that niggas full of lies

Oh, yeah you can use me
Use me, then use me
Then you better, then you better

Lyrics:

[Intro]

(Wheezy outta here)

[Verse 1]
Sitting behind five percent, you can see the chinain
Lil' one going crazy, ready to sprrt for the ginang
If it wasn’t for Google, man that bitch wouldn't know my nickname
Dropped a Maybach truck on a watch and it was plain jane
Let the door swang, swang the door open, smell cocaine
Trafficking drug money and trap out this one lane
Stepped all in mud, this bitch can't wait to tie my shoelace
Oh, she don’t like girls, bet this money make a bitch so gay

[Chorus]
Money real long, big as King Kong when you make the trap go jump
Yellow wrist stones, canary yellow stones, I'm putting on that stuff
Digging in hеr back, pull out my money, make a bitch bust a nut
Came out thе bando just to buy diapers, had to hit me a lick
I bought the Tahoe from the trap money, haven't even seen a brick
Cocaine by the kilo, these days put it right on my wrist
You can still see the chain lit up sitting behind five percent

[Verse 2]
Every time I re-up, they gotta advance at least twenty M
I been getting richer and richer my whole career
Took the dope money, went and record a mixtape, it's rappers way out
Sitting on a bail toting a big K, ain't even got a couch
To Australia, I'm familiar, spent two million on a jet
In that dualie doing the dash, I let lil' dawg he hold a TEC
I got molly with the crystals, but I been back doing X
Got a Rolex on my wrist, this bitch cost 'bout a Corvette
Give these niggas a couple bands and hit your face and hit your chest
I was rolling off the pill, I should’ve never fucked the bitch
I got hoes these niggas married, I don’t let 'em go, they come through
I got fentanyl in my diamonds, I spend a nine on a pair of shoes
I don’t even care who these niggas shot at, ain't nan of 'em got murked
I got some real killers, they'll kill a nigga, then go and shoot up the hearse
You think a nigga like me give a fuck ’bout a nigga shooting up the church?
I gotta take this shit up with God 'cause I'm a god on the earth
I got this motherfuckin' new Benz, I ain't even drove it since it came out
Couple of bad bitches, they twins, walkin' naked through my house
Cook good dope up in the kitchen, I could do that top chef
Bitches still claiming me, I ain't fucked in over a year
You might also like[Chorus]

Came out the bando just to buy diapers, had to hit me a lick
I bought the Tahoe from the trap money, haven't even seen a brick

You can still see the chain lit up sitting behind five percent

[Outro]
Sitting behind five percent, you can see the chinain

[Verse 1]
Twenty-eight grams, I serve it on the porch
I just seent them narcs, they ran off in my house
The homicide unit comin' to the house
My cousin murked a nigga and he just got out
I hang with all the killers and the robbers
I pour me up some drank, say "Fuck my problems"
My hood, they treat me, like I'm El Chapo
I keep that dog food, like I'm Ralo
I had the warrant in Clayco and beat the case
Man, I'm fresh as hell, bitch, Easter day
All my ghetto tactics, I'm above average
I've been so in tune, man, I've been so ambitious
Grab another Fanta, let me fill it up
If they ain't make the channel, you ain't built like us
The Federales fuckin' with my nigga Ty

I can go from car to car, these bitches quarter million at least
Two thousand for the shoes, I keep some shit on my feet

Send a junkie, send a driver just to get somethin' to eat
You see how things change?
I came from cocaine

Title: Slave Master
Release Date: July 17, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Future-slave-master-lyrics
Song Description: Slave Master plays off the use of the word whip the songs hook. Cars are often referred to as whips in hip-hop, and Future claims he has a new whip like Im a slave master, since slave masters would use the weapon on slaves.

The play on words is very clever, and seems to be a tongue and cheek reference to the racial tension building in America, since Future also references Eric Garners last words in the track I Serve the Base.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]

I’m gone off these medicals, gone off these medicals

And maybe one day we can fuck in the bank
I made me a Porsche out of two and a quarter
I got to Morocco and lay in some foreigns
Then I come back to Onyx and find me that one I can fuck on
And touch on and turn up and turn on
We don’t watch TV, we count Fettuccine
4 and a half, it’s right under my beanie
I made me some snaps then I fucked on a genie
Put her in a cab and I jumped in a 'Ghini
You gon’ need yellow tape when I step on the scene
When you send me an invite, I come with a biznite
She wrapped up in plastic, got coke in the mattress
All of this shit is about living lavish
This money, these cars, and these bitches, these carats
These radical styles, I’ma give you a style
You can take it, your new style ain't gon' make you a pile

Light skinned bone the same color macaroni
Put her hair in a pony, hit a note like Toni
I know you hoes been lonely, now I’m back on my lonely
And I'm back how you want it, and I'm back and I want it
Made a film like Sony, fuck the fake and the phony

I be staying at the telly, eat a sandwich out the deli
And my life is like Belly, young Future, sincerely

[Produced by Ludwig Göransson & Metro Boomin]

[Intro]
I was so hardheaded at first
My grandma didn't even believe in me
I kept goin' though
All I can say is I told you
Jewelry at the bank now in the vault
You should've never doubted me
I'ma work 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah you should've never doubted me
The pain and the struggle followed me
My daddy never been there, bothered me
And these cold streets made a man of me
Know a time, it'll come, they doubt me
Had to keep them OGs 'round me
Keep a young, young homie grounded
You never know where your motivation'll come from
We do the most for these broads and pop Chandon
They try to push you aside, you gotta fight some
I had it on the dot and now we ride guns
I want that number one spot, I'm like icon
I got that beast in my eyes, I'm like Tyson
With my heart and my drive, I know I'm righteous
Keep some ice on me, Rocky, Rocky like Balboa
Once you win, win, win you gon' want more
Set a trend, trend, trend, need an encore
I was down on my last when I found myself
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath

[Verse 2]
I came from them quarter waters
Every nigga in my gang unemployed
You fuckin' 'round, you must want a gang war
I got ol' girl, then I transport her
Trappin' is a habit, I got Xans on me
I'm hotter than a flame, keep the fan on me
Catch me whippin', I'm Hussein with them bands on me
I'ma kill the competition and I'm playin' for keeps
You see water drippin' off me then catch it
I turned nothin' into somethin', now I'm livin'
You neglected me, you know you shouldn't have did that
They was countin' me out, you know you shouldn't have did that
You didn't recognize my drive, shouldn't have did that
Now I'm flyin' every day, I won't get back
I just wanna be the champ for the misfits
And the ones that would say I couldn't do it
[Hook]

[Bridge]
Who knew I would take it to a whole 'nother level
Who knew I've been racin' with a whole 'nother rebel
Shawty wasn't checkin' for me, mama wasn't checkin' for me
I hustle every day just so I can spend a check on you
You my dawg 'til the end, I got so much respect for you
I watched you give up on me, but I never lost faith, did I?
You didn't ever hold me down, then I bought a new safe, didn't I?
Paper plates flushin' in that Wraith, didn't I?
I'm built with a new reputation
Blood, sweat and tears are my new foundation
Obama on my main line, I could run the nation

[Hook]
I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath

Lyrics:

[Interlude]
Was there to see all of the real raw shit, but you ain't stay
Well, I got— kept it all to myself, you know what I mean? Haha
It's understandable
You know exactly who a motherfucker is, dawg
You know what I'm saying?
You know exactly who a motherfucker is
You could've been right here with a motherfucker, but you ain't wanna be right here with a motherfucker
How the fuck you gon' look at me now and try to holler at me like we motherfuckin' friends?
You know we ain't no motherfuckin' friends

Shawty, ride with me

[Chorus]
Lord, forgive me, I've been on a rampage
Grim Reaper ridin' in the Rolls Royce, yeah, yeah
Spent a day to sober up, then I popped me one up
I can't pop up when I want with her, she popular
I've been tryna fight my demons, I've been tryna fight my cup
I always tell her she my therapy, I told her it was rough
She acceptin' all my flaws, I got diamonds with the cut
I've been sufferin' withdrawals, missin' out on real love

Different, you a angel, true to me
They gon' try to convince me that it's different
But I know, it's in my spirit and I can feel it, yeah
She don't bring up when these bitches bein' miserable and typical
Take my blood, baby, we goin' digital
Thousand dollar ski boots by Perry Ellis
And I don't plan on taking no ski trip, they ain't even drip (Woo)
Chanel fanny pack out in Egypt, ain't no reason
Gucci bucket hat for all my heathens
Temporary distractions, ain't no grievin' 'cause they reachin'
Copy and they clone what I'm feedin', they be thievin'
China white in my home, be strategic, I got Fiji
Grind up on my own 'cause I see how they mistreat me
Don't you let 'em turn you on me, I see it, I can peep it
Clear like white Patron, I can see it, you conceited
Talkin' on the phone, you can hear my tone, mischievous
Plastic or the chrome, whatever we need to keep us heated
Canary yellow stone, girl, shine on my demons
I feel it in my bones when you takin' out my semen
I purchased a couple Cashmere sweaters this evening
Take you for a walk in the park like a deacon
Half a ticket, pullin' up on you and mamacita
Give you the keys in her face to show her how I treat you
I'm takin' you out on dinner dates, got Franklins like Aretha
Trained in the warzone, codeine in my one liter
Pain in my attitude, it's vicious and it's lethal
Came off the avenue and ran into a diva
Broken-hearted, baby had me down, had to get you
You out the garden, baby, I'm from the jungle with the leeches
Clouded my lungs up and I slowly started speakin'
Rain, thunderin', showin' you grace for this meetin'
Givin' you compliments throughout the day and the weekend
Fall in love with revenge, hopin' that'll kill my demons
Sittin' out on my porch, I'm in disbelief
Give me glory, give me Lori, that's victory
Moment I drop your name, is it chemistry?
Fuck this money and fame if it's meant to be
Like a rock star showin' up at a symphony
Rock hard, pissin' on my enemy
Fuck 'em all, we don't show 'em sympathy
Her favorite color blue, I bought her Tiffany
Out the trap spot, I got my dope degree
They persuaded me, they gon' try to persuade you to leave
Had laid in it, played in it, and stayed in it for weeks
Mistakes like earthquakes, they can't break us a piece
I'm not Catholic but had to have a talk with the priest
Acrobatic flips, gettin' European cash 'cross the sea
It's so radical, automatic-al, I'm knowin' we elite
Fascinated by the lifestyle, you know it bring greed
Fascinated by your feistiness, okay
Fascinated over your crisis, it's warfare
When we roll one, we converse, we like orphans
Coast to coast, float the ocean like a starfish
Check my post, I'ma toast to the heartless
That's why I'm prayin' for better days on this continent
I don't need a ghost to write my promises
You boost my confidence
[Chorus]
Lord, forgive me, I've been on a rampage
Grim Reaper ridin' in the Rolls Royce, yeah, yeah
Spent a day to sober up, then I popped me one up
I can't pop up when I want with her, she popular
I've been tryna fight my demons, I've been tryna fight my cup
I always tell her she my therapy, I told her it was rough
She acceptin' all my flaws, I got diamonds with the cut
I've been sufferin' withdrawals, missin' out on real love8Embed

Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

[Verse 1: Future]
I take over the streets, fresh off the banana boat
I come straight from the east, where niggas split your cantaloupe
You tell me where you wanna meet, I'm comin' with a gang of dope
My cigar full of loud, I'm laced up to the fuckin' fo'
A Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911
I do the whole dash, droppin' all cash (Woah)
Gutter to the death of me, I'm stickin' to the recipe
Plugged in with Colombians, I know Sosa
All I got is my balls and my word, fuck the roaches
Everything we do, we put Versace on the sofas
The money got me geeked like I took a hit of coca
My life is a movie, I gotta stay focused

On the hood you see the Stallion, passenger a stallion
Niggas gettin' nervous, I'm passin' out the Valium
I suggest you pop it, but please don't get too sleepy
Used to have them bitches twerkin' up in 400 West Peachtree
Bet you those same hoes'll see me, be like that's how you feelin'?
Used to stay up at The Twelve, now you're worth like 12 million
Boy, you did it, boy, you did it, you did the unexpected
I say fuck the unexpected, I just did what I projected
I swear young women are lost these days while older women dig me
Fuckin' women that knew Biggie, so it really ain't no biggie
It's just OVO and XO, and Freebandz the committee
And shout out to Toronto, bitch, I'm Tony in my city, huh

When you're plugged in with Pedro, it's hard for hoes to let go
See AK's ain't no bitch, nigga, I'll split your tato
Ain't nothin' about me ordinary, I come with the yayo
I move like a mob boss, it's gon' take an army
The world is mine, nigga, you get it if you want it
You fuckin' with me, you'll move to Alaska by the mornin'
You want me to be the bad guy? Okay, it's on then
Champagne spillin', crab cakes everywhere
My white bitch trippin', she say I ain't playin' fair
I'm about to cop a tiger, and put it in the car seat
Freebandz a company, so, nigga, it don't matter, ayy14Embed

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Comin' from the 'Raq, the home of the drillers
I'ma buy a home next to your home if I miss you
Rubbin' on your ass, but your mouth is the issue
When you run for '24, I bet your spouse gon' be with you
Who put this together? Me, that's who
"We did it, Joe," but what they really do?
Save the pep talk, and the TED Talk (Ye)
I'm 'bout to set it off (Ye), I'm 'bout to set it off (Ye)
Somebody said he off (Ye), well, let me get this off (Ye)
Visionary thoughts (Ye) 'fore I could barely talk (Ye)
Mind runnin' laps (Ye) 'fore I could barely walk (Ye)
They say we never make it (Ye), that's what you thought (Ye)

[Verse 2: Future]
Cookin' out the bowl, tryna scrape out the paint
One day I was high, had to pour the whole pint
Woke up in the sky, same money from the bank
I'll take it wrapped in plastic, accept anything
Cut up the dark with the fetti, nine times
Doped up today like I got ninety-nine lives
Blood on my money, see the blood in my eyes
LaFerrari, buy them, two at a time
Every time I fuck, you gotta tell me it's mine
Sinnin' again, I've been winnin' again
Tray done got shot, he back spinnin' again
Ridin' with the fire, bitch ain't never gon' see
Walkin' in the day one in the head is a must
Dark in my flesh, say it run in my cup
Rose gold like a Band-Aid over my cut
Tailored in plush and covered up all this kush
[Bridge: Kanye West]
Cross me so much, I got nails in my hand
City on fire, like Bethlehem

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Testin' my faith and I fell in a trance
Blessings on blessings, they fell in my hand
Comin' from the 'Raq, we the home of the drillers
Comin' from the hundreds, you got change for a billion?
Comin' for the house, real change in a minute
When I run for '24, I know my spouse better be with me
Hundred feet tall when I stand on the business
Look at how we did everything we intended
You don't want no tension, boy, you just want attention
I'ma pop up at your house if you pop up in my mentions

[Verse 4: Future]
Got a bando, count money with a MAC
Seen too much violence, done seen too much death
Bodies on bodies, got a gang full of them
Raised by gangsters, prostitutes and pimps
Visit my grandmother in prison on Sunday
Talk in third person, they won't admit it if I done it
Money like sage in my house, keep it burnin'
Money like sage in my house, keep it burnin'
[Outro: Kanye West & Future]
City on fire
Money like sage in my house, keep it burnin'
City on fire
Money like sage in my house, keep it burnin'

[Intro: Future & Travis Scott]
Back on the Forbes, shit crazy (Yeah)

I'm a street nigga and I stay faded (Pluto, yeah)
Never worked in a gym, but I weighed it (Travis, yeah)

[Chorus: Future & Travis Scott]
First off, you get the ammo, then you cock it (Ooh)
First off, we had to blast off like a rocket (Skrrt, skrrt)
I put the Patek water on, but I got options (Yeah)
PJ takin' off and I ain't stoppin', no
Louis V belts, Louis V on my walls
Fishscale, nigga, I can't fuck with no laws (Yeah)
Linda Farrow's what's on my lens, I see fugazi
I should pimp this bitch and make her pay me (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Future & Travis Scott]
Started off surfin' on a codeine wave
I don't exchange info with these niggas
They some opps, you can kill 'em, they ain't with us
Ordered a pound of gas to smoke, I need a fill-up (Yeah)
Got a line on good Gelato and Gorilla
Got Lil Freaky with me, know you gon' get hit up
Steppin' over dead bodies in Margielas (Oh yeah)
I touched a hundred M's and I've been gettin' better (Ooh)
In a red Bugatti, gave it right to valet
Shoot his head off right, it get you new Chanaynay
Shootin' dice all night, yeah, me and Dae Dae
We had to work the one on 'em, it was a good payday
He was a teenager, they put him on the news where I'm from
He let off forty shots, he can't get no bond
Closed on when he shoppin', when he kill him, he young
They ever get caught snitchin', they gon' cut off your tongue (Mm)
I can't wait 'til they set the rat up, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I was catchin' juugs, now a nigga a millionaire
I get the rap check and I avoid the paps

Bound to cut off where it's dim and pour above the rim (Yeah)
Get the backend at the door and let the dogs kill 'em (Dogs)
Point 'em out, then turn around, that's how we let 'em in (Ooh)
Paranoid, one conversation, then I switch the SIM (Oh)
This took like NBA business, I ain't talkin' scrimmage (In the league)
You know I'm James Bond with it, Harden with the finish
New whip's got curtain options in it, I don't need it tinted (Yeah)

Used to spend checks on my Nikes, now they pay me (Yeah, yeah)

Title: How It Was
Release Date: December 17, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/Future-how-it-was-lyrics
Song Description: Future has a new track on GTA Vs radio station Radio Los Santos called How it Was.

And after only a few listens to the stomping, Auto-Tune drenched victory lap that is How It Was, it becomes readily apparent that Futures cartoonish excess and sing-rap warble is almost tailor made to soundtrack the numerous imagined felonies committed throughout the course of the game.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
This is an experience
If you haven't been a part of nothing this great
We went through motherfuckin', the unbelievable

[Chorus]
Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud
That's how it was
Last night we made a movie, I'ma tell you how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was

[Verse 1]
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it
I was self motivated, I was self driven
I got my determination, now I'm really winnin'
We could pull up Maseratis, I done whipped the Benzes
I was handin' thousands out when I go shop at Lenox
When it come to stackin' cash up, it ain't no limit
I got racks on top of racks and I ain't talking tennis
It's some girls that's gone wild, I like to see them kissin'
It's some niggas playing foul and they sneak dissin'
I won't let her hold me back to complete my mission
It ain't easy when you try to make it out the trenches

[Verse 2]
I'm the dope man, dope man, yes I am
Turned your baby mama house into a drug lab
I was using all the forks, using all the pans
She done seen a lot of money touch a nigga hands
Saw me microwaving dope, like some leftovers
Drugged in with the green grow, a lawn mower
I’m a Michael Fox, George Jetson, Elroyer
I'm a space cadet, an astronaut, a rockstar
I was trapped in the trap, dodging cop cars
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Jupiter, and Mars
You ain't foreign, it's okay, I like all broads
I'ma hustle everyday so I don't never starve
[Chorus]
Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud
That's how it was

How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was

[Verse 3]
Serve it to you cleaner than the house keeper
Cruisin' by the scene with a street sweeper
Pour a half a pint of codeine in a two liter
Scorchin' hot flame, all that Future drop is heaters
I put passion in my lyrics and I'm working, nigga
Got a dogfood connect; DMX, nigga
Got a styrofoam cup, and I'm doubled up
Think I'm Usain Bolt, ran my bands up
Ain't no pressure on my money, ‘cause I'm certified
All these diamonds 'round my neck, it got em mesmerized
All these drugs inside my system got me super high
Posted up and servin' junkies, been a long time
[Chorus]
Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud
That's how it was

I'm a motherfuckin' boss, I'm a motherfuckin' boss
I'm a motherfuckin' giant
I see how you watchin', I see how you lookin'
I see how you smile
I sit back and watch how the drama unfold while I'm on recline
I know the homies, my brothers, my cousins
They gon' ride for me
I know Tiarra, and Britney, and Keisha
They gon' lie for me
I got some people they know that I love 'em
But I ain't got time to see
I see in people the moves that I'm makin'
You know I'm playin' for keeps
You niggas ain't seein' me, never, you're never gon' see me

[Verse 1]
I got big racks, all in your face and you 'bout to get silent
Big 'Bach, fuck that little bitty car that you're drivin' (skrrt, skrrrt)
Big racks, anything I'm whippin' barely got mileage
Big racks, and you know that bitch that you're with, she mine
Yeah she my bitch, nigga
She wanna hit on me under the covers like lovers
Like we divine
She recognize that I'm so thorough
I'm one of them breeds, I'm all on her mind
She wanna look me eye to eye and tell me her lies
I had accepted you
Just like you came and never look down on you
Tell that lil' nigga to stay in his place before I expose you
You take one shot at me, you know that'll cause an explosion
Never fight the hand that feeds you, nigga
You gon' pay a nigga, yeah, to squeeze the trigger
You an itchy finger blog type of nigga
And you know me, nigga

Is it too late for a comeback
I had to live with this crown on my head
I don't got no regrets, I don't have no regrets
I got to live with this crown on my head
I got to talk to my homies up stairs
Sorry to tell you I gotta address it
Feeling this game and I'm learning my lesson
Accepting the hate when it's coming
I jumped out the Wraith on them bums
I tell you you're wrong when you're right
I'm never gon' judge, no I'm never gon' judge
You got a nigga, but I know you love me, baby

[Intro: Future]
This ain't a diss song, this a real song (DY Krazy)
Nigga, we ain't runnin' from no responsibilities
I take care of families
I'm embarrassed over this mess that I done caused

[Chorus: Future]
I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile

[Verse 1: Future]
Gotta keep it stashed up for the trial
Material intentions, gotta play it foul
I'm in rare form like a hyena runnin' wild
All the opps gettin' gunned down

[Chorus: Future]
I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry

I lost connections to the streets and I was in denial
I seen a grown man shed tears 'cause he lost his trial
I saved the streets, a crazy feeling just to lose a child
Have a one-on-one with God, yeah, it been a while
I woke up paranoid off drugs, I said, "I'm tired now"
I answer my phone in the middle of the night, like, "Who done died now?"
Knowin' I'm involved, but we gon' slide back when it's dyin' down
I don't know who opps no more, you look crazy, I'm firin' rounds
I love the streets, it's a portion of me
I came from nothin' to the voice of the streets
I got blood in the streets
The way he died, I advise he died in his sleep
That's the trenches, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Future]
I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'

[Verse 3: Future]
Public conversation got you touchin' clouds
Popped the wrong pill, hit the wrong dial
Ain't no visitation, waitin' for the trial (Ain't no visitation)
Took my last name, this ain't 'bout the child (Woah)
Real classy Jazzy, real don't do no trollin'
Gotta treat you like you dead when you playin' bogus
[Verse 4: Lil Durk]
See, Pluto, you my brother, gotta stay focused
Sometimes I get in my feelings, too, I wish I wore a Trojan
They tryna go viral off DMs, that's why I'm antisocial
I'm just tryna teach the killers not to use emotion
I got a whole bitch, don't think about my old bitch
I'm just tryna live my life and catch this moment, yeah

[Chorus: Future]
I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile

[Outro: Future]
We can't even get no sleep behind this shit
You make a temporary decision
That cause permanent pain
Shit ain't goin' nowhere (I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides)

Ain't no consciousness, I'm bout to spaz on this stallion
Fuck a casualty, everything we did was lavishly
Fuck a tragedy, all these sticks automatically

Song Description: In When I Was Broke, Future looks back, before his money and riches, and pay tributes to a girl who remained loyal despite his situation.

The track harks back to the romanticism of 2014s album Honest, and, along with Feds Did a Sweep, represents a transition to the smoother album HNDRXX.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, she ain't leave when I was broke
I used to sit at the trap all day and wait for a phone call
She ain't leave when I was broke
Juggin' and finessin'
She ain't leave when I was broke
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to climb out the sewer
Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'
Hold me down
Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it
Sometimes I try to be there for you
And my plan, it don't go like I want it
Watch me roll this dope, watch me
Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me

[Chorus]
She ain't leave when I was broke
She ain't leave when I was broke
(She ain't leave when I was broke)
One thing that she didn't do
She ain't leave when I was broke (she ain't leave)
Don't ever tell her what I go through
But how she act, I know she know
I can see you was givin' up
And that's what killed me the most

Came out the sewer, it's stankin'
Go in the booth and I'm blankin'
Slept with my tool on the blanket
Like I'm the son of Michael
All of these haters, they're gettin' spiteful
They see my heart has been damaged
You see the whip Panoramic
You see I made it, you witnessed progression
I was talkin' like I knew I was destined
I'm a boss and I won't ever regret it
Whether you like it, you gotta admit it
Didn't I change up your location?
Didn't I pull up in that Wraith?
Have I fulfilled all your dreams?
I gave you checks
So you're checkin' it off on your wish list
You get Ferraris right now
We doin' Cali right now (without a doubt)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to climb out the sewer
Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'
Hold me down
Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it
Sometimes I try to be there for you
And my plan, it don't go like I want it
Watch me roll this dope, watch me
Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me
[Chorus]
She ain't leave when I was broke
She ain't leave when I was broke
(She ain't leave when I was broke)
One thing that she didn't do
She ain't leave when I was broke (she ain't leave)
Don't ever tell her what I go through
But how she act, I know she know
I can see you was givin' up
And that's what killed me the most

[Verse 2]
We goin' shoppin' right now, I see they copy right now
I see they're watchin' right now
They didn't know I was just plottin' right now
I've been executin' the play for a while
Witnessed Chubbie Baby walk down the aisle
I got a few rings on me now
Had to change my team and my style
You can't intervene on my craft
You better turn your back right now
Ain't no turnin' back right now
I can't let you cramp my style
If you ain't blink then you lookin' like an owl
Stand right back 'cause you lookin' like coward
You end up stiff, sleepin' with the flowers (ditch)
She understand everything I go through
Gutta nigga always
[Pre-Chorus]
I had to climb out the sewer
Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'
Hold me down
Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it
Sometimes I try to be there for you
And my plan, it don't go like I want it
Watch me roll this dope, watch me
Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me

She ain't leave when I was broke
She ain't leave when I was broke

One thing that she didn't do
She ain't leave when I was broke (she ain't leave)
Don't ever tell her what I go through
But how she act, I know she know
I can see you was givin' up
And that's what killed me the most

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Call me when you leave
Ostentação, palavra que eu gosto de ouvir
Sand touch your toes when you cookin' breakfast
Pacific Ocean out the backyard lookin' sexy
Straight shot, codeine, no chase
Don't let your dreams go to waste

[Chorus]
I'ma need fresh air
What I need? Fresh air (what I need, what I need)
I need to get out on my own
It's been too long
Girl, I need

[Verse 1]
Move on
Opportunities come once a lifetime
Without you
Never broke, play yaself, don't forget I had that
Come on
Feelin' like Janet Jackson said, it's all for you
Never try to put the navigation, when I'm lookin' for it

[Refrain]
I'll be right back, I'm on auto-pilot for the week
I'll be right back
Bad, bad, but she lookin' badder every week

Tell me where the safety at
Tell me where the security at
Movin' up to bigger paper bag
Tell me, tell me, is it impossible
To do these drugs and fall in love?

[Chorus]
I'ma need fresh air
I'ma need fresh air
I need to get out on my own
It's been too long
Girl, I need

[Verse 3]
Ohhh
Sand touch your toes while you cookin' breakfast
Pacific Ocean out your backyard, lookin' sexy
Straight shot, codeine, no chase (no chase)
Don't let y'all dreams go to waste

I'll be right back, I'm on auto-pilot for the week
I'll be right back
Bad, bad, but she lookin' badder every week

If I need to breathe
Tell me why suffocate
If I need to breathe
Breathe, breathe
If I need to breathe
Breathe, breathe
We, we, we, we

[Verse 4]
I'm mad, I'm mad, you know that I'm mad
Tipped up the scale, now pullin' off to Dubai
I'm mad, I'm mad, you know that I'm mad
Where is the love tonight? Where is the drugs tonight?
I need that shit right away
I just need fresh air right away
I just need fresh air right away
All I need is fresh air

Song Description: Hardly is a trap ballad going over the pain Futures been through and how he gets through tough times.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
I remember it was New Year's
You was in the studio when I did "Chosen One"
My nigga Double D was there
I started sayin', "Louis V chinchilla," 'cause he had the chinchilla on and shit
For real, you know what I'm sayin'?
This that Super Future, Fire Marshall Future, Future Hendrix
You know, the Wizard, you understand me?
You dig? You dig what I'm sayin', man?

[Chorus]
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly
Hardly, hardly forget anything
Know I hardly forget anything, you know, ayy

[Verse 1]
Gutter nigga 'til the dirt
Margiela my fur
Almost overdosin' on Percs
Wakin' up, drinkin' that syrup
Bentley Spur with the curtains
Balenciagas my proteges

Wash the molly down with champagne
Wash the Xanny down with syrup, yeah
Hope it take away all this damn pain
Hope it take away all this damn pain

[Verse 2]
Crack in the bushes, I'm tryna buy me a new '88 Cutlass Supreme
Every day hustlin', I gotta go get it
I gotta get Wu-Tang, man, gotta get cream
Long as they print it, my niggas gon' get it
All of my love, I gave it to my city
All of that game you gave me, can't forget it
All that finesse you gave me, ain't forget it
I turned the whole world up, now they wanna treat me like an outcast or somethin'
These niggas so broke, instead of go and get it, they'd rather go ask for somethin'
Remember them days I had to load it up and put on my mask for somethin'
Remember we jugged for somethin'
Remember we take for somethin', yeah, yeah
I spent three stacks on these Rick Owens, I try my best to forget it
I pour my life inside these poems, my whole soul and my spirit
I'm easily agitated, get intoxicated tryna fight the demons
Tryna find right in my wrong, hope my legacy live on
Hope my legacy live on
That's why I wrote this song
I ain't have to write this song
Future Hendrix is forever
[Chorus]
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly
Hardly, hardly forget anything

I'm giving you my testimony line for line
I'm giving you the best of me, it's wrong or right
Somebody tell the kids they need to calm it down
I wanna hear your heart pump pound for pound
Show me everything I need to see on my blind side
Show me you gon' be there for the love of a real boy
I just wanna be there for my dogs, they need me
I just wanna be there for the game, that's easy
Crumble up some herb, we ain't gettin' no Z-Zs
Connoisseurs of purp, gotta give 'em a repeat
Turbo, sixty seconds in a Porsche on a one way
Amigos down in Texas, we gon' get us some grande
Cherish every minute, every second we vibe, baby

Parking lot dealership, I'm in to win
We can't fake the flaws, we can't do pretend
Can you keep it solid and don't ever bend?
We gon' need colossal, we gon' need colossal
Hold me down, down, down like a real shotta
We conversin' back and forth like we real partners
Spiritually, we bonded through the turmoil
I try my best to treasure, give a little more
I know you need my time, 'cause there's gwala comin'
I know you seen the wave comin' and you start runnin'
Don't you be afraid, I'ma guard you with my life
You listen to these blogs, they gon' tell you I ain’t right
Listen to your heart and we gon' ride for life
Shorty on the squad, she gon' ride for life (Free Bandz!)

So you wanna fall for the bad guy?

I hit her once and then she tried to shine on me
I passed her off like a blunt to the homies

We up the boulevard, it's way too real
They took away Morris Brown, shit was way too real
Grew up three minutes from downtown, shit get way too real
I got them Texas boppers on call, shit get way too trill
I got your ex tryna call, shit gettin' way too real
You know I'm with the shits, shit get way too real
Cartier frames on me, know I got them thangs on me
Panamera brain on me, you know I'm switchin' lanes in it
After I give you this game, you should never let a lame hit it
After I give you this game, you should never let a lame hit it
I'm the one, put all the rings on you
I'm the one took all the blame for it
I had to look at this lame have you
Try to figure out then why I ain't have you
I'ma give you everything, I ain't crabbin'
Give you everything you want, shit, I ain't crabby
You never had a nigga that's lame, trappin'
You turned on Daddy, that's lame & crappy
Hit that shit, now your name droppin'
Now I hit that shit, that's your name droppin'
Come over later, I mash in it
I lay her with it, I crashed in it
Lay in your bed, get grass in it
Let's smoke this blunt, got ashes in it

Nowadays, I deal with lawsuits
You tellin' me that's what it came to
Hookin' your panties and bras off
That's how a nigga remember you
After I hit it and splashed in it
You should never ever ever let a square get it
I'm the one put all the flames on you
I had you, tatted my name on you
You know them streets, they was callin' me back
I ain't gonna front like they ain't want ya
Money over bitches, that's the first lesson
That's money over bitches, that's the first lesson
Sleepin' on minks, that's no flexin'
Had you whippin' up a foreign, that's no question
Had you whippin' up a foreign, that's no question
I'm the one, give all this game to you
Had wheat Timbs on when I came to you
I don't want play with this lame business
I curled up in it and came in it
I gotta play with these cards given
Ain't never gonna have my heart in it
I got a gift and I'm God given
That's why I'm gon' live like Godzilla

Just a young hood nigga, streets raised me
Working with a unit, tryna stretch it to another one
Drinking on that Actavis, it tasting like some bubblegum
Thumbing through the check, boarding on a jet
Talking on the iPhone, sipping out the styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown
VVS and white stones, VVS and white stones
I'm rolling like a rolling stone
FreeBandz on Al Capone (Straight up)
And my cash way long (Turn up)
I see a bunch of clones
[Chorus]
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time, aye

[Verse 3]
Give me apartment and some water and I can swim
Got that Gambino jumping out the gym
My young nigga serving J's outside Crim
Jumping 'cross me, you know your chances slim
In my aviator Gucci like I'm driving planes
When the cash hit cash money, smell like cocaine
Doing Birdman numbers, making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler, jumping bail on your ring
Spent so much on Louis, gave me free champagne
In Bal Harbour shopping and they doing the same thing
And I keep my cup with me like a pimp
I think I'm Magic Don Juan, take a glimpse
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film (Movie!)
Future (Ask, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus]
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time, aye11Embed

Title: Hallucinating

Song Description: Future pays tribute and sticks to the theme of the album title, HNDRXX, over trippy chill production, with hallucinating nodding at his drug use.

The Chorus goes over the drugs Future ingests, and he insists that if youre getting higher than him, you must be tripping or hallucinating. On The Percocet & Stripper Joint, Future said I just tried acid for the first time, I feel good.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Astronaut
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I seduce you with this Aston Martin
I bought today
Oh, you done did more drugs than me?
You must be hallucinating
Oh, you did more percs than me?
Then you must be hallucinating
Don't menace over these Vicodins, you must've seen Satan
I seduce you with this Rolls Royce truck that's on the way
Chanel is on the invoice, I had bought the store today
That bitch get on my nerves, man
I had to send her out to Saint Tropez
Oh you done blow more cheques than me, boy?
Then you got to be hallucinating

[Post-Chorus]
I'm a young nigga with this cheque and I fuck it up
The freshest thing that I ever bought was that Bentley truck

[Verse 1]
I could turn a stripper to a diva
Chinchilla on her, that's a PETA
Shawty light the gun like Bonita
Rockstars goin' like the Beatles
I took styrofoams to the meeting
Three cellphones when you greet me
Got a bitch waiting in the lounge
I done had to move a few pounds

[Chorus]
I seduce you with this Aston Martin
I bought today
Oh, you done did more drugs than me?
You must be hallucinating
Oh, you did more percs than me?

All they ever do is bring more problems than listen to
My chains, my ring gon' bling, they do all the seducin'
I was kickin' shit with yo' bitch, she did all of the choosin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking at my chain, don't drown

Title: In Her Mouth
Release Date: February 12, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Future-in-her-mouth-lyrics
Song Description: Despite the title of the song being In Her Mouth, the only reference to anything having to do with In Her Mouth (and I think we know what he already means) is in the first line of the hook.

The majority of this track discusses Futures criminal life, purchasing and operating motor vehicles, as well as his love for codeine and drugs.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Super Future
Hey, you know how I rock it

[Hook]

Fuck that fake shit nigga, fuck that fraudulent pretending
Got young Doolie on the body and I really do miss her

Punching on the gas, I done rented me a bag though
Two hundred on the dash, baby this is not a Jaguar
You don’t have to ask, keep that hammer on me, MC
You show these niggas love and they gonna show you a barrel
It’s Taliban gang, we in a whole ‘nother era
Our money ain’t the same, I’m in a whole ‘nother bracket
It’s five thousand or better, what I spend on a jacket
Finesse a nigga momma in the hood when I’m trappin’
Praying about this karma when I count up my Franklins
These niggas don’t want drama, they some federal agents
Run inside your house for them coke leaves
They gon’ shoot you in the head if you the police

We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end

[Verse 1]
I could tell you was into me from our instant chemistry
As I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me
I'll go to war over you want, I dont give a fuck by showing you
You know what it is shawty, forever my lil shawty
Long as I’m swimmin’ in Benjamins, you shop with no limited
You reminisce every session, know you’ll come back again
I know you can’t breath without me, you gon' need your oxygen
I damn near gave you a overdose on my own medicine
I took a sip of your tea and I ain’t been right ever since
As I think to myself what’d it be is it heaven sent

If I did come your way and you feel like runnin’
Run in my direction and don’t you run from me
Cause any time we get together, we goin’ stuntin’
And I’m applyin’ major pressure, feel it in your stomach
It’s lightnin', it’s thunderin', you describin', got me wonderin'

Is there any place you rather be?
You walk until your feet get sore

My friendship a guarantee
You got my ego in another league
I ain’t tryna be cocky
I got your heart in my pocket

Title: Benz Friendz (Whatchutola)
Release Date: April 22, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Future-benz-friendz-whatchutola-lyrics
Song Description: Andre 3000 is awesome on Benz Friendz. His deadpan delivery is razor sharp. His layered, multi-dimensional approach to songwriting is indelible. You can almost feel his inquisitive fingers pushing each hook farther into the stratosphere.

Of course, Three-Stacks is awesome on everything. But in the case of Benz Friendz, Future wont completely hand over the keys. That is what makes the cut so special. Every time one pop-maestro raises the stakes, the other calls, then raises again. The verse-chorus structure eventually spins out, spiraling into four completely unique hooks, each seemingly good enough to be its own song. Its glorious, meticulous, and almost didnt happen. In fact, they added it post-mix. Future said in an interview with NPR:

We kept saying, Man, its missing something. We gotta add those different textures over the track. He kept telling me like, Man, you always want to keep going back over it over and over and over and see something you can hear. Every time you listen to the track, once they mix it, you might hear something else you want to put on the track. You cant be afraid to do it again just because you mixed the record. I know they spending they money on the mix but, man, you gotta do whats in your heart to make the track complete. So after we mixed it a few times, man, we went back over, did the third verse, did the intro and we built. Went in like, we built on that track for a few weeks.

This track is also a bit of a family affair. Rico Wade, part of the seminal production group Organized Noiseresponsible for much of Outkasts classic material (and this track)is also Futures cousin. This might explain why it differs sonically, compared to the rest of the album. Even Future said:

It sound like a Future/OutKast record.

Well, whatever it takes. So long as this is the result, we can only hope for more.
Lyrics:

[Intro: André 3000]
I told that bitch, I told that bitch
I told that bitch, I told that bitch (Yeah)

I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch

Oh, you greedy in Tahiti, I can seen your flaw
Ayy, tell that girl you 'bout to sell the work 'cause you tired of it
And see how she react when you're no longer in your Bimmer
Then she find out that the Bentley wasn't really rented
Can you sell a kilo? Help a nigga move a kilo?
Oh, you want the private jet to take a flight to Rio?
Can't no Maybach prevent a nigga from making mula
Oh, you gold-diggin', diggin', graveyard loser
Ain't none of my cars American, King of Zamunda (Hey)
Let's have a heart-to-heart, drink wine, make art (Whoa-oh)
Backseat of the Benzo, the AMG (Ayy)
Can you love a thug, is all make-believe

[Verse 2: André 3000]
I told the girl I'm 'bout to sell the Porsche, I'm tired of it
She go and told these folks I'm goin' broke, a smile poured
From my lips, 'cause if I'm broke, it's only hearted
Broken records from broken English, that's all it
Hol' up, and if I were, why?
Would you throw a party? (Can't have it)
Affection is so convenient when ballin'
Correction: These hoes don't mean it when fallin'
I guess that's why Lois can't be with Clark Kent
Fly on a nigga back while he Superman
But if I'm in a wheelchair, you still there?
Stop searchin' for words, I feel stupid, man
The shit is the Pittsburgh, I still care
White button downs and Emory scrubs
Had to write her birthday down because my memory sucks
But this shit comes back up like some acid reflux
Or a Michael Jackson jacket with some plastic zippers
I was zipping through the city and I'on't give a fuck
1994 Toyota Land Cruiser because
That bitch ain't never broke down on me
Why would I do that to her?
Simple-ism, symbolism, I'll pull up at a club
And might not never buy a new car again, if I can help it
'Cause if I buy one, they gon' sell ten, and what I'm left with?
Throw a nigga one on the strength, then we might could talk (Hey)
'Til then, I will ride my fuckin' bike, or walk—eh
[Chorus: André 3000]
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
And I don't want no bitch who need to have that kind of friendship
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
And I don't want no bitch who need that kind of nigga, scram, ho

[Verse 3: André 3000 & Future]
I told that girl, I told that girl tell the truth
Say she the realest bitch I ever met, then show me some proof
These girls be droppin' these lies, these girls be makin' shit up
She don't wanna stand in my line, she tryna come to the front
Yeah-uh, she love her country but hate American cars
For the shape of them, he'll have you know all of them bitches is foreign
If yellow seems to be the color in fashion
What happens to all of this good Black pussy he keep ignoring?
The world told him didn't shit rhyme with "orange"
The girl is only with him because he's touring
Well, go on, angel, I don't blame you, don't hang your head
I know it's survival for you, get it like a IOU
She's so materialistic
I'm just enjoying life, I'm living life, you know?
That worldwide pussy, yeah, worldwide pussy, yeah
Pull up at this girl crib bumping Lil' Boosie, yeah

Title: Never Satisfied
Release Date: April 22, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Future-never-satisfied-lyrics
Song Description: When originally announced that Drizzy would be featured on the track, fans expected much more than the 1:54 long interlude. Nevertheless, we find Future and Drake venting on no matter how much they have, enough never seems enough.

Its revealed that Drake did in fact drop a verse but asked to Future to remove it as he didnt like it.

Future explains why its so short (skip to the 13:00 mark):

http://youtu.be/NgarQE09EG0?t=14m

A little more than six months after Honest released, a full version of this song, complete with a Drake verse and all, was released.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Future]
​No matter what you do, it's never enough
​I don’t understand these bitches, Drizzy
​Trying though, they ain't never satisfied
EarDrummers, Mike WiLL Made-It
​
​[Chorus: Drake]
​Time after time after time
​Money's all I get and there's still money on my mind
​But I ain't never satisfied
Yeah, I ain't never satisfied
​I found the one and say, "I'll never cheat again"
​We don’t talk for like some months
I ended up fucking with her friend
I ain't never satisfied, I ain't never satisfied

[Bridge: Drake]
I'm putting pressure on these niggas and I know
But I still be on the road like I'm scared of going broke
Cause I ain't never satisfied
I ain't never satisfied

[Verse: Future]
And it's a lot of money in the room
I gotta find another spot, hiding soon
I mix the rosé with the purple juice
I hustle everyday and you don't have a clue
After you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew
My pain still runnin' deeper than the ocean
Ordered up ten thousand ones and I throw it
Name a bag in the store that she ain't got
Name a designer store that we ain't shop
They ain't never satisfied

Song Description: On All Bad, Future and Lil Uzi Vert both boast about the massive amount of females they have and the glamorous lifestyle that has come with their fame. The track features a very light and twinkly beat which fans immediately noted was sonically similar to Uzis March 2020 track Celebration Station.

Future released this track nine hours before the release of High Off Life in collaboration with MSCHF, a lifestyle company that is known for early and exclusive drops of products like sneakers and clothing. The company licensed 149 URLs on the highoff.shopping web page, with the track randomly showing up on one of the URLs every ten minutes.

Too many girls 'posed to call back, I got 'em all in line, they fiendin', yeah

She remind me of a pearl, yeah
I am way smarter than you, uh
You chase the nut like a squirrel, yeah
Drinkin' that pineapple juice, yeah
