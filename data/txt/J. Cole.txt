Artist: J. Cole, Alternate Names: Jermaine Cole, Jermaine Lamarr Cole, Young Simba
Artist Description: Jermaine Lamarr Cole (born January 28, 1985), better known as J. Cole, is a rapper and producer who was born in Frankfurt, Germany, and raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina. He gained a passion for rap at a young age and first went by the names Blaza and Therapist (the latter was given to him by Bomb Sheltah, a respected rap group from Fayetteville) before settling on his own name.

He first started getting recognition in 2007 with the release of his debut mixtape The Come Up. First, after a failed attempt to share a CD of his with Jay-Z, it would later be Hov, that would come to his attention after he heard Cole’s song “Lights Please”, Jay-Z would go on to make J. Cole his first signing to his then newly formed record label, Roc Nation, in 2009.

Since then he has become one of the biggest names of the “new school” era, with the release of five platinum-certified albums. His debut release Cole World: The Sideline Story defied industry expectations by selling over 200,000 copies in its first week without a top 40 hit single at the time and his sophomore Born Sinner, saw him go head-to-head with Kanye West in a now-iconic sales battle in Hip-Hop. Before this, Cole released two projects that would eventually become his Truly Yourz series, the third project debuted on the deluxe edition of Born Sinner.

Cole’s third LP, 2014 Forest Hills Drive was released without any radio single promoting it and would subsequently go on to become the first featureless rap album to go platinum in 25 years. It later became double platinum in June of 2016.

Cole dropped his fourth studio album 4 Your Eyez Only on December 9, 2016, the 2nd anniversary of 2014 Forest Hills Drive. Once again, the album went platinum with no credited features.

On April 20, 2018, Cole released his fifth studio album, KOD, a 12-track project that went featureless for a third consecutive time. However, the project debuted a new alter-ego of his, kiLL edward. The album made J. Cole the first artist to debut three songs in the Billboard Hot 100’s top 10 simultaneously, with “KOD” at #10, “Kevin’s Heart” at #8, and “ATM” at #6, then a career-best chart placement.

Following the release of KOD, Cole appeared on numerous tracks as features, perhaps most notably on Jay Rock’s June 2018 track “OSOM”, 21 Savage’s December 2018 track “a lot”, and 6LACK’s September 2018 track “Pretty Little Fears.”

On January 23rd, 2019, Cole released the T-Minus produced hit “MIDDLE CHILD”, which peaked at number 4 on the Billboard charts. The accompanying visuals were released on February 25th, 2019.

On May 15, 2021, Cole released his long-awaited sixth studio album The Off-Season containing 12 tracks, 10 of which being brand new.

Title: No Role Modelz
Release Date: December 9, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-no-role-modelz-lyrics
Song Description: J. Cole believes that shallow, materialistic L.A. hoes got that way because their only role models were talentless reality TV stars. But Cole also had no role models growing up, so what does that make him? A conflicted man who indulges in empty lust even though he knows it doesnt make him happy.

No Role Modelz was already a fan favorite on Coles tour before being released as the fourth single from his third album, 2014 Forest Hills Drive. The fuck Hollywood theme of the album, which traces his own rise and response to fame, is particularly clear in this songs lyrics.

The songs hook interpolates Project Pats 2001 hit Dont Save Her, and the track was produced by Phonix Beats and J. Cole. A clip of a speech by President George W. Bush is featured in an interlude before the songs bridge.

Cole said a few words about the inspiration behind No Role Modelz while on tour:

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
First things first: rest in peace, Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in White neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 3]
I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
"I'ma need my shirt back" (Nigga, you know how it go)
[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
Fool me—can't get fooled again

Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
[Verse 4]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

[Pre-Chorus]
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), yeah, ayy

A black star, Mos Def, Kweli

Title: Power Trip
Release Date: February 14, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-power-trip-lyrics
Song Description: In 2013, Cole dropped Born Sinners lead single just in time for Valentines Day. His Facebook page stated this was a continuation of Dreams, a track off of his second mixtape, The Warm Up.

According to Cole himself the song has a double meaning, with the song not only about his love for a girl, but his love for hip-hop and how its got him up all night trying to create chart topping love songs.

A Power trip by definition is:

A self-aggrandizing quest for ever-increasing control over others

This definition fits both Dreams and Power Trip in that Cole is so obsessed with a girl, that hes willing to kill for her (in the music video, he actually does). It also explains his rise to stardom and how he wants to progress in the rap industry as well. He only wants to keep getting bigger and better.

Read how they mixed the track, and why it took them 10 days, on soundonsound.
Lyrics:

[Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Got me up all night
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song "Dreams" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night

All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, "Give me twenty dollars, dollars!"
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: "Please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—
[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

[Chorus 2: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are

Title: Wet Dreamz
Release Date: December 9, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-wet-dreamz-lyrics
Song Description: On the third single from Forest Hills Drive, Cole reminisces about his first time with a girl. He puts on the typical play-it-cool attitude when in reality all he knows about are wet dreams. This song was originally going to appear on Coles debut album, Cole World: The Sideline Story but missed the cut.

The song caused a stir amongst fans as it contradicts Coles earlier comments on losing his virginity from Too Deep For The Intro. Was it with a virgin or a slutty bitch?

Coles manager Ibrahim Hamad would later reveal that Wet Dreamz is a fictional story and that he doesnt know who Coles first smash was.



The music video was released on April 21st 2015 and plays on the idea of puppy love literally. Ryan Staake directs a German shepherd playing Cole and a King Charles Spaniel playing his crush on their first time. On the visuals, Ryan said:

I loved the idea of viewers hearing something ultra sexual while seeing something totally cute and adorable, and the potential to give them this mental glitch of this looks too cute to be sexy.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Cole
Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

[Verse 1]
First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin', I want it bad
And I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, "You ever had sex before?" Damn…
You might also like[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
"Of course I had sex before," knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'."
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
"Yeah, baby, sound like a plan."
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin, fuck
[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you know that feelin' when you
Know you finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
And most of all I'm prayin', "God, don't let me bust quick"
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go? Right
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top and then she
Get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
"I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—"
[Chorus]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

Title: Crooked Smile
Release Date: June 4, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-crooked-smile-lyrics
Song Description: Using his own imperfect set of teeth as an example, Cole reaffirms his belief that nobodys perfect, as everyone has their own crooked smile, and that nobody has to be perfect, making worrying pointless. The first and second verse are directly addressed to women unhappy with their appearance, while in the third verse, Cole transfers the matter to society.

A Billboard editor commented saying this track is an uplifting ode to all those who continue to hold their heads up, especially women, and the importance of inner beauty. Consider this Coles take on Billy Joels classic Just the Way You Are.

Born Sinners second single features TLCs T-Boz and Chili, additionally sampling Jennifer Hudsons No One Gonna Love You, borrowing her tracks keys and her vocals which can be heard faintly during his verses.

The music video doesnt so much focus on the song, but is rather a message of peaceboth in the community and our minds. It was dedicated to a 7-year-old girl who was shot during a 2010 raid by the Detroit SWAT.

Cole later went on to release the previously unheard original cut as a part of his Revenge of the Dreamers album. Going in a different direction to the version we now know, the original focused primarily on his own crooked smile, detailing how it made him feel inadequate and insecure. It didnt feature any guest vocals and used a different beat.

Watch J. Cole talk about what the song means to him:

https://youtu.be/XCBBxd5XhXA?t=2
Lyrics:

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill 'cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can't face what's wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?!"
What it's like to have a crooked smile
You might also like[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim 'cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful, you can't be sure
'Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
'Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be
And that's you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile
[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em
Look at the nation
That's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, 'cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let's make a mil'
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain't snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn't need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?
[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Ad-Libs: Choir]

[Outro: Choir]
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

Title: MIDDLE CHILD
Release Date: January 23, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-middle-child-lyrics
Song Description: J. Coles first offering of 2019 serves as a warning in advance of an extensive rollout of Dreamville material. On the track, Cole envisions himself in the center of the old and new generations of hip-hop, therefore making him the middle child of rap.

Middle Child Syndrome is a psychological condition in which middle children sometimes feel neglected by their families due to the attention that their younger and older siblings receive.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
You good, T-Minus?

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real

I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Verse 2]
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga
[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

Title: Love Yourz
Release Date: December 9, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-love-yourz-lyrics
Song Description: Cole draws back to the intro and its main themes as he comes full circle back to present day. A much wiser Cole reflects on the most important things in life, such as love and happiness.

He personalizes this theme and touches on his experiences with the glamorous life that he has seemingly become disillusioned with.

Think being broke was better
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Hm, love yours
Hm, love yours
No such thing

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Post-Chorus]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive ('Live, live, live)
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived ('Rived, rived, rived)
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words and listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less
Compared to some my niggas down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairy tale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Think being broke was better)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours

[Verse 2]
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I ask for strength from the Lord (Man) up above
'Cause I been strong so far, but I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good, get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better, now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV, see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely, and as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga, feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours
[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing, no such thing
[Post-Chorus]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive ('Live, live, live)
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived ('Rived, rived, rived)

Title: Deja Vu
Release Date: December 9, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-deja-vu-lyrics
Song Description: On Deja Vu, Cole raps from the perspective of his deceased friend James McMillan Jr., who imagines a conversation with a woman about the kind of men she gravitates towards. He believes that he can unseat these guys if she would only give hima small town guy from the streetsa chance.

After this song was released, controversy sprung up surrounding its production because the beat sounded eerily similar to Bryson Tillers 2015 hit Exchange. In an interview with Billboard, Dreamville president Ibrahim Hamad confirmed that this song was actually recorded for Coles previous album 2014 Forest Hills Drive, meaning it was produced before the Exchange beat.

This song was also J Coles highest charting song until 2019s MIDDLE CHILD.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Huh, ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft-spoken
I came to talk to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you (Feeling you)
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
Huh, I'm staring at you from afar
I'm wondering 'bout you, like where you from and who you are
'Cause you a star, no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type that light the night time
I heard you got a man, but who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine, huh

She fuck with small-town niggas, I got bigger dreams (Bigger dream), yeah

Title: Apparently
Release Date: December 9, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-apparently-lyrics
Song Description: Closing in on the final tracks of the 2014 Forest Hills Drive project, Cole reflects on the decisions hes made in life and tries to make them right, now knowing how much people believe in him and look up to him.  He expresses gratitude towards his girlfriend and his mother, apologizing to his mom and recognizing that his girl believes in him.

The second verse isnt quite as nostalgic. Cole switches tones and shows off, using wordplay. He brags about his rap skills, possibly showing he hasnt fully grasped everything he needs to know in life, but its starting to come together before the final track. Cole plays with two sides of his own narrativeat first, appreciating and recognizing the people that helped him succeed, and then, showing off the very skills that got him to where he is today.

This song was nominated for a Grammy in 2016, for Best Rap Performance.

The video debuted the same day as the albums release:

[Intro]
Oh, right, oh
Oh, why, na-da-da-da, da, ah

I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom, uh
I want my dreams to rescue me

This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you 'cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish? I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn, she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show, I love her just like I love you, and
I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together, uh
I love you mama, uh

[Verse 2]
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right, I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat 'em up and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you, nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's an AP, nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me, nigga— huh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes, so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view," waiting on thanks from a few
'Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard, but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing, and getting head like a coin toss, too easy
[Chorus]
I keep my head high, uh
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom, uh
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong, uh

Title: Kevin’s Heart
Release Date: April 20, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-kevins-heart-lyrics
Song Description: In Kevins Heart, Cole is singing from the stance of a person in love with drugs. Throughout the track, he references taking Xannies and smoking blunts, and relates the use of drugs to potentially cheating on his partner.

The title itself is a reference to actor and comedian Kevin Hart, who admitted to cheating on his wife and mother of his child. The music video of the track prominently features Hart, receiving judgement from people in the public but ultimately recognizing his own mistakes as a growth opportunity. This runs parallel with Coles own cheating nature, and also ties into the overall message of the album  to Choose Wisely.

These lines could be a reference to an actual woman that he doesnt want to cheat on. She could also mean the drug that the person may be attempting to sell him as later in the same pre-chorus he says, If I take this cookie now one day Ill do the time, which could literally send him to jail.

The line relates to the title Kids On Drugs as the point of view of the song is someone attempting to stay away from the drugs they had once filled their life with. It also relates to Kill Our Demons because the demon, in this case, would be lust. The person would be attempting to kill the lust within them in an attempt to be loyal to his significant other. Lastly, King OverDosed is about Cole himself. In the past, Cole has referenced his cheating nature on tracks like She Knows. Cole is most likely referencing and taking aim at his addiction to cheating in the earlier stages of his life.
Lyrics:

[Pre-Chorus]
She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

[Chorus]
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get to skrrt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

[Verse 1]
All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

[Bridge]
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror

[Pre-Chorus]
She my number one I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time
[Verse 2]
I love her, I don't want to lose her
I'm selfish, I know that I use her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My actions I know they confusin'
At home I look happy as usual
On the road I'm a mack, I'm a chooser
I'm a addict, I'm maskin' that
Kevin's Heart

[Outro]
They tell me "What's done in the dark
Will find a way to shine"
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
What's done in the dark will always find a way to shine
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind162Embed

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for you, either way it go
Tell me, girl, why you be stressin' me for time? (Time, time, time, time, time, time)
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn, my nigga, why you actin' like a bitch? (Bitch, bitch, bitch)
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here, baby, why you always insecure? ('Cure, cure, cure, cure, cure, cure)
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 1]
Yeah, ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fadin' you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My Uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, 'cause niggas say they the one
And I got somethin' to prove
Forgive me, Lord, here they come, blaow

[Verse 2]
My inhibition's fightin' my intuition
Premature premonition, showin' me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscin'
You want the truth? Well, come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked your phone and saw it was a number missin'
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fried, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole, you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me, blaow

Nigga, why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for you, either way it go

Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Bridge]
(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom, nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt (Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
(Who's the king?)
You tell me you still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know (Who's the king?)
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it (Yeah)
[Verse 3]
Listen, history repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each other's flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock 'n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I'll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang, nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?
[Outro]
We all kings (We all kings, nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game (Hehehaha)
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it (True)
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a bang, the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gon' be no more kings (Ain't gon' be no more kings)
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power (Mm)
In reality he's a coward (Mm)
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side (The other side, ayy)
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I (Yessir)
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God (It's only one God, nigga)
It's for all the kings (Uh)
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved744Embed

Release Date: December 9, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-4-your-eyez-only-lyrics
Song Description: 4 Your Eyez Only serves as a message to James McMillian, Jr.s newborn daughter, recounting memories. James McMillian, Jr. is a friend whom Cole speaks of throughout the album.

James' life story is first recounted, falling to the temptations of the world, and later shares his attempts to stay on the path of righteousness. Coles life has parallels like falling in love and having a child. Cole got out of the streets, but his friend did not.
Lyrics:

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dyin' on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothin' but a criminal
Control the block, servin' up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they lettin' off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no comin' back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressin' me
Like I ain't the one who put them Js on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screamin', "Fuck the law," my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wipin' toilets
But these felonies be makin' life the hardest
Resistin' the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike, and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only
You might also like[Chorus: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You prolly grown now, so this song'll hit you
If you hearin' this, unfortunately means that I'm no longer with you
In the physical, not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me prayin' that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writin' this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizin' in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushin' paraphernalia
But daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hangin'
Blood was stainin' the concrete
Older niggas I loved, talked like they was above
Maintainin' a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business, by the age of thirteen
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinkin':
"What the fuck we namin' this girl?"
I told her, "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of (Most prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen)
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm livin' fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catchin' up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand
[Chorus: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand? (Hope you understand)
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand? (Hope you understand)
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger-happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blastin' frustrated 'cause the cash runnin' out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time duckin' school, duckin' cops
Duckin' rules, huggin' blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doin' time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearin' 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feelin' your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listenin' now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person like I'm teachin' you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only
[Chorus: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feelin'
What he'd been dealin' with lately, he wasn't tellin'
I tried to pick his brains, still, he wasn't revealin'
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chillin', he said:
"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothin', when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, beggin' you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleepin' at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects"
I had to interject like:
"Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout? Fuck is you gettin' at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been havin' premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feelin' I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm livin' on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready"
And so I'm leavin' you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later, makin' sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first to get some pussy, twelve years old
Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from baggin' up them grams to servin' O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law"
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
For your eyes only233Embed

Title: KOD
Release Date: April 20, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-kod-lyrics
Song Description: Although no cell phones were allowed in J. Coles April 16th, 2018 listening party, one fan managed to sneak one in and posted the audio to the title track for Coles 2018 project KOD.

On the track itself, Cole flexes towards the audience and his competition on the first verse, whilst simultaneously addressing comments about features on his album. The second verse and the chorus of the song elaborate more about Coles youth and the drugs that his surroundings got him involved in.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick

[Verse 1]
Wow, niggas been crampin' my style
Blowin' my high, they want a reply
The number one question is, "How?"
How does it feel now that you on?
How much you worth? How big is your home?
How come you won't get a few features?
I think you should? How 'bout I don't?
How 'bout you just get the fuck off my dick?
How 'bout you listen and never forget?
Only gon' say this one time, then I'll dip
Niggas ain't worthy to be on my shit
Haven't you heard? I'm as cold as the tip
Tip of the iceberg that tipped the Titanic
No tip-toein' around it, my shit is gigantic
As big as the fuckin' Atlantic, I'm lit, bitch

[Verse 2]
How I grew up, only few would've loved
'Member I got my first view of the blood
I'm hangin' out and they shoot up the club
My homie got pharmaceutical plug
I smoke the drug and it run through my vein
I think it's workin', it's numbin' the pain
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Yeah, at this shit daily, sipped so much Actavis
I convinced Actavis that they should pay me
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
Platinum wrist ridin' in back like Miss Daisy
Platinum disc and I own masters, bitch, pay me
Y'all niggas trappin' so lack-sical-daisy
My nigga sell crack like it's back in the '80s
Know a young nigga, he actin' so crazy
He serve a few packs and he jack a Mercedes
He shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
He don't give a fuck if them crackers gon' hang him
Bitches been askin', "What have you done lately?"
I stacked a few M's like my last name was Shady
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me
[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit

Title: 1985
Release Date: April 20, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-1985-lyrics
Song Description: 1985 is representative of the year J. Cole was born. When combined with 2014 Forest Hills Drives January 28th, Coles entire birthday is in his discography.

The song is a message to up-and-coming rappers, warning them about the realities of the rap game and advising them on how to maintain success. Cole adopts the tone of an older, more experienced mentor. The song is interpreted as targeting a multitude of new rappers, including Lil Pump, Smokepurpp, and 6ix9ine, among others. He compares his experiences to theirs, responding to their sometimes senseless actions with the wish that they learn from their recklessness, just as he did when he was their age.

The song concludes the story of KOD and is an introduction to Coles next album, The Fall Off.
Lyrics:

1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em dissed me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years, you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop, niggaYou might also like241Embed

Title: Neighbors
Release Date: December 9, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-neighbors-lyrics
Song Description: Neighbors draws inspiration from an incident on March 18th, 2016 involving the house Cole rented (nicknamed Sheltuh) in North Carolina to use as a studio. The house was raided by SWAT team members after complaints from neighbors who assumed the house was being used to produce and sell drugs. No narcotics were found.

The story was originally told by Dreamvilles Elite, a producer credited multiple times on 4 Your Eyez Only, when he spoke with Complex to confirm that most of 4 Your Eyez Only is not from Coles perspective, but Neighbors on the other hand is.

This beat is actually the instrumental of his 2013 track Forbidden Fruit played in reverse. He revealed it during a concert in Anaheim, CA.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
'pologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this, the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door
You might also like[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well, motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn
[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope

I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

I'm movin' back to south side
So much for integration

Title: A Tale of 2 Citiez
Release Date: December 9, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-a-tale-of-2-citiez-lyrics
Song Description: A Tale of Two Cities is a novel by Charles Dickens, set in London and Paris before and during the French Revolution. Some of its major themesrebellion, conflict between rich and poor, coming to political consciousnesshover in the background of J. Coles song.

He is telling a story of one city, but from two different perspectives. Both characters are young men who want to escape the city and be more fortunate, but they try to achieve this by different means. In the first verse, hes an adolescent viewing all of the negativity and trying to become a successful writer of some sort, while in the second verse hes a peer indulging in all of the negatives, robbing people and selling drugs. In the second chorus it is revealed that the person who robbed the person from verse one in the first chorus is actually the  person from verse two.

During an interview with Tavis Smiley, Cole explains that the song compares the two sides of Fayetteville; the affluent area of Forest Hills Drive where he currently resides, opposed to the impoverished crime-ridden inner city. Its a topic Cole has touched on before, most notably on the Friday Night Lights cut, 2Face:

Yeah I seen heaven, seen hell
The two faces of the Ville
One side dreams, the other sides real
One side schemes, the other side deals
Lyrics:

[Produced by Vinylz]

[Intro]
Uh

[Verse 1]
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me, my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees, my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need, my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see, my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?
[Chorus 1]
Last night I had a bad dream (Bad dream, bad dream)
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing? (Bad thing, bad thing)
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
(What's the value of a thing?) Guess not
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Small town nigga, Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me 'til you get it how could you know?
How could you know? (How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know?)
How could you know? (How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know?)
[Verse 2]
Listen up, I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Fuck with me, my nigga
We gon' circle 'round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some trees, my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see, my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key, my nigga
Listen up, I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to, nigga
Me, I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too, nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do, nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let 'em kill your dream
It'll haunt you, nigga, haunt you
[Chorus 2]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things? (What's the value of a thing?)
Guess not
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is, nigga, run that shit right now)
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Outro]
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command375Embed

Title: Forbidden Fruit
Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-forbidden-fruit-lyrics
Song Description: In the bible, Book Genesis, Adam and Eve are led into temptation by the serpent (the devil) and taste from the fruit that God had forbidden them to eat. This act, the fall of man, is the foundation of the Christian belief of original sin and the idea that all humans are born sinnersthe concept of J. Coles 2013 album on which this song is the eleventh track.

J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar use the biblical narrative of Adam and Eve taking a bite out of the forbidden fruit as an analogy to modern day temptations, talking about the things we do knowing we shouldnt.

This song samples Ronnie Fosters Mystic Brew. A Tribe Called Quest used this instrumental in Electric Relaxation, and Kendrick Lamar used the same sample on his song with Jay Rock, Enjoy Life.
Lyrics:

[Produced by J. Cole]

[Chorus: J. Cole & Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Lil' sip, took a lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, t-took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
'Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Blaow

Me and my bitch, took a little trip

Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Outro: J. Cole]
Don't shit last, don't shit last and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
What up Queens
Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a dollar and a dream, and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that
Bitch, bitch

Be at all the shows everybody be like, bitch
Bitch, bitch
Or you can do the low cool shit, bitch

[Produced by Willie B]

[Intro]
La la la
La la la la la
La la la (Yeah)
La la la la la (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I grew up, a fucking screw up, tie my shoe up
Wish they was newer, damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now, I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm tryna stay alive, in the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? (La la la)
Ayy, who am I? (La la la la la, yeah)
You might also like[Chorus]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall, just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Verse 2]
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga [inaudible] slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CDs and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller with more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back
I peeped game, got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard, pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her, "Hello", and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing, his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn't my mans, I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be, that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You 'bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us, why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained
About my lack of gear and thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Ayy, who am I?
[Chorus]
Things change, rearrange and so do I (Ayy, who am I?)
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie (Who am I?)
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall, just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

Title: Work Out
Release Date: June 15, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-work-out-lyrics
Song Description: After Who Dat failed to become a chart topper, J. Cole released Work Out as the second single off his debut album three months prior to its release, on June 5th, 2011, the second year anniversary of his acclaimed mixtape, The Warm Up.

Although the song achieved great commercial success (reaching #13 on the Hot 100 and going double platinum), it was received negatively by Coles core fans, and we would later find out that Nas wasnt a fan either.

The song samples Kanye Wests The New Workout Plan and the lyrics from the outro are taken from Paula Abduls song Straight Up.

According to Complex Magazine, J. Cole doesnt like the song:

Despite sampling Kanye Wests The New Workout Plan on his single Work Out, he considers it the worst song on The College Dropout.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I want to see you work out for me, work out for me

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 1]
She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing

Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 2]
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right
[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then (Cole World)

[Outro]
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)

Well straight up, I tell ya

But see, I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath (Mmm)
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step (Mmm)
As we speak, I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness got 'em overwhelmed
(Mmm, "Please, God, I want to go to Heaven")
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail (Mmm)
See, I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand (Mmm)
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife  (Mmm), like

[Chorus: J. Cole, J. Cole & Ari Lennox, & Ari Lennox]
I know you desperate for a change, let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside

I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates (Mmm)
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel, 'cause I'm supposed to have a halo (Mmm)
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly (Mmm)
Fiends wan' get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do? I just supply
It's economics, my business ain't got the suit and tie (Oh, wait)
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine (Oh, wait)
I can't oblige, dawg, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga, huh (Mmm)

Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little

You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little (Oh, no)
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more (Oh, oh, no)
"Time is short," that's what somebody told me (Told me, oh)
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Ayy, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge: J. Cole & Ari Lennox]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands (Ooh)
All of a sudden, niggas poppin' trunk and then we scram (Mmm)
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man (Ooh, yeah)
Eyes wide, that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills (Ooh)
Bloodshed done turned the city to a battlefield (Mmm)
I call it poison, you call it real, that's how you feel?
(Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop)
[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go) Body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, 'cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
'Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was twenty-two
(Last night at around 7:45) He was twenty-two
(Twenty-two year old black male, suspect, reporting on the news)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh, no)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr. (No)
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro)
We got to do better, people
Twenty-two years old, this boy was too young (Oh my God)
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentlemen
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words (I'ma kill them niggas)
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Awwwww...haha

[Verse 1]
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' "Dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga, I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

[Chorus]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die

Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M, nigga, that green

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled

'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, "Make it quick if the Lord take me"
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, "Sell dope, rap or go to NBA"
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen109Embed

[Intro]
Ayo
Ayo
Ayo, ah
Ayo, ah
Ayo
Ayo
Ayo, ah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Who you had to kill? Who you had to rob? Who you had to fuck
Just to make it to the top, damn it?
Or maybe that's daddy money; escalator, no ladder money
Escalade, new Caddy money
Worst fear - goin' broke, 'cause I'm bad with money
Crooked smile nigga, momma never had the money, damn
I ain't trippin'
Nigga Jordan, I ain't Pippen, yeah
Up the steps, I ain't slippin', tears
Blood, sweat, and I ain't crippin', here's
A song you can sing along wit'
When you down on some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home 'cause she got a second job
Deliverin' pizzas, you think she out there gettin' robbed
Please God, watch her, I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talkin' all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog, now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga, plus dawg
I'm a grown man now, I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
I'd be glad it's that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty, now it's back to broke
Refund checks, used that to float
Momma gets depressed, falls in love with the next maniac
On crack, use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writin' rhymes, try and bring back the hope
Tried to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Coulda drowned, but I grabbed the rope

And there go you

Sellin' me dreams and tellin' me things you knew

[Chorus]
You got what I want
I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?" (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But e'ry fuckin' verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now
Hear my shit, you try switch now
Know you felt the shit just now
Know you felt the shit just now, ha
Ain't there more to you?
Don't it ever get borin' to you?
I realize deep down you a coward gettin' high off of power
Fuck it more to you, saw through you
And it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo' money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect, but it came with fame
I just wanted love, but this ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane and watched lil Jermaine
Do his thang before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat, he gave it all he got
And now the nigga don't paint the same, damn
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be rainin' in
Spend a hundred thou' for the chain again
Think of old-school niggas like Dana Dane
Prolly kill for another claim to fame, my brain just sayin'
"Yeah, nigga, least he ain't insane
Least he ain't insane"
You ain't crazy, ma'fucker, you just 'fraid of change, ayy
That's new
Maybe that's true
But listen here, I got a bigger fear:
One day that I become you when I become lost
And I become heartless
And numb from all the ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now, I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
'Cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme, I know
Money can't save your soul
[Pre-Chorus]
But there go you
There go you
There go you
Sellin' me dreams and tellin' me things you knew
And there go you
And there go you
And there go you
Sellin' me dreams and tellin' me things you knew
Sing

[Chorus]
You got what I want
I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want
I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Outro]
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

Song Description: January 28 happens to be J. Coles birthday. With an album named after his childhood home, he begins taking us on a tour through his life starting with his earliest years.

Since Cole is signed to Jay Zs Roc Nation, its no coincidence that the second track off Jay Zs  fabled Black Album is December 4th  Jiggas own birthday.
Lyrics:

[Produced by J. Cole & Team Titans]
[Intro]
Rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade, for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)

Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)

[Verse 2]
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window 'cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me 'cause I  love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights full of Hennessy
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
'Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said 'son'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, nigga
[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)
It's one thing you do (It's one thing you do)
Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)

[Verse 3]
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the god
Nah you ain't the god
Nigga, Cole the god (Cole the god, Cole the god)

Lyrics:

Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it

[Verse 1]
I know that it's difficult
I'm stackin' this paper, it's sort of habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math

Proceed with caution
I heard if you chase it only results in
A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion

Thank God mama couldn't afford the abortion
The loneliest orphan
I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'
Now Cole, he important
My niggas beside me like Tommy and Martin
We ball on your court and
Then skate with your bitch like we Tonya Harding
She don't need her garments
She horny from all the money we countin'

Lyrics:

[Produced by J. Cole]
[Intro: J. Cole & Nas]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's bein' born, same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name

[Refrain: J. Cole]
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
[Verse 1: J. Cole]
I used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read 'em in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'da thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play and
I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, soundin' sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, "You the one, yo, why you make that shit?"
[Chorus: J. Cole]
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

[Refrain: J. Cole]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made "You Owe Me", dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par when I followed my heart?
Granted, my heart was tainted by my mind that kept on sayin', "Where's the hits? You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none,"
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcomes, huh
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, studied they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game
[Chorus: J. Cole]
But on the way I let Nas down
Damn, I got no one to blame
I'm ashamed, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you could never understand, fuck it

[Refrain: J. Cole]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core then I can open the door
Reintroduce 'em to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OGs for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose, I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it, how could you fail to respect it?
You might also like[Chorus: J. Cole]
Letting Nas down
I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it

[Refrain: J. Cole]

Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin

Title: False Prophets
Release Date: December 1, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-false-prophets-lyrics
Song Description: On False Prophets, Cole addresses the trials and tribulations of being a star. Though he refrains from name-dropping, Cole uses this track to fire shots at a few people, particularly Kanye West. In a May 2018 interview with Power 105s Angie Martinez, Cole confirmed that part of the first verse did, in fact, apply to Kanye.

The instrumental for False Prophets was composed by Freddie Joachim. The instrumental has been used by multiple artists, most notably by Joey Bada$$ on his song Waves. Cole made sure to get Joeys blessing before releasing this song.

The track did not appear on Coles fourth studio album 4 Your Eyez Only because it disrupted the narrative.

In the aforementioned interview with Angie Martinez, Cole also stated that this song was originally meant to be a part of his sixth studio album, The Fall Off.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

[Verse 1]
Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it
Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it

[Verse 2]
I got a homie, he a rapper and he wanna win bad
He want the fame, the acclaim, the respect that's been had
By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, this shit is depressin'
And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me?
False prophets
[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 3]
These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
I'm on some thankful shit
But the real God is in you, not the music you coppin'
I hear my old shit and know I can top it
False prophets
[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

Release Date: February 7, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-nobodys-perfect-lyrics
Song Description: This Missy collab features Cole talking about the ladies and wondering about his girls number.  Maybe he should talk to Anna Faris.

Lyrics:

[Intro: J. Cole]
Hey, oh yeah
Uh, Cole world
Uh, oh yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look, Mama, we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese, eggs, and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato's
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' 'bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that leftover lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
And tell me, why we gotta argue 'bout the same thing, same thing
Well

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat, Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, ay

I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox

But baby, where your roommates?
Did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed but her shit together
Now that I'm on I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose

Title: Villuminati
Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-villuminati-lyrics
Song Description: Cole sets the mood for Born Sinner, which is also an ongoing theme, by wittingly announcing this body of work way darker this time  the previous time being his debut album.

Villuminati is about the pressure Cole feels to succeed with Born Sinner. He is torn between making original music and staying true to himself on one side, and making marketable radio music, selling his artists soul to the devil on the other side.

He subliminally uses two artist and the Illuminati to portray this struggle: Jay Z, who signed Cole and who is often accused of being a member of the Illuminati, symbolizes the evil side dedicated to radio hits and profit with which he can brag, while Tupac, who has an album titled Don Killuminati, symbolizes the good side dedicated to rap as an artform.

The songs title incorporates the suffix of the name of his hometown  Ville (as in Fayetteville, North Carolina) and the prefix of the notorious Illuminati organization.

This intro track emphasizes the irony that, although we are born pure and innocent, we have innate evil within us and yet we continuously try to live our lives by bending around it while others choose to succumb to this evil; hence the stylisation of his name (the halo representing good" and the devil horns representing evil) that hed used for years.



In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Cole states that he does not believe in the Illuminati occult and also that those who are led to believe are dumb & gullible. He also said in a Hot 93.7 interview that he once loved to watch Illuminati Conspiracy videos.

Lyrics:

[Intro: Choir & J. Cole]
I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, I swear
It's way darker this time
*Laughs*

[Chorus: J. Cole & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov, now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Cole, time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Sometimes I brag like Hov, sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough, look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet, I'm real life hot, homie
Get your weight up, fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots
And I don't mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot
Okay, faggot? Uh
Don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass, that's between you and whoever else's dick it is
Pause, maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya? Boy Meets World, I'm tryna find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James, wait a minute, that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say fuck it
If the hoes like it I love it, nigga, nigga, nigga
Used to watch Rap City, Big Tigga, Tigga
Rap nerd, even copped Rah Diggah, Diggah
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie
I was only like 11 so forgive me
A decade later I'd be all up in the city
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it it was fuck him again
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know in a year he'd be fucking paying me, what could you say to me? I
Beat the odds like Vegas, I used to rap about haters
Before niggas was hating me, now they hate to see
A young black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free, pardon me

Got the game back, and I ain’t ever letting go

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I'm the prince of the city, I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parts where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
And so I'm wondering really what could you actually tell me
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops 'cause he's sorry
Fucked up education, would ask for reparations
But I’m probably just gon' go and buy Ferraris, vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the TV so the demons in 'em
I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil, now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul
[Bridge: J. Cole]
My nigga, I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
But the Devil don't play fair

[Refrain: J. Cole]
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
These next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati;
Is you stupid, nigga? Young black millionaire
Old white billionaires, I'm sure that they can do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would've been a summa cuma laude
Beyoncé told me that she want to cop the blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth, I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward, awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward, awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
I'm praying I don't see 'em at the Oscars, Oscars
[Interlude: J. Cole]
Hey J. Cole, this way, hey
Oh, hey, what's up? What's goin' on with you? Okay
Big smile, man, big smile, let me see that crooked smile
J. Cole, J. Cole, this way, look this way
Oh friend hug, friend hug, just keep it friendly
We friends, friends

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Re-adjustin' my target audience, 'cause it's obvious
I've gone astray, losing my way like Timberlake
Produced by Timbaland on that goddamn FutureSex/LoveSounds
What's playing in my mind, just the sound of my whole career
Crash and burning, the thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years until I let the Devil steer
Now what have we here? Mask my tears, but I

[Bridge: J. Cole, Yolanda DeBerry & Tanikka Myers]
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again

Title: 7 Minute Drill
Release Date: April 5, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-7-minute-drill-lyrics
Song Description: 7 Minute Drill serves as the anticipated response to Kendrick Lamars disses on Like That, which were aimed at Cole and Drake. Establishing this track as a warning shot, Cole interpolates lyrics from his mentor JAY-Zs famous Nas diss track Takeover and casts shade on the consistency and quality of Kendricks discography.

This is the second time Coles used the 12th and final track of a project as a diss response, the first time being 1985 on his 2018 project KOD.

This tracks title references Coles 7 Minute Drills, where he gives himself seven minutes to write as an exercise. He has spoken about this practice numerous times in interviews and documentaries, and has taught this practice to his Dreamville artists and frequent collaborators. This title implies that this response was composed during a seven-minute drill,  which was likely chosen to emphasize the ease that Cole can write with.

Not even 48 hours after the songs release, Cole would publicly apologize for the track and insist on removing it from streaming platforms during his performance at Dreamville Fest 2024 on April 7th:

I moved in a way that I spiritually feel bad on. I tried to jab my nigga back and keep it friendly, but at the end of the day, when I listen to it and when I see the talk, that shit dont sit right with me with my spirit. That shit disrupts my fucking peace. So what I want to say right here tonight, is that in the midst of me doing that  trying to find a little angle and downplay this niggas catalog and greatness  how many people here think Kendrick Lamar is one of the greatest motherfuckers to ever touch the fucking microphone? [] I aint gonna lie to y'all, [the] past two days felt terrible, like, it let me know how good I been sleeping these past ten years [] We taking that song off of fucking streaming services, nigga.

The song was promptly removed from streaming services on April 12, 2024. It was re-uploaded to streaming services on August 21, 2024.

You want some attention, it come with extensions
My dog like, "Say the word," he on bullshit, he itchin'

Your first shit was classic, your last shit was tragic
Your second shit put niggas to sleep, but they gassed it
Your third shit was massive and that was your prime
I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine
Now I'm front of the line with a comfortable lead
How ironic, soon as I got it, now he want somethin' with me
Well, he caught me at the perfect time, jump up and see
Boy, I got here off of bars, not no controversy
Funny thing about it, bitch, I don't even want the prestige
Fuck the Grammys 'cause them crackers ain't never done nothin' for me, ho
Slugs took my nigga's soul, drugs took another one
The rap beef ain't realer than the shit I seen in Cumberland
He averagin' one hard verse like every thirty months or somethin'
If he wasn't dissin', then we wouldn't be discussin' him
Lord, don't make me have to smoke this nigga 'cause I fuck with him
But push come to shove, on this mic, I will humble him
I'm Nino with this thing, this that New Jack City meme

Shoot a nigga lights out, yeah, my dogs stat fillers
Stat stuffers, triple-double, get your ass black duffled
Body bag, body bag, body bag
Cole World your instructor for Pilates class
Get a nigga stretched if I feel the disrespect, uh
Your arms might be too short to box with the god
Who live his life without the pressures of a constant facade
I pray for peace, but if a nigga cease these positive vibes
A Falcon 9 inside my pocket, bitch, this rocket gon' fly
Now it's poppin' outside like the top of July
My text flooded with the hunger for a toxic reply
I'm hesitant, I love my brother, but I'm not gonna lie
I'm powered up for real, that shit would feel like swattin' a fly
Four albums in twelve years, nigga, I can divide
Shit, if this is what you want, I'm indulgin' in violence
Put pictures in my home, aim the chrome at your eyelids
Fly pebbles at your dome, we the Stone Temple Pilots
This is merely a warning shot to back niggas down
Back in the town where they whippin' work and traffickin' pounds
My jack jumpin' 'bout a rapper makin' blasphemous sounds
Switchin' sides like the tassel on the cap and the gown
I'm fully loaded, nigga, I can drop two classics right now

Title: She’s Mine, Pt. 1
Release Date: December 9, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-shes-mine-pt-1-lyrics
Song Description: On Shes Mine Pt. 1, Cole raps from the POV of his late friend James McMillan Jr. While the narrative focuses primarily on McMillan, Cole draws inspiration from his own experiences and parallels McMillans story to his upbringing in Fayetteville. The back-and-forth voices in the outro seem to be Coles way of intertwining his and James' stories about finding love.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)

[Interlude]
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (Don't wanna die no more)
'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying, baby
I'll dry your eyes
I'll dry your eyes

[Verse]
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?

Release Date: July 22, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-t-h-e-c-l-i-m-b-b-a-c-k-lyrics
Song Description: On t h e . c l i m b . b a c k, J. Cole talks about rediscovering his love for rap and some of his traumatic life experiences.

Two days before releasing the song, Cole published an essay titled The Audacity in which he discussed several critical periods of his life and the persistent obligation to achieve his goals. He specifically utilized the word climb to describe how he advanced himself in each of these periods, which can be seen as a prelude to this song.

This and Lion King on Ice were intended to be the first two singles from Coles seventh studio album, The Fall Off. They were released together as the two-track Lewis Street.

On May 12, 2021, The Climb Back was reformatted to t h e c l i m b b a c k on streaming services. The following day, it was confirmed that it would now be included as a track on The Off-Season, instead of its original placement on The Fall Off, making it the LPs lead single. The periods werent added to the title until the albums release.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Are you doin' this work to facilitate growth or to become famous?
Which is more important?
Getting or letting go?
You can do anything, anything you can do (You can do anything)
You can do anything, anything you can do (You can do anything)

[Chorus]
Everything come back around full circle
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful?
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come-back-to-life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon

[Verse 1]
Yeah
To the left of that decimal, I need seven figures to play the joint
Turn up your decibels, peep how I decimate a joint
Check out my projects like them workers that Section 8 appoints
And you'll see how I flipped like exclamation points
My niggas shoot first as if they never played the point, more two guards
Enough straps to fill four U-Hauls
More death than World War II caused
Around these parts we pour the brown just to drown these thoughts
Of black corpses in county morgues, Lord, those images hauntin'
I ain't been asleep yet, it's ten in the mornin'
I'm sendin' a warnin', a problem with me is like the BET Hip-Hop Awards
I'm startin' to see you niggas don't want it
I'm sick of this flauntin', from niggas I know for sure ain't got mo' dough than Cole
Trash rappers, ass backwards, tryna go toe-to-toe
We laugh at ya, staff strapped up on top the totem pole to blast at ya
Bassmasters, look how they tote a pole
Gotta know the ropes and the protocol
Or they gon' for sure blow your clothes half off like a promo code
Made a lil' tune called "Foldin Clothes," and a nigga still ain't known to fold under pressure
Well, you know what Cole do
Make a diamond, they just rhymin', me, I'm quotin' gold
One phone call get you canceled like a homophobe in this PC culture
Address me as the G.O.A.T. like they call Chief Keef Sosa
In my sectional like a fuckin' three-piece sofa
I'm known as the chosen one
Another dead body lay frozen, that's how it go sometimes
When niggas weighin' coke and not the pros and cons
Well, I ain't with that sleepin' underground like a gopher, so I go for mines

My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon
Now I know why they call it blue m— (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Survival at all costs, every day, niggas get logged off
Bodies get hauled off
Passin' a funeral procession while holdin' my breath in the car, I thought
At times, it be feelin' the devil be winnin' but do that mean God lost?
Just got off the phone, my nigga, he back in the kennel, my dog lost
I brought him 'round close to me before but he
Became addicted to clout and all the hoes we'd meet
I slowly peeped jealousy on his breath whenever he spoke to me
Like on the low, he feelin' that in my shoes is where he supposed to be
I tried to ignore the signs, but they're in the back of my mind
It felt like lettin' a nigga come sleep on your couch and he eatin' up all yo' groceries
My nigga repeated this quote to me, I felt its potency
Said, "Most of these niggas gon' hang they selves, just give 'em the rope and see"
Shit, I heeded that, and what got showed to me
Was screamin' that, some niggas, you gotta leave 'em back
Unfortunately we seen the trap
Niggas be on that demon clock resultantly
They fiend to clap as often as the Genius app misquotin' me, uh
Meanwhile, I see that yo' diamonds is glistenin'
I'm glad that you shinin', but need I remind you my niggas is dimin' and nickelin'?
Scrapin' up whatever coin they can find, the pettiest crime, they committin' it
Just to get by for a limited time, the steepest of mountains, they tryin' to climb
I'm here tryna find the derivative, you niggas don't feel me
You see the clout, you don't see the real me
If I was sick, you niggas wouldn't heal me
Therefore I'm healin' myself, gettin' in tune with my God
Slowly revealin' myself, buildin' my wealth
A nigga touch mine, I'ma kill 'em myself, trust me
[Chorus]
Everything come back around full circle
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful?
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come-back-to-life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon
Now I know why they call it blue m— (Yeah)

[Outro]
Bitch, I'm back outside, nigga
I'm back outside
I'm back outside
I'm back outside
Everybody mentions suicide prevention
Man, they even made a hotline
To call up when there's tension, but I got a question
What about a fuckin' homicide?
Need a number for my niggas to call
Whenever there's a urge to get triggers involved

Title: Born Sinner
Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-born-sinner-lyrics
Song Description: This is both the title track and the last song on the standard issue of J. Coles sophomore LP, Born Sinner. In true Cole fashion, he closes the album with an emotional, cinematic beat and inspirational lyrics. The hook is delivered by James Fauntleroy II (pictured below at far right).
Lyrics:

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah
Hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I died today my nigga, was it business, was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed 'cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship, Lord, but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we'd grow to be murderers?
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless, I saw but never noticed
That a college point is right to "Be all that you can be" posters, uh
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if
This the realest shit I wrote, but know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it
And knew one day you'd come back and rewind it, singing

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it 'cause this music biz is a cliff
I got her life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming, "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you, "You the only reason why I don't flip
And go insane," my roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no
Just grow with me, go broke, you go broke with me
I smoke, you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby, you go Whitney, damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows 'em
Don't you ever go expose 'em
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show, more for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself, I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test, but where's the tutor for me?
Pops came late, I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except
[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Choir]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care

Title: Snow On Tha Bluff
Release Date: June 16, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-snow-on-tha-bluff-lyrics
Song Description: Snow On Tha Bluff is J. Coles first release of 2020. On the song, which is titled after a January 2011 film about a robbery in Atlanta, Cole delivers a single continuous verse that speaks on various issues facing the United States, including police brutality, wealth inequality, and racism. He also asks for his fans not to idolize him, wanting to instead be perceived as a regular person.

Although not explicitly stated, the first part of the track is likely a response to Nonames perceived criticisms of Cole on Twitter. She has frequently stated that she is against capitalism and celebrity culture, two things that Cole raps about in his verse.

The artwork displays the beginning of the verse. The date at the top, June 4, 2020, likely indicates the day the song was written. This date is several days after Cole was seen protesting racial injustice in his hometown, Fayetteville, NC.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Niggas be thinkin' I'm deep, intelligent, fooled by my college degree
My IQ is average, there's a young lady out there, she way smarter than me
I scrolled through her timeline in these wild times, and I started to read
She mad at these crackers, she mad at these capitalists, mad at these murder police
She mad at my niggas, she mad at our ignorance, she wear her heart on her sleeve
She mad at the celebrities, lowkey I be thinkin' she talkin' 'bout me
Now I ain't no dummy to think I'm above criticism
So when I see something that's valid, I listen
But shit, it's something about the queen tone that's botherin' me
She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment
With parents that know 'bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with
A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts 'em
And the clearest understandin' of what we gotta do to get free
And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people don't see
Just 'cause you woke and I'm not, that shit ain't no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon' lead, when you attackin' the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin'?
Instead of conveyin' you holier, come help us get up to speed
Shit, it's a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed
These shackles be lockin' the mental way more than the physical
I look at freedom like trees, can't grow a forest like overnight
Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin' your seeds
Fuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe?
I'm on some "Fuck a retweet," most people is sheep
You got all the answers but how you gon' reach?
If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say it's more effective to treat people like children
Understandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow
This change is inevitable, but ain't none of us seen this before
Therefore, we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin' just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros that's next to the commas
But look here, I promise I'm not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like, "Wait"
He was like, "Cole, 'preciate what you been doin', my nigga, that's real"
But damn, why I feel faker than Snow on tha Bluff?
Well, maybe 'cause deep down I know I ain't doin' enough

[Outro]
Can you walk with me?
I hope we'll find the reason why we often sob, go on, cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe
Though I be tryin' to let the time heal my mind
I was once a child, I've gotten older
Still, I know I'm just a boy in God's eyes
Fill me up with wisdom and some courage
Plus endurance to survive, help mine thrive106Embed

Title: In the Morning
Release Date: November 12, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-in-the-morning-lyrics
Song Description: From J Coles mixtape Friday Night Lights, produced by L&X Music, the piano-laced tune boasts hollow taps on a wood pipe and searing synths, with the Roc Nation rapper spitting about pleasing his girl. Learn more about how the collab between these two titans came about.

Originally Cole released a solo version of this song unattached to any mixtape. The first verse from here was taken from that version, which can be heard here.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Baby, you summertime fine
I let you get on top, I be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number nine, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', “Who was that?”
“Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?”
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little Patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'

Uh, baby, you wintertime cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm tryna make the goosebumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women 'cause my aunt she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm jokin', I mean that thing is pokin'
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provokin'
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, when lights comin' through the drapes and we both yawnin'
I roll over and ask if I can hit it in the mornin'

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Hey, God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the woman that can hold Patron
God bless her homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you was clear
I'm learnin' not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear
Therefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here?
Just say you're scared if you're scared
But if you through frontin', we can do somethin'
And you know just what I'm talkin' about
Tomorrow you'll be callin' out
'Cause tonight we gettin' right into the wee morn'
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way, you think about me all day
That's just a warnin'

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?

Lyrics:

[Intro]
I'm a livin' little good thing
It's like you never lived for me, yeah
Mama said you was a good thing, uh
Good, good, good, yeah
Yeah
We came a long way, man, we done came a long way
And we sittin' on top of this shit
This shit can go one of two ways
This shit can go up, it can go down
Either way, nigga, I'm prepared
Feel me? Yeah

[Verse]
I be comin' in peace, but fuck me
Best beware of the others
This shit deep, undercovers creep
This Southern heat make unbearable summers
Just last week, seen yo' mama weep
Crying 'cause she don't wan' bury your brother
The blood lеaks while the EMTs
Gotta carry her baby likе surrogate mothers
Woah, thank God we survived around where the terrorists hovered
Though traumatized, wouldn't trade it for nothin'
Through hard times, it was there I discovered
A hustle and makin' the best out the struggle
I kept grindin' 'til this day, up a level
Respect mine, gotta stay out of trouble
'Cause TEC-9s like the AR rebuttals
Cole World, niggas knowin' what it is
Just in case they don't, I show 'em what it is
This summer, I do real numbers
Couldn't dare touch it if they sold a double disc
Block hot, niggas burnin' up the street
Shots poppin' and we heard it up the street
It's a war, niggas runnin' up the score
Jesus said that you should turn the other cheek
Was his niggas gettin' murdered every week?
Dead bodies, smell the odor in the street
My homie' home, he got out on parole
He sold more Coca-Cola than the soda industry
Summertime bring the coldest winter breeze
Hella blues like the Rollin' 60s
Christ went to Heaven age thirty-three
And so did Pimp C and so did Nipsey

I told you, I told you
This shit can go up, it can go down, I don't give a fuck
Nigga, I done seen the highest heights
I done seen it twice
And I've seen the lowest of the lows
And still I rose
Now I'm at your neck, nigga, yeah241Embed

Title: Lost Ones
Release Date: September 27, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-lost-ones-lyrics
Song Description: Lost Ones is a dialogue between a young couple whove just discovered the girl is pregnant. Exploring the whirlwind of thoughts and emotion that follow this revelation, Cole adds depth to the narrative by having each verse from a different perspective; the mans, the womans, and a neutral standpoint.

In 2011, Cole cited the track as one of his favorites during a Muve Music Sessions interview:

Lost Ones, thats one of my favorite songs. Because obviously, when you listen to it, its super emotional, super deep. I feel like my favorite records of my own are my favorite because they really hit your heart or I know the impact itll have on people.

The music video, which was released October 25, 2011, featured an opening disclaimer reading:

With just a Dollar and a Dream, this video was shot in 2008 before I even had a record deal. 3 years later, watching it still give me the same emotions. This is dedicated to the Lost Ones.  Jermaine Cole

In 2014, a DJ Booth writer Kevin Taylor wrote an article about Lost Ones, admitting that it gave him the reality check of a lifetime, even going on to dub it a conscious music masterpiece. A blogger, Jane, wrote a critical analysis of the song in reply to Kevins article.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Uh-uh, uh-uh
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, yeah
Uh-uh, uh-uh
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Baby girl, I can't imagine what it's like for you
I got you pregnant, now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin' if this is gon' make me think 'bout wifin' you
Like, if you have my first child
Would I spend my whole life with you?
Now, I ain't tryna pick a fight with you, I'm tryna talk
Now, I ain't tryna spend the night with you, I'm kinda lost
See, I've been givin' it some thought lately
And frankly, I feel like we ain't ready and this—
Hold up now, let me finish!
Think about it, baby, me and you, we still kids ourself
How we gonna raise a kid by ourself?
Handle biz by ourself? A nigga barely over twenty
Where the hell we gon' live? Where am I gon' get that money?
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world
When I ain't got shit to give 'em, and I'm not with them niggas
Who be knockin' girls up and skate out
So, girl, you gotta think about how the options weigh out
What's the way out?
Uh
You might also like[Chorus]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it
[Verse 2]
She said: "Nigga, you got some nerve
To come up to me talkin' about abortion
This my body, nigga, so don't think you finna force shit!
See, I knew that this is how you act, so typical
Said you love me, oh, but now you flippin' like reciprocals
It figures though, I should've known
That you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claimin' that they love you just to get up in them drawers
Knowin' all the right things to say
I let you hit it raw, mothafucka!
Now I'm pregnant, you don't wanna get involved, mothafucka?
Tryna take away a life—is you God, mothafucka?!
I don't think so! This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife, this new life here, I'ma love it
I ain't budgin', I just do this by my mothafuckin' self
See, my mama raised me without no mothafuckin' help
From a man, but I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
'Bout your father? And you told me that you hate that nigga
Talkin' about he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
‘Cause he left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit
And here you go doin' the same shit… You ain't shit, nigga!"
[Chorus]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still, we can make it work, but you doubt it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still, we can make it work, but you doubt it
[Verse 3]
They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons, then grow apart
She wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
Now she wide open
She'd put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her ‘cause the pussy good
But she ain't no wife though
Uh-oh! She tellin' him she missed her period, like typos
He panickin', froze up like a mannequin, a life grows
Inside her, and now he askin': "Is it even mine?"
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant? Dog, could she be lyin'?
And she be cryin', ‘cause he actin' distant
Like, "Ever since I told you this, nigga, you actin' different."
And all his niggas sayin', "Man, these hoes be trappin' niggas
Playin' with niggas' emotions like they some action figures."
Swear they get pregnant for collateral, it's like extortion
Man, if that bitch really pregnant, tell her to get a abortion (Uh)
But what about your seed, nigga? (Uh-uh)
But what about your seed, nigga?
But what about your seed, nigga?
But what about your seed, nigga?
[Outro]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it135Embed

Title: ​everybody dies
Release Date: December 2, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-everybody-dies-lyrics
Song Description: Everybody Dies had been released on the Behind-the-Scenes documentary, Eyez that was exclusively released on Tidal. The interlude targets other members of the rap community, rappers that some would call mumble rappers.

Cole does not like the direction that hip hop is moving. There are many suspects as to who may have been the main target here, rappers such as Lil Yachty, Lil Uzi Vert, and 21 Savage.

It has been documented that J. Cole and Lil Yachty have had a little bit of history together. Back in 2011, Lil Yachty had tweeted, Fuck J. Cole, before blowing up a couple years later.

This J. Cole produced beat samples Minnie Ripertons Inside My Love. It should be noted that 2Pac also utilized this sample in the same way on his song Me Against the World. Its safe to assume Cole chose the sample for that very reason, especially with the Pac-influenced-title of 4 Your Eyez Only, which was released shortly after this single was. The drums were also sampled from Dexter Wansels Theme From the Planets.

According to his interview with Angie Martinez, this song was originally meant to be a part of his upcoming 6th studio album, The Fall Off.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, we back
Back in Mohammad crib, nigga, top floor
The back room with just the one little small window, nigga
The light be comin' through it in the morning
Old-ass walls and shit
But it's just like I remember, just like I wanted it
Yeah, I'm workin'
Yeah, I'm workin', nigga

[Verse]
Look, it's the return of the Mr. Burn Suckers
Not herpes infested, just perfectly blessed with
A style that you can't F with, protection recommended
‘Cause Cole the definition of a weapon that can end it
You know, mass destruction when I mash the button
I take your favorite major rapper, left him independent
Cryin' in the corner
‘Cause I ain't into sorta kinda, dissin' niggas
I'm borderline addicted to slaughter
Line up niggas in order
Of who you think can really fuck with me most
Then I tuck the heat close, if he don't duck then he ghost
Ain't no need for discussion
If they weren't talkin' 'bout the bread these motherfuckers be toast
Clap at the fake deep rappers
The OG gatekeep rappers
The would-you-take-a-break-please rappers
Bunch of words and ain't sayin' shit, I hate these rappers
Especially the amateur eight week rappers
Lil' whatever – just another short bus rapper
Fake drug dealers turn tour bus trappers
Napoleon complex, you this tall rappers
Get exposed standin' next to 6'4" rappers
The streets don't fuck with you, you Pitchfork rappers
Chosen by the white man, you hit store rappers
I reload the clip, then I hit more rappers with that
Straight shittin' on these piss-poor rappers, I'm back
Never knew a nigga that was better
Revenue, I'm good at gettin' cheddar
Reminisce on days I didn't eat
If it's meant to be, then it'll be
If it's not, then fuck it, I'ma try
Ain't no need to ask the Father why, no
‘Cause one day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, oh
One day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, my nigga, my niggaYou might also like102Embed

Bada-ba, da-da
Off-Season
Let's work, hey

[Chorus]
Plottin' my escape, this game rotten, niggas fake
Got a couple M's hidin' in the safe
Imagination turned a Honda into Wraith
I was doin' eighty on the interstate
Tryna make it back before my class started
Country nigga never seen a passport
'Til I popped off and got a bag for it
Now I'm at the Garden sittin' half court
Watchin' Jr. catch it off the backboard
'Ville nigga never seen nothing
'Cept a fucking triple beam jumping
Good dope leave a fiend krumping
Made it out, it gotta mean something

[Verse]
Either you gon' hustle or that nigga Uncle Sam got yo' ass re-enlisting
2-6, murder scene pumping
Better leave it tucked if you ain't dumping
Pow, pow, nigga, he slumping
Twelve comin', we ain't seen nothing
Time change, niggas ain't rumbling no more
Nah, what for? Hungry for more
If you solo these vocals, listen close and you can hear grumbling
Multi' and I'm still munching
Big bag, never fear fumbling
Want smoke? Nigga don't choke
I'm a whole fuckin' nicotine company
Dreamville the Army, not a Navy
How could you ever try to play me?
Kill 'em on a song, walk up out the booth
Do the Westbrook rock-a-baby
I never fall out with the bro
Hate when your family turn into foe
We had a penthouse on the road
Interior decorated with the hoes
Just like a multiple-choice getting chose
My niggas like, "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe"
Scoop up a dime-piece like we homeless
Then we gon' send 'em back pigeon-toed
Out of the concrete was a rose, them winters was cold
Had to go over and stand by the stove
We from the Southeast, niggas know
This where the opps creep real slow
Won't vote but they mob deep with the poles
I punch the time sheet, not no more
'Cause now my assigned seat is the throne

Title: LAnd of the Snakes
Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-land-of-the-snakes-lyrics
Song Description: LAnd of the Snakes depicts Coles promiscuous affairs with women, something he enjoys in the choruses but regrets in the third verse, when he runs into a woman he once had a one night stand with and realizes that it hurt her. He is referring to himself as having once been (and possibly still being) a snake for hitting it and quitting it.

The stylization of the title (LAnd instead of Land) is purposefully done to highlight the location of where he ran into the old female in the third verse.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Lord, know some hoes from the past
Like, "Damn Cole, wish I knew that you would be rich"
Well, shoulda asked
It's funny how these niggas on some real "be cool with me" shit
I bag two bitches like it's two of me, bitch
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Finally got my own bedroom in this bitch
No more sleeping in my brother room
Like, "Man, I might as well be sleeping in my mother room"
'Cause how I'm supposed to sneak hoes with my bro here?
Plus she gon' find out I been rocking all his old gear
This his flow here, this is no fair, this is so pure
This is so clear, this is one breath, this is no air
Ain't no wedding but I do the most here
I'm the President, you the co-chair
You the player, yeah, I'm the coach here, nigga, I coast here
This weather got me set up on this West Coast, yeah
Avoidin' the snakes, AKs, and coke, yeah
Get my dick wet, but I never let it soak there
Man, I been thinkin' 'bout movin' out
What? Country boy in the city
Of New York nine years, ran that shit like Diddy
Riding through South Side Queens like Fiddy
You might also like[Chorus]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Awww baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You 'bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop, drop)

[Verse 2]
Now if you only had one wish is it devious?
'Cause you already know who your genie is
Ain't get a cover now your mag on my penis
Like damn, he turned out to be a genius
Damn, real shit nigga, no Pixar
You niggas soft like Meagan Good's lips are
My kicks hard, my whip hard
I came out the womb with my dick hard
Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard
It'd be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard
Don't get exposed to these hoes boy, knock it off
I seen your mama in the Benz when she dropped you off
Damn, now who more thorough than me?
I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see
Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see
Gotta ask myself, "What mean the world to me?"
Me, me
[Chorus]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Aw baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)

This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street wit'
Yeah
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street wit'
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah, back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush, but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her 'cause see I tried to hit
On the first night, and nah, I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it, huh
And I never called back, how thoughtfulless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist, nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit, my prerogative, nigga
Is to hit and never commit
Not realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call, she was hurtin'
Now she's staring dead in my face, she was smirking
Like, "Yeah, I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga"

Hm, this the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with96Embed

Lyrics:

[Intro: Cam'ron & J. Cole]
Killa, it's The Off-Season
Let's keep it tall, y'all ain't fuckin' with my man
And don't check your watch, you know the time
Cole World, Killa Cam', niggas is fuckin' finished (Yeah)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
This shit too easy for me now
Nigga, Cole been goin' plat' since back when CDs was around
What you sold, I tripled that, I can't believe these fuckin' clowns
Look how everybody clappin' when your thirty-song album do a measly hundred thou'
If I'm bettin' on myself, then I completely double down
If you hated on a nigga, please don't greet me with a pound
I be stayin' out the way, but if the beef do come around
Could put a M right on your head, you Luigi brother now
Trace my steps all in this game, you could see we cover ground
Back and forth from NC to New York when Jeezy had the crown
Vivid memories, niggas start to squeeze, we duckin' down
So many shells left on the ground, it make the Easter Bunny proud
I get up, dust my clothes off, sleep is the cousin of death
No plans to doze off, the streets, it don't come with a ref'
I never sold soft, just creeped where the hustlers crept
And got they O's off, you reach, niggas uppin' like Steph
To blow your nose off, gesundheit, and then resume flight
As if it never happened, shit we witnessed full of so much sickness
Angels sheddin' tears in Heaven, word to Eric Clapton
Off this clever rappin', bitch, my pockets gon' forever fatten

Creepin' on ya, the scent of failure reekin' on ya
Check your genitalia, pussy-niggas bleedin' on yourself
Fuckin' with Cole is bold, but it's impedin' on your health
All yo' niggas eatin' off your wealth
All my niggas feedin' all they selves, and it feels swell
Krispy Kreme dreams, sometime my dawgs wanna kill 12 (Uh)
'Cause they steady harassin'
We seen dilemmas like Nelly and Kelly that end in the deadliest fashion
My young niggas nutty, they blastin'
Bullets be hummin' like Cudi, put one in yo' hoodie, Spaghetti-O splashin'
All over the driveway, y'all talkin' all sideways
Shots poppin' off, y'all laid down
Cops chalkin' off y'all legs now

My niggas looked up to the sky like we sendin' 'em y'all way (Y'all way)
We sendin' 'em y'all way (Y'all way)

Title: Runaway
Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-runaway-lyrics
Song Description: On the lush Runaway, Cole talks about his relationship troubles, which, underneath the moral struggles and spiritual dichotomies hinted at by the album title, is another topic he goes back to throughout the record.  Hes trying to be good to his girl but isnt succeeding: You dont wanna let her down but youre too young for the settle down. But the topics soon expand: a pervy high school coach, how rape during slavery led to his grandmothers light complexion. The drama builds musically as well, with breakbeats and subtle Rhodes chords giving way to strings, electric guitars and a bass solo.

Lyrics:

[Intro: Mike Epps (Sampled)]
Married men act totally different when they're by themselves, don't they? You see 'em with their wife, "What's up Tony?" "Hey man, how's everything going brother? Oh, just taking it easy, hanging out with the old lady. Alright, God bless you, take it easy now, alright." You be like that nigga ain't like that
You see him by himself, "What's up Tony?" "Hey, where's the bitches at, nigga?! Where's the bitches?!"

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Gimme my space, Lord, ain't enough time to chase
All these dreams, nah mean? I got no time to wait
Love my girl, but I told her straight up, "Don't wait up"
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked and made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feelin' like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wan' be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She'll never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowin' when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wan' let her down
But you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Aw shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying, "Baby, won't you throw them bands on me?"
And I came to spend
She pop a molly, let the motherfuckin' games begin
I'm running away

[Verse 2]
When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher say we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: "Are you sure?
Even a murderer? Even a whore?
Even a nigga running through bitches on tour
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit?"
She losin' faith in him and he knows the shit, like, "What the fuck is a break?
Don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got 'til it ain't no more
No more tears, it's been ten long years
Damn near, I don't know if I can wait no more"
And who can blame her, you complain about
Every time you out, you come back she poutin'
Sleeping back to back, this is wack, we 'bout
To go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of your guilt and she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evenin'
And even in your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman, at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you

Unbelievable, seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age three I knew this world was three below
Listen, even though my ego low, achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me, "Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color they face is"
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, 'cause you
Know your wifey loves you, thus you refuse to accept it
That’s the type of shit that turned my granny light-skinned
Rich white men rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains concealed
In our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from fifty-mill like Dave Chappelle?
You know

Song Description: On Sparks Will Fly, Cole describes how his newfound fame has put strain on his relationship. It marks the first collaboration between Cole and Jhen Aiko.

Sparks Will Fly was included as the final bonus track on the deluxe version of Coles second studio album, Born Sinner, which serves as the third instalment of his Truly Yours series, as confirmed by Cole on Twitter.
Lyrics:

[Produced by Christian Rich]

[Hook: Jhené Aiko and  J. Cole]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Baby you deserve the whole enchilada
Gucci and Prada
Toast to the days when I didn't have a dollar
You stuck around even when the world frowned on me
Kicked me when I was down, and so they clowned on me
Down for me, my homie
You better believe, I know your home girl said you should leave a note
Know you was tired like the Michelin man
What if Gina would have listened to Pam?
Now they hate to see us last this long
When they get my album, probably pass this song
Thought they knew me well
Money can't buy you happiness that's true as hell
But happiness can't buy yo' ass this new SL
I love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit
I love you like the bad kid love breakin' shit
Ride or die chick, fighting insecurities
Want a ring and my last name for securities

Nigga ain't perfect, it's true
Funny though I am perfect for you
All the drama seem worth it for you
She put up with the shit like she work at the zoo, true
Now what you crying for?
She says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for?
She want that old thing back
Things ain't the same, think we both seen that
Love is war, end up on the floor
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back
I say those words hoping that
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you
Like I fight temptations every night for you
And know I slip, only girl in my life is you

[Intro: J. Cole]
Cole World
Southside
Can't get enough, can't get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Now, I ain't got no kids yet, but this right here's for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet, but that's how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter, pro'bly make a gay nigga reconsider
You're now rockin' with the best, mane, dress game down to the sex game
Won't brag, but the boy been blessed, mane, let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she's fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl, 'cause a nigga don't play them ex games
Nope, straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain't coming off of my last name, 'cause I really can't take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit, your homegirl saying, "He a bad boy"
But I'm signed to the Roc, no time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
She said
"I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got I need a lot, so I can't let you go"

Try to let go, but I just cannot, so don't you stop, I need that"

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter, even way out in London town
Hoes holla, 'cause they love my sound and I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that'll cut all night, that'll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight, tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight, on the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head, I hate it when you give me headaches

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
She said
"I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes

Hey, Cole World, baby, ain't nothin' sunny, I see 'em hating, but it ain't nuttin' to me
I'm from the Ville where they bang for the money and carry fo'-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred? Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let's make a track, I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right thurr

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time

For you I drop the tough guy shit, on this bus I sit

Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Damn it feel good to have you

[Verse 1]
Needin' me, wantin' me, givin' me a chance to feel special
To somebody in a world where they not lovin' me
Handcuffs keep huggin' the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
'Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin' because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin' on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here
What's that smell? Where's your diaper shit here?
Lay on your back, don't pee right now
Or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I ain't never did nothing this right in my whole life
Got me thinking...

Title: FRIENDS
Release Date: April 20, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-friends-lyrics
Song Description: Although there is a feature on FRIENDS, it is speculated to be Cole himself in the form of an alter-ego. This is integral in understanding the yin-yang theme in play.

Edward is the victim of drug addiction and abuse. He is evidence of how controlling and overtaking these substances can become. J. Cole is contrasting him when he discusses the reasons why drugs are such a problem. It could be the type of drugs, the political climate of the United States, the users environment, or the influence of music itself.

However, the reasoning for why drugs are so problematic is more complicated as Cole attempts to break down. It comes down to many factors such as upbringing, mental health issues, historical trauma and other causes. According to him, the roots of many of these addictions come from atrocities experienced during childhood. All in all, Cole is emphasizing that the battles fought by victims of substance abuse are caused by deeper, darker reasons. Their reliance on drugs is deeper than the surface; to them, it is internally straining.

He wants individuals, including his own friends, to feel comfortable with themselves again. He knows if they can find a way to get out of the hole that drugs have dug, they can find their true identity again.

Cole suggests that drugs can be avoided with healthier substitutions, in particular, meditation. Meditation can provide means of mindfulness and positivity as an alternative to drug abuse and medication.

And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got 12 slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate
[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate

Six head shots, I’ll erode a nigga
Pop another clip and I'm reloaded nigga
Ain’t no way around it, I’m the coldest nigga
Do a nigga dirty life's a coal, my nigga
Get you cleaned up then I fold you nigga
Shout out to the haters who promote a nigga
Flow hot, whip cold, I’m bipolar nigga
But I don’t like to talk about a Rover nigga
Keep this shit a hundred, I just sold it nigga
Tired of police looking at me like I stole it nigga
Probably just gonna cop a lil Corolla nigga
Don’t need a rollie on to know I’m getting older nigga
Dreamville going way up like a floater nigga
Couple hands out like I owe them niggas
Where was you when the Civic was getting towed my nigga?
No snakes in the grass cause I mowed it nigga

[Verse 2]
Cole world you should stay off this dick
I sold out the Garden, I should play for the Knicks
Took a couple minutes and I sold out Staples
A nigga getting cream like an old ass Laker
But I ain’t coming to talk about all that paper
That’s what they talk about when they ain’t got shit to say
Can’t understand why niggas never got shit to do
You know the saying, same shit nigga, different day
I never felt that, no way
Cause on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish and chips
Why I do a lot of shows? I’m the shit, that’s it
Got suicidal doors, I just slit my wrists
Never stingy with the hoes word to Cliff and Chris
So if I fuck six bitches I got six assists nigga
The flow sick as shit, catch ebola if you bit this shit
I never take, I invent the shit then flip the shit
Then lick the shit, and bit the shit back twice, I’m that nice, woo
What’s the plan?
Cole keeps snapping like a Mustard jam
Got a middle finger for Uncle Sam
I done paid so much taxes I can fund Japan
But instead they make a young nigga fund the man
Same man that keep a young nigga under, damn
I just cocked back nigga and my gun don’t jam
On a scale from one to ten I’m a hundred grand
[Outro]
It's Cole fuckin’ world nigga
Dreamville in this motherfucker, Top Dawg in this motherfucker
"When you and K. Dot shit drop?"
Bitch never, they can’t handle two Black niggas this clever
But this February, bet shit get scary when I fuck around and drop...

Title: The Cut Off
Release Date: April 20, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-the-cut-off-lyrics
Song Description: The Cut Off appropriately named, talks about Cole having to cut people off who were close to him due to lack of trust and being taken advantage of. He realized that he was giving a lot of himself to others and not getting enough in return.

He also expresses his desire to retaliate, but reminds himself that revenge is the Lords work.

It is crucial to emphasize the opposing character that kILL Edward represents. J. Cole is advocating against drugs because of the experiences he has seen of those who use substances around him. He knows the toll that substance abuse can take on individuals  Edward is a quintessential example of an addict who is manipulated by the drugs that he is using. Cole wishes to be helpful and prevent the possibility for further victims in his community, as well as at a larger scale in society  he doesnt want to see anyone else like Edward.

So I'ma see you when I see you, know that day comin'
I pray that on that day you slip and say something
I never fantasize 'bout murder 'cause I'm still sane
But I can't seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
I know that vengeance is the Lord's and it's not for me
I know the punishment for you is that you not with me
You place your value on the bitches that you got with me
And now the bitches ask you daily "Why you not with me?"
I had to cut some people off 'cause they was using me
My heart is big, I want to give too much and usually
I send the bread and don't hear back for like two months now
You hit my phone, you need a loan, oh I'm a crutch now
I had to learn, I never had shit
You never would split, you was hood rich
I couldn't get a dollar from you I remember that
It was blurry for a while but now it's coming back (coming back)

Title: Trouble
Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-trouble-lyrics
Song Description: The song was one of the more darker cuts on the album. Featuring the powerful vocals of a choir throughout the song, this continuation of the albums religious theme gave the track a Church-like feel to it.

Cole addresses temptation and lust in this song, again a continuation of the seven deadly sins theme of the album.

Although the song wasnt released as a single, designer Mario Hugo who worked with Cole for the artwork on the entire project produced this sleeve for the song.



You can find out more about Hugos collaboration with Cole on the albums cover art here.
Lyrics:

[Refrain]
(I said) Set it off on my left, set it off on my right
(I said) Liquor all on my breath, bitches all in my sight
(I said) Real niggas tryna fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
(I said) Gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life
(I said)

[Bridge]
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
Troubles of this, troubles of this world

[Verse 1]
Yeah, god flow
Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso
Niggas say "Live fast, die young," so I drive slow
And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go
I ain't fuck her, but I'm thinking 'bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it
Ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first is sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on Twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard "Can't Get Enough"
Now she fuck a nigga thinking that she may have hit the lotto
No way, Jose
Could write a book called, "The Things Hoes Say"
Show a lot of love to my sisters though
But these bitches so predictable
I'm in trouble

[Verse 2]
And I'm going back to school
Only for the hoes and a class or two
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
Everybody sweat her like Catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off her test and I'm grabbing her ass
She like "Don't you know this shit already?"
"Nigga, ain't you rich already?"
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
Hanging 'round these rappers 'cause they dumb as shit
But I'm back on track, jump shot wasn't that good
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
That's one stereotype
Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type
No saving hoes
I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And they mans don't know, they mans don't know, fo' sho
Had a nigga baby, little mans don’t know
Mama, was a freak, got it in on the low
12 years later when my song come on, he ask
"Mama, did you fuck J. Cole?"
Whoa
[Chorus]
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
Getting to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
I take it to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man

Set it off on my left, set it off on my right

Title: For Whom the Bell Tolls
Release Date: December 9, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-for-whom-the-bell-tolls-lyrics
Song Description: As Cole did with his previous album, 2014 Forest Hill Drive, he begins 4 Your Eyez Only with a melodic, slow-jammed introduction. Unlike Intro, though, For Whom The Bell Tolls touches on feelings of hopelessness and having nowhere to go. At one point, James (whos perspective this albums story is told from) even contemplates suicide: Aint no way to live, do I wanna die?

The title references Ernest Hemingways 1940 novel For Whom the Bell Tolls. It tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American engaged in guerrilla warfare during the Spanish Civil War. As a dynamiter, he is assigned to blow up a bridge during an attack. The novel centers on the idea of death and suicide, both of which James explores in these lyrics"I have no one, Im lonely, my bridges have burnt down."

Hemingway got the title from Meditation XVII, a 1642 poem by metaphysical poet John Donne. The line he quotes from reads: And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I see the, I see the—
I see the, I see the—
I see the rain
Pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise
I see the, I see the rain
Pouring down, uh
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise

[Verse]
I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming
Lord, huh
Lord, huh
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down
Lord
Lord

[Chorus]
The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know

Title: Motiv8
Release Date: April 20, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-motiv8-lyrics
Song Description: Motiv8  read Motivate  is about the motivation to get money. Get money happens to be the catchphrase of the song, repeated in the chorus as well as sampled from the Junior M.A.F.I.A. song Get Money from 1995.

As the sixth track from J. Coles album, KOD, it comes as the beginning of the turning point away from J. Coles alter-ego, King Overdosed. Its easily the most zany, drugged out song on the album. This was done on purpose to represent the peak of being high. After this track, Cole begins to come down with more chilled out, lo-fi beats that involve introspective on why he and others resort to drugs to solve problems. This is his sober self, trying to come up with solutions to his lifes problems other than drugs.

The song was first heard at Coles April 16th, 2018 listening party and posted to YouTube later that night.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
You really wanna know who Superman is?
Watch this, pow!
I like him
I think he's pretty cool
He's my idol

[Verse 1]
I can't have no sympathy for fuck niggas
All this shit I've seen done made my blood thicker
Spill promethazine inside a double cup
Double up my cream, now that's a Double Stuff, yeah
Please don't hit my phone if it ain't 'bout no commas
Keep the peace like Dalai Lama, big body Hummers
Backin' out the parkin' spot and though the law be on him
He exempt, Shawn Kemp, he keep that .40 on him
Go!

Title: BRACKETS
Release Date: April 20, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-brackets-lyrics
Song Description: On BRACKETS Cole details his journey climbing up the tax brackets, describing how taxpayers should have more agency in how their money is being spent in the 21st Century. Cole uses this to also focus on underprivileged communities of color who are ignored by leaders theyve never seen.

Ending the song remarking a mother who has two sons one who was doing well in school the other who was a misfit. Although the mother was only able to pay for one kid to get into a private school and she may have lived in a good area, her tax bracket will be defined by her environment and not what was going on in her life.

BRACKETS was also released three days after National Tax Day.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Richard Pryor]
Lotta shit happens, like, being in show business
A lot of shit happens, like, like, I make a lot of money, you know
And I'm really happy about it
And I'm not bragging, I just wanna say something
I make a so—fuck, it's ridiculous
But wait, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hey, if my father was alive today, I would go home and say
"Dad, I wanna tell you how much money I made"
You know what he'd say? "You's a lying motherfucker
Joe Louis didn't make that much money
Come in here, get your ass out the house
Coming here with that bullshit," hah

[Verse 1]
Niggas hating on me, I ain't used to that
Know a couple people wanna shoot for that
I say "No, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that"
Them niggas tryna blow and ain't need me for that
And if it work for them, well shit, I'm cool with that
'Cause how they feel, I ain't got shit to do with that
I just sit back on cool and watch my paper stack
And trip off how much bread them crackers take from that
[Chorus]
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void

[Interlude]
Hell yeah boy, I'm a goddamn millionaire now
Hell yeah, nigga, they can't tell me shit now, bro, hell no, fuck that
Bitch, got my first motherfuckin' million dollar check nigga
I'm goddamn lit boy, you crazy as hell
Hold up, it's my phone real quick, it's my Unc'
Uncle Sam and shit
"What's up Unc'? Yup. Hey, I told you that check was coming in, I gotchu when it came in. Goddamn, I'm a man of my word. Goddamn, I told you I'ma have it, and goddamn, I'ma have it for you. Hell, shit, damn right. Now, how much was it though? Uh huh. Huh? Half? Half nigga? You crazy, boy, you crazy. Bitch, you crazy as fuck. Bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced
I guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
But my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send
Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend
Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
One thing about the men that's controlling the pen
That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
Maybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again
I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim
Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
Some older nigga told me to start votin'
I said "Democracy is too fuckin' slow"
If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know
Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
She can't take this shit no more, she want him out
On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn
[Chorus]
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Title: Window Pain (Outro)
Release Date: April 20, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-window-pain-outro-lyrics
Song Description: This song starts with a narrative of a little girl who discusses the story of her cousin getting shot.

For the duration of this song, Cole is self-reflective and contemplative as he discusses the things he truly wishes for in life. He wants to help and care for people around him, namely his family, and he wants to finally be able to celebrate his own success after all hes been through.

Despite his own troubles, Cole understands how fortunate he is and he is very grateful for what his life has given him. He is aware that so many others, including friends of his, havent been as lucky and have endured tragedies.

In the conclusion of this outro track, Cole asks the child why he thinks that bad things happen. The young boy has an intelligent answer in saying that he believes God is teaching humanity a lesson in preparation for a rejuvenation of the world as it is. Once society has a sufficient comprehension of evil, the boy claims that the world will restart itself due to Gods power. This new reality will be more peaceful, calm, pure and utopian.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
One night
When me and my mom was about to go to bed
All the doors was locked
Then when I had fell asleep
My mom had heard three gun shots
It was to my cousin, his name was Rod
The one that came to pick me up
He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck
And he got shot right in the stomach

[Chorus]
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane?
Have I sacrificed for fame?
My occupation's on my brain
Thought that I could change it all if I had change
But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same
I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came
They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing
It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range
Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange
How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing?
I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin'
That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head
Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead
Shootin' up where his granny live, "blaow, blaow!", his granny duck
He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny'd up
Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up?
He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough
Just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways
The results are deadly
Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me
The little girl I met this past summer said, "Don't forget me"
I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through?
A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you
And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue?
If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through
I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through
[Chorus]
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
[Outro]
It's not that big
Well at least, um
God had saved him 'cause he still alive
So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen?
Like why can't the world just be all nice things?
Because God is tryna, um
Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn
Or He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world
He's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and for us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time
And after we do that, He's gonna restart the world
K.O.D
Choose wisely!

The strangest feeling but I can't be sure
Something that's old as forever

Title: Hello
Release Date: December 9, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-hello-lyrics
Song Description: With Coles lack of a love life mentioned in the previous song, he decides to call up an old flame to see if they can re-kindle what they had, only to find out she started a new life.

Throughout the song Cole tries to reach her over the phone, (hence the repetition of hello), while contemplating how he could have changed his life with her.

Note: Its possible Cole is talking about the same girl he did on Games Pray given the details in both tracks.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

[Verse 1]
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes two now
Oh what do I do now?
'Cause if we ever got together
I'd have to be them niggas step-pops forever
And well that ain't my thing 'cause I
I ain't even got my own
And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about that little kid
And I thought about the things we did
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
I don't wanna wait forever

Hello? Hell-hello? Hello?
Shit seem so sad when you look back (Hello?)
Shit seem so sad when you look back (Hello?)
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Everything's so sad when you look back

[Verse 2]
On the rebound like a book back
On the rebound like a put back
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick, don't it?
Reflection bring regrets don't it?
Rejection makes you defensive
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end
[Bridge 2]
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good, ay

It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
Heh, it's all good

[Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes two now

Title: Lights Please
Release Date: June 15, 2009, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-lights-please-lyrics
Song Description: J. Coles ode to ignorant women and the ills of the world from his second mixtape, The Warm Up, lays some pretty heavy sentiment over a sparse but engaging beat.

Some have speculated the girl can also represent hip-hop (a la Common), and J. Cole validated this interpretation in a 2013 interview.

The song is what led to Cole being the first rapper signed to Jay-Zs Roc Nation label. Via HiphopDX:

Thats the song that got me so many meetings in the industry. It got me my meeting with Mark Pitts. Mark Pitts played it for Jay-Z. Jay-Z heard that song and thats the reason why he even wanted to see me was from hearing Lights Please.'

The song was later re-released on Coles debut album, Cole World: The Sideline Story in 2011.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Ugh, yeah, yeah, ugh

[Verse 1]
I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin' like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like, "Baby, look at how we live broke on the boulevard"
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo'
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo'
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin'
You feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit
And naw, that ain't your girl, dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights, please
You might also like[Chorus]
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceilin'
She say she wanna blow L's, I hear her and I'm willin'
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke, well, I'm tryna put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been livin' a lie
And that they love to see us all go to prison or die
Like, "Baby, look at how they show us on the TV screen"
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it, she workin', jerkin' it nonstop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip, I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin', the more I grow
The more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules, but yet y'all tryna play the game
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make?
Coward nigga, you a fake
How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back
Then go start another family?
Dawg, what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recordin' tracks
Said "I know you wanna change the world
But for the night, please
Just reach over and hit the lights please"
[Chorus]
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, turn off the lights
Lights, please

[Outro]
Alright, if y'all niggas heard the first one, The Come Up and shit, then you would have heard part 1 of this joint right here. It's "Dead Presidents", you know classic nigga, that's classic Jay shit. So I did it, threw it on the first mixtape, this is about a year ago. We let niggas hear like you know the mixtape whatever, and there was always this one nigga that stuck out to me like a year ago. This nigga's like "yo". like I thought I did my thing on this shit, that was like two of my favorite verses that I did, but he was just like "Yo", like, "Yo you didn't come right man. If you gon' come on Dead Presidents son, you gotta come, hard son, you gotta come harder than that son, you gotta come harder than that." I was like, man what you mean I came hard? But, that shit always stuck in my mind, so doing this next, you know, doing this The Warm Up I was like, damn, I gotta get on it again, I gotta do it again. Just almost like, just to prove to that nigga and kinda prove to myself that you I can, I can maybe get a little...

Title: Cole Summer
Release Date: April 30, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-cole-summer-lyrics
Song Description: A single released prior to his sophomore album Born Sinner. J Cole announced that it wouldnt appear on the album, but he felt that he needed to give his fans something, an occurrence that fortunately for fans, he makes happen often.

Sampling Lauryn Hills Nothing Even Matters (feat. D'Angelo), Cole speaks on a variety of topics in a reflection of his road travelled thus far. The song culminates into a conversation between Jermaine and hip-hop personified.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
It's only what you got in the form of the highest power you seek
Now this right here's not a preview
I need to let it go
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Now this right here is not a preview
Of what the album gon' bring you, or nuttin' like that
Sharing things I think quietly, with those that admire me
'Member MTV Diary? This something like that
I wear my heart up on my sleeve and I bleed for you
Cookin' beats hoping to reach like each one you
When I release, trust if you feel like my shit is weak
When you see me on the street, then speak, I refund you
This sample was yellin' "loop me!"
Ms. Hill, please don't sue me
'Cause I ain't one of these rappers out here frontin' like he got it, nigga
I ain't fuckin' got it, nigga...
Throwing thousands in the strip club with Drizzy
Difference is I'm throwing four, he throwin' 50
Lord, forgive me, bitches saying, "You a rapper nigga, ain't you s'posed to tip more?"
I don't see no pussy, baby, ain't you s'posed to strip more?
Confessions of a cheap-ass nigga
But I finally put my momma in that E-Class, nigga
And I told her quit her job but hold your horses
If my next album flop it's back to the post office, both of us, shit
They saying that's a real possibility
The thought alone is killing me
You might also like[Chorus 1]
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go, uh
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
I think I need to let it go
'Cause nothing even matters...

[Verse 2]
Anticipating rain, I can't make the same mistakes again
Them '90s niggas raped the game
And left us with a battered and bruised bitch with a few kids
The pussy loose but the truth is I love her, though
She ain't perfect, but who is?
Hoes saying "Cole, you is" don't be silly, ma, 'cause really I
Just a born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Cole summer, I predict another winter
'Cause I'm fin' ta drop knowledge like a Five Percenter
Fuck the Bilderberg, nigga show 'em God sent ya
Rhyme with the skill, as if Nas went to
College on scholarship met Pac and said "I'm down witcha"
And when they wasn't writin' rhymes they fuckin' line sisters
Puffin' on swishers, what's up Milan?
Every time I drop I get the net poppin' like LeBron swishes
Kay told me kill ya, and I gotta respect my mom's wishes
When I let go this how my mind switches
No looking back, don't even want to see my prom pictures
Pardon the rhyme scheme, I guess I'm long-winded
Let me switch it now, back to Hell's Kitchen now
Up in Hova office like he the fucking principal
Put me in with StarGate, that shit was like detention now
Just tellin' my story so dissin' ain't my intention now
Drop a couple hits and all the dummies pay attention now
A shame when you learn the ins and outs of the game
And reminisce on little Jermaine in the south
Rappin' out loud with all the niggas that's cool to you
Just to realize that all them niggas was foolin' you
And they ain't who they said they were
Talk about the streets but nigga, that ain't really where they were, actin' just like Dede was
But who am I to judge? That's neither here nor there
Just know I know, my nigga, I just like being aware
If I had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamera
At the same time and put name tags on they titties
So I don’t get they names wrong, screamin' "Game on"
Like Wayne's World, that just came on
I'm rambling now, five days to finish the album, I'm scramblin' now
Took a break from samplin' now
Just to say a few words to this bitch named Summer
June'll make four years since I gave you my number
The Warm Up dropped, I got hot, you called it a classic
And Jay dropped "Autotune", you wanted him back, shit
Play my position, the whole while still wishin'
A year later Drake put his key in your ignition
And I told my fellas I dropped Friday Night Lights
In the winter just to make her jealous
Wanted to drop the album in the summer, but the label didn't think that they could sell it
Recoup the first week, I think it ain't shit they can tell us
Do you agree?
It's been a long time coming this thing between you and me
[Chorus 2]
I can't let it go
I can't let it go, nah
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
They say I need to let it go
'Cause nothing even matters, ayy

[Outro]
Yeah

Title: Ville Mentality
Release Date: December 8, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-ville-mentality-lyrics
Song Description: Ville Mentality focuses on the perils of fame that Cole has experienced. He reiterates his feelings about choosing an early retirement from the rap game.

Cole originally used the term ville mentality on his 2013 song Can I Holla At Ya. He also brought up the term Fayetteville mentality in his documentary 2014 Forest Hills Drive: Homecoming, describing it as the belief that opportunity was not present in his small town.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now

[Verse]
Trials and tribulations I'm facing
In this age of information, I hate this shit
'Cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
Bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
You call it runnin', I call it escapin'
Start a new life in a foreign location
Similar to my niggas duckin' cases
Can't take the possible time that he faces

[Chorus]
How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now

My dad, he died—he got shot 'cause his friend set him up. And I didn't go to his funeral—and sometimes when I'm in my room, I get mad at my momma when she mean to me. And she—

[Bridge]
Nigga play me, never, give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never, show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never
Nigga play me, never, give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never, show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never

[Chorus]
How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now
[Outro]
I get mad and I slam my door and go in my room—
And then, I get mad and I say, "I wish my dad was here"

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 1]
I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I, I see a lot on your plate
Nine months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you

I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 2]
Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice in being present
There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you
Except right here with you
Folding clothes
Watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows
Eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl
With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day
I'm drinking almond milk
("You soft!")
[Chorus]
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Bridge]
If I can make life easier
The way you do mine
Save you some time
Alleviate a bit of stress from your mind
Help you relax
Let you recline babe
Then I should do it
'Cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
That say "I love you"
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
[Verse 3]
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
"Damn, what's gotten into you?"
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peeking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright51Embed

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I put my heart and soul in this game, I'm feelin' drained
Unappreciated, unalleviated
Tired of comin' up short—fuck abbreviated
Want my whole name spelt out, my own pain spilt out
No pain, no gain, I blow brains—Cobain
Throw flames, Liu Kang, the coach ain't help out, so I call my own shots
I'm David Blaine, I'm breakin' out of my own box, you stay the same
But homie if you change, may you change for the better
Back when Martin King had a thing for Coretta
Wonder if she seen all the dreams he was dreamin'
Did she have a clue of all the schemes he was schemin'
Still loved him just enough to put up with the cheatin'
Months go by and only see him for a weekend
I say a prayer—hope my girl ain't leavin'
We all got angels, we all got demons
As you fall through the club
Bad bitches down to do all the above
Money come fast so bein' hungry don't last
'Til you look in the mirror and you saw who you was
Cole World—it couldn't be more clearer
The time is now—couldn't be more here-er
My reign gonna last like 3-4 eras
Say hello to the real, I can be your hero

[Chorus]
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gon' be no more
You thinking I'ma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines
You might also like[Verse 2]
Up in first class, laugh even though it's not funny
See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money
While he sit at coach, hate to see me walk past
Young black pants sag, headphones blastin'
Know what he askin', "How did he manage?"
"With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!"
Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish
Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us 'Bama
Laughin' at the grammar cause they didn't understand us
Must've thought we slow, but little do they know
I came up here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted
Opportunity, that I would kill for
Lookin' at rappers like "What the fuck you got a deal for?!"
When I was assed out with my funds low
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door

[Chorus]
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gon' be no more
You thinking I'ma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines
[Verse 3]
I made it to the rock, even though they tried to box me out
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out
But what they don’t understand is this is all planned
It’s a bigger picture and you can’t photoshop me out
Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out
Like I’m supposed to give a fuck
Don’t you know that I be out in France
Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao
Not cause my looks, cause my hooks could knock Rocky out
And my lines is designed from the heart
Young Simba been a lion from the start
Dumb niggas, y’all been lyin from the start
My life like a movie, truly
And these niggas is dyin' for the part
But, you’ll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan
Twenty years, wonder who they gone say was more important
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane
Who’s to say that who’s greater, all we know, they ain’t the same

[Chorus]
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gon' be no more
You thinking I'ma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

Her momma went to college, but yet her father was hustlin', uh
Found it funny 'cause now they daughter is stuck in
A similar predicament, I'm askin' where her nigga went
She said "Your guess is good as mine
Dropped outta school, now he run the streets, like, all the time
Left me alone with this baby, I don't hear from the nigga
And to keep it hundred with you, I don't care for the nigga"
Well, movin' on

Lyrics:

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, uh, yeah
You gotta lis—, you gotta follow me what I'm doin' right here, mane
Like, when I say this shit is crazy I don't mean it's crazy like crazy
I just mean crazy like it's fuckin'— it's actually crazy
Know what I mean?

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have
And then I end up fuckin' with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated
With the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait, is
Is fate procrastinatin'?
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause...

[Chorus: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams, yeah
Ay, is she good as what she seems? Uh
Or am I lyin' to myself? Uh
Ay, should I try and get some help? Yeah
This is the girl of my dreams, uh
Is she as good as what she seems? Uh
Or am I lyin' to myself? Hey
Ay, should I try and get some help? Yeah, yeah
You might also like[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
Hey, tell me, is it stalkin' if I follow her
Like, all the way home without her knowin'?
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides, when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occasionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she'll wave at me
Imagine what she'll say to me
This ain't no time to be afraid no more, it's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy

[Chorus: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams, hey
Ay, is she good as what she seems? Uh
Or am I lyin' to myself? Uh
Ay, should I try and get some help? Yeah
Say this is the girl of my dreams, yeah
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself? Uh
Ay, should I try and get some help? Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Look, I spot her walkin' in the mall
Okay, it's time to grow some balls if she really gon' be yours
Oh my God, I'm walkin' towards her
My mind's screamin' stop, but my legs keep walkin' forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you comin' for her
My heartbeat racin', and my hands keep shakin'
Say somethin', you shy motherfucker, she's waitin'
"What's up, girl? Don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women, but
[Bridge]
You from my dreams
Ay will you come true?
I know about a show that we can catch some R&B and rap, and you should come through."
She said, "Uh, I'd love to
Except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that." (Damn, damn)

[Verse 4: J Cole]
Okay, you say you got a man
I mean, I definitely understand
I'm happy for you, really am
I couldn't have been the only fan
In the world of a girl like you
I mean, you beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie
Well, I'm sure that I'm gon' see you 'round the city
Only thing I ask, if shit don't work out for y'all, don't forget me
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene
I came up with a world-class scheme, to get…

[Chorus: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
The girl of my dreams
Ay is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself? Uh
Or should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Ay, is she as good as what she seems? Huh
Or am I lyin' to myself? Uh
Ay, should I try and get some help? Yeah
[Verse 5: J. Cole]
Yeah, so I find out the nigga name
Know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work
"Hold up, nigga, is you sane?"
I'ma follow in my car, I'ma cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall
Maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time
Then console her while she cryin'
She gon' take that as a sign
Finally she will be mine
I'll be king, and she'll be queen
When I hit her with the ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing?

[Chorus: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams, haha
Is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
And should I try and get some help? Ay
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Think I should try and get some help

Haha, yeah, ay
What you think?

Title: High for Hours
Release Date: January 16, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-high-for-hours-lyrics
Song Description: This song was released on Martin Luther King Jr. Day 2017. J. Cole touches on his experience meeting President Barack Obama in the second verse and has thoughts of revolution in the third verse.

High for Hours was produced by Cam O'bi and Elite who also worked on Coles previous project.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
This is called being high as shit, for hours
That's the name of this song, nigga
"High as Shit for Hours"
Here we go, yeah

[Verse 1]
American hypocrisy, oh, let me count the ways
They came here seekin' freedom then they end up ownin' slaves
Justified it usin' Christianity which saves
Religion don't mean shit, there's too much ego in the way
That's why ISIS is a crisis
But in reality, this country do the same shit
Take a life and call it righteous
Remember when bin Laden got killed, supposedly?
In a hotel lobby after a show, was noticin'
These white ladies watchin' CNN, coverin' the action
They read the headline and then they all started clappin'
As if LeBron had just scored a basket at the buzzer
I stood there for a second, watched them high-five each other
For real? I thought this was "Thou shalt not kill"
But police still lettin' off on niggas in the Ville
Claimin' that he reached for a gun
They really think we dumb and got a death wish
Now somebody's son is layin' breathless
When I was a little boy my father lived in Texas
Pulled up in Toyota, drove that bitch like it was Lexus
Put my bag in his trunk and headed off for Dallas
Out there for the summer, feelin' just like I was Alice
Lost in the Wonderland where niggas still sufferin'
Just like they was back home, and that's wrong
So now it's fuck the government, they see my niggas strugglin'
And they don't give a fuck at all, and that's wrong, yeah

The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

[Verse 2]
I had a convo with the President, I paid to go and see him
Thinkin' about the things I said I'd say when I would see him
Feelin' nervous, sittin' in a room full of white folks
Thinkin' about the black man plight, think I might choke
Nope, raised my hand and asked a man a question
Does he see the struggle of his brothers in oppression?
And if so, if you got all the power and the clout
As the President, what's keepin' you from helpin' niggas out?
Well, I didn't say "nigga," but you catch my drift
He looked me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift
He broke the issues down and showed me he was well-aware
I got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared
But dawg, you in the chair, what's the hold-up?
He said, "There's things that I wanna fix
But you know this shit, nigga: politics"
Don't stop fightin' and don't stop believin'
You can make the world better for your kids before you leave it
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back 'til they kill me
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back until they kill me—feel me?
[Chorus]
The type of shit that make you wanna (Aight, third verse)
The type of shit that make you wanna let go
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

[Verse 3]
Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart
Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart
See the people at the top, they get to do just what they want
'Til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart
Then they start to holla, "Revolution"
Tired of livin' here, destitution
Fuck that lootin', can you tell me what's the best solution?
I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors, see
If we destroy the system, that means we'll have less of greed
But see, it's not that simple
I got to thinkin' about the history of human nature
While this instrumental played, then I realized somethin' that made
Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say
Think about this shit for a second, you heard the way
The children in abusive households grow up
Knockin' girlfriends out cold—that's called a cycle
Abused becomes the abuser and that's just how life go
So understand
You get the power, but you know what power does to man?
Corruption always leads us to the same shit again
So when you talk 'bout revolution, dawg, I hear just what you sayin'
What good is takin' over when we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you
I said what good is takin' over when we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you, nigga
[Chorus]
The type of shit that make you wanna (High for hours, nigga)
The type of shit that make you wanna let go (Volume one)
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go76Embed

Release Date: May 14, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-a-p-p-l-y-i-n-g-p-r-e-s-s-u-r-e-lyrics
Song Description: On a p p l y i n g . p r e s s u r e, Cole applies pressure in two ways; First, by exposing broke rappers for flaunting wealth they dont have and second, by demonstrating his skills on the mic with a verbose and dense verse.

Jermaine has discussed the superficiality of younger rappers in other songs including 1985 (Intro to The Fall Off) where he raps

You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that aint true

a p p l y i n g . p r e s s u r e shares the same name as a short documentary that was released on May 10th, 2021 which chronicles the making of the album.

The songs music video was released on May 25, 2021.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, nigga (One two, one two, one)
The Off-Season (One two, one two, one two, one)
The Off-Season, nigga
We offing niggas (Ayy, that's right)
Fuck you talkin’ 'bout? (That's right, ayy)
Offing niggas (Yeah, hey, yeah)
(Vocal up a little more, hey)

[Verse]
Uh, applying pressure
Started my grind where crime festers
And nines showing like they in they second trimesters (Pregnant)
That’s why when niggas throw a shot or two online, I pay no mind to their benign gesturеs (Mm)
Nigga, please, I got my mind on much bigger things, to say thе least
My latest speeches sound like they was released by David East (What up, East?)
Verses hit hard, never pitched hard or played the streets
These niggas' whips hard, behind closed doors, can't pay the lease (Uh)
Ain't nothin' wrong with livin' check to check 'cause most have to (I understand that)
Instead of cappin', why don’t you talk ’bout bein' a broke rapper? (I don’t understand that)
That's a perspective I respect because it's real
What it's like to be nice as fuck but got to stress to pay the bills
That was me in ’08, seein' no cake
Not even on dates I celebrated my birth
Just did the mental math and calculated my worth
Shit crazy, didn't know I got more M's than a real Slim Shady video (I'm the real Shady)
Big Boss, less Rick Ross, more like a wavy Hideo
Kojima, they tote steamers around the way we tippy-toe
'Round crack vials and cold-blooded killers, no reptiles
Just projectiles from niggas salty you rockin' the fresher textiles
I seen best pals grow up and switch (I hate to see it)
Sometimes over a couple dollars, more often over a bitch (Ah, I hate to see it)
I can cap and say that I never scratched my jealousy's itch
But thank God I conquered that 'cause if not I'd never be rich
Envy keep your pockets empty, so just focus on you
If you broke and clownin' a millionaire, the joke is on you
Money ain't everything, I never say that (Never)
But niggas throw stones knowin' they sell they soul to get wherever they at (Come on, man)
Just know these verses is some shit they gon' forever playback, nigga (Come on, nigga)
You might also like[Outro]
Hell yeah (Ooh)
Fuck, you know what it is, nigga
Don't even— man
Niggas try to act like they don't—, bitch
That's why I gotta flex sometimes
'Cause niggas just try to act like you just not that motherfuckin' nigga, like
Like you just really don't do it how you do it
Like niggas will really try to act like you don't do what you do
Nigga look you dead in your face
And really act like you don't do it to the level that you do it
That's why sometimes you gotta come through and just do it at the level that you do it in front of every nigga face
So they know the difference between you, the real niggas, and the mothafuckin' fraudulent niggas, man
Don't never get it fucked up
If a nigga can't do it like you do it sometimes you gotta do it in front of his fuckin' face so he'll know forever
"Damn, that nigga did it how I always wanted to do it and I'll never be able to do it like that"
Bitch, it's a difference (Ah)
(These are the same ones telling our people what we are and we aren't because we're just not working hard enough
And that mentality is what we're up against today
But this is good to know because this time, when we march on the Capitol
You can go ahead and let 'em know long before we get there, we're coming to get that check)

Title: Too Deep for the Intro
Release Date: November 12, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-too-deep-for-the-intro-lyrics
Song Description: Over a sped up, soulful sample of Erykah Badus Didnt Cha Know, Cole begins Friday Night Lights with a personal and motivational cut on never giving up on your dreams. In his three verses he raps on his underprivileged upbringing, his first time with a girl  a rather different story to Wet Dreamz  and his desire to achieve his life goals.

While speaking with the Huffington Post back in 2013, Cole was asked to identify his three favorite verses that hed written.

Ooh, thats hard. Villematic, just all the way through, Looking for Trouble and Too Deep for the Intro, first or second verse.

This is impressive considering the track allegedly only took him 15 minutes to pen.
Lyrics:

[Produced by J. Cole]

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, ahem
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Partially functional, half of me is comfortable
The other half is close to the cliff, like Mrs. Huxtable
These boys got them holsters and clips they pack like Lunchables
Like white boys in grade school, while we ate school-made food
Just eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit
Knowing when mama hit the store, she wasn't buying that shit
No, I ain't crying a bit, man, that's just life, that's how that shit work
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt
Gotta learn when you get hurt, even if it's with Cupid
He beat you and you went back, you's officially stupid
Oh yeah, I understand, that's your man, you had a plan
You been together for some years, you sticking with him for the kids
So you overlook the tears, but we both know that's a bad look
'Cause 20 years from now, your daughter'll probably get her ass whooped
Look, if this too deep for the intro, I'll find another use
But just in case it's perfect, let me introduce, Cole

[Chorus: Erykah Badu & J. Cole]
Time to save the world
Where in the world is all the time?
So many things I still don't know (Uh-uh, hey)
So many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes
But I ain't scared to take the weight

Man, is this too deep for the intro? If so, I'll find another use
But just in case it's perfect, let me introduce
It's Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move
A ill ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school
Still rap for hustlers and motherfuckers that hated school
Said, "That's for busters," then heard my shit and I made it cool
It's safe to say that I'm gifted as if I'm Christmas shopping
I got gangsta niggas lining up in admissions office
Ayy, possibly 'cause all the hoes a nigga scraped
A lot of shit up on my plate, so you know a nigga late
To my first class, I'd much rather sit up in first class
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash?
Wasn't experienced, so nah, I didn't wear it out
Always thought my first time would be someone I cared about
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed 'bout
I used that ass for practice, so I wasn't scared out my mind
You call it rhymes, I call it clearing out my mind
Was just a young boy staring out my blinds
'Til I got free from my mama leash
Running loose through the streets like a stray dog in heat
And we looking for some freaks, can you play? Pardon me
What's your name? Don't mistake me for no lame, no, not me
She knew I was on the team 'cause she seen how tall I be
In the club dappin’ niggas, eventually, R.I.P
Damn, you win some, you lose some, that's just how it happens
And if a nigga step up to you, then you gotta scrap 'em
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom
It's funny, I barely told nobody I started rapping
'Cause see, some niggas was haters that I just viewed as clowns
At fourteen, I knew I was the nicest dude around
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now
If they don't know your dreams, then they can't shoot 'em down
[Interlude: J. Cole]
Ha, yeah nigga, hell yeah
I felt that one in my fuckin' soul, nigga
Haha

[Outro: Erykah Badu]
Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Ooh, hey
I'm trying to decide
Which way to go
Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere36Embed

https://twitter.com/JColeNC/status/539848835485696000

When moving back to his hometown of Fayetteville, he spoke about how his life in the Hollywood lights only brought him fake happiness.

In an interview with NPR, Cole said that the song was recorded around the same time as Be Free, noting the similarity in the simple piano instrumentation and him singing on both tracks.
Lyrics:

[Produced by J. Cole]
[Directed by Scott Lazer]

[Refrain]

[Verse]
Free from pain, free from scars
Free to sing, free from bars
Free my dawgs, you're free to go
Block is hot, the streets is cold
Free to love, to each his own
Free from bills, free from pills
You roll it loud, the speakers blow
Life get hard, you ease your soul
It cleanse ya mind, learn to fly
Then reach the stars, you take the time
To look behind and say, "Look where I came
Look how far I done came"
They say that dreams come true
And when they do, that there's a beautiful thing

Title: St. Tropez
Release Date: December 9, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-st-tropez-lyrics
Song Description: Drastically changing from the mood of Fire Squad, we see the arch of the album changing as Coles career starts to take off.

The song is named after St. Tropez, France. While the verses could be about another relationship, St. Tropez has been used as a metaphor for fame and fortune in hip hop more than once.

During Coles 2014 Forest Hills Drive Tour, he has been breaking down the song.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibFDly_WNqI

The album credits state that Rose TS Desandies, a member of Coles touring band, performed the background vocals in this song.

St. Tropez samples Mobb Deeps Give Up The Goods (Just Step), along with Thats All Right With Me and Hollywood
Lyrics:

[Produced by J. Cole]

[Verse 1: J. Cole & TS, J. Cole]
Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to go to St. Tropez
Maybe I'll go, maybe I'll stay (Maybe I'll stay)
She asked me if I'm scared to fly
To tell the truth, I'm terrified
I never been that high before
Very bad reason not to go
Terrible reason not to go

[Hook: J. Cole & TS]

He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Ayy, from the door I showed you my scars
And I told you girl, "I won't lie-ie-ie"
If we at war, then this is a war
That I can't afford, no I, I, I
I wanted more but that was before
Lord knows I'm torn, so I–I cry (No I, I, I)
From the corner of my eye, baby
It's been hard for me to smile-ile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile-ile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile-ile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile

Title: Once an Addict (Interlude)
Release Date: April 20, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-once-an-addict-interlude-lyrics
Song Description: J. Cole uses Once an Addict to detail the development of his feelings concerning his mothers relationship with alcoholism. Cole uses this interlude to show that he also deals with drugs and substances like alcohol, in his personal circle. He ends up reminiscing and wishing that he had interfered more.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

[Verse]
Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, "Mama, go to sleep"
She tell me "Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed"
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, "Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'

Something's got a hold on me

Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
Choose wisely (right)

Title: Be Free
Release Date: August 15, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-be-free-lyrics
Song Description: As many other people did, including Killer Mike, J. Cole took to the internet to express his pain for the loss of Michael Brown. Cole also visited Ferguson in the aftermath of the grand jurys decision not to indict the officer who killed Brown.

https://twitter.com/JColeNC/status/499615515779035136

He then released Be Free on August 15, 2014 via SoundCloud with the following message:

Rest in Peace to Michael Brown and to every young black man murdered in America, whether by the hands of white or black. I pray that one day the world will be filled with peace and rid of injustice. Only then will we all Be Free

On December 10, Cole performed Be Free on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote his third studio album 2014 Forest Hills Drive and added an extra rap verse. The track was finally added to streaming services on August 14, 2020, nearly six years after its original release.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
And I'm in denial, uh
And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile

And there ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul
Oh no

And all we wan' do is take the chains off

All we wan' do is break the chains off and
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is be free

[Interlude 1: Dorian Johnson:]
So now it was like the officer is pulling him inside the car and he's trying to pull away. And at no time the officer said that he was going to do anything until he pulled out his weapon. His weapon was drawn and he said, "I'll shoot you" or, "I'm going to shoot" and in the same moment, the first shot went off. And we looked at him and he was shot and there was blood coming from him, and we took off running—

[Bridge]
Are we all alone
Fighting on our own?
Please give me a chance
I don't wanna dance
Something's got me down
I will stand my ground
Don't just stand around
Don't just stand around
[Interlude 2: Dorian Johnson:]
As we took off running I ducked and hid for my life, 'cause I was fearing for my life, and I hid by the first car I saw. My friend, he kept running, and he told me to keep running 'cause he feared for me, too. So as he was running the officer was trying to get out of the car, and once he got out the car he pursued my friend—his weapon was drawn. Now he didn't see any weapon drawn at him or anything like that, us going for no weapon. His weapon was already drawn when he got out the car. He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and started to get down, but the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and he fired seven more shots and my friend died
[Chorus]
And all we wan' do is take the chains off
All we wan' do is break the chains off and
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is take the chains off
All we wan' do is break the chains off and
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is be free188Embed

Title: Lion King on Ice
Release Date: July 22, 2020, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-lion-king-on-ice-lyrics
Song Description: On Lion King on Ice, J. Cole reverts to his alter ego, Young Simba, but now in a much colder and darker tone. He raps about his come-up and his experience growing up in Fayetteville, where he wasnt always certain that he would see the next day. He furthers this by reflecting on the challenges he has endured in his career and realizing that his fame and wealth havent erased the trauma of his past.

Parts of the song are rapped from the perspective of a young Cole, as he raps about needing to prove himself and rise to the top of the rap game, both of which the current Cole has already accomplished.

Two days before releasing this song, Cole published an essay titled The Audacity in which he discussed how the feeling of needing to prove himself is what drove him when he first began rapping:

When I started rapping, it was the competition that drove me. I had a burning desire to be the best in the world and to prove it with every verse.

This and The Climb Back were initially the first two singles from Coles album, The Fall Off, and were released together as Lewis Street. However, the latter was relocated to The Off-Season in May 2021.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Your every kiss, your every touch

[Chorus]
I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie
I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, uh

[Verse 1]
Sip from the bottle for shit that we bottlin' in
Goin' live, but we not on the 'Gram
This the land of supply and demand
Where my young niggas choppin' up grams
And them choppers won't pry from they hands
Packin' lead like they got a exam
If it's beef, my niggas look just like homewreckers
They got they eye on your mans
I pray to God that it jam
Too many done died in these parts
So we gotta be smart if we tryna see August
Some niggas won't make it past summer regardless
I'm tryin' my hardest to stack my deposits
These niggas be lookin' at me like I got it
Deep down inside, though, I still feel as broke
As that nigga who just graduated from college
Scrapin' up change that got left in my pockets
I'm tryna make nickels turn into a dollar
Ridin' the train, way too shy to go holler
Just watched her get off at her stop, I'm a coward
Fuck it, though, you got a way bigger target
I'ma do it so big, they won't know what to call it
Sound like a whole Lambo' truck in my stomach
Bitch, I ain't hungry, this feeling is starving
Gotta move mama from out them apartments
Gotta put 'Ville on the map, we forgotten
Gotta hit hoes you hang up in your locker
Gotta get rich, 'cause my granny picked cotton
Gotta make hits, 'cause if not, then I'm floppin'
Gotta stay me in the process
Niggas dissed me, it was nonsense
I sat 'em down like his father
My nigga asked, "Why you bother?
We should've caught him and mobbed him"
I said, "We gotta move smarter"
Don't wan' be the reason for one more sad song
I tried to warn niggas they wouldn't last long
I hope that you see how they came and they went
They shots never hit, but they made they attempts
May have a good year like that name on the blimp
But you know what it takes to be poppin' this long?
Dedication on another level niggas never seen in they life
Celebratin' all your first downs like they touchdowns bring a price
Young Simba had the bustdown, yeah, the Lion King on ice
Niggas wanted me to look the part, had to stop takin' advice
Put the jewelry to the side, had to find me, had to find God
Half the time, we be pacifyin', what they expect from us?
But that's treacherous, that shows less of us
I need y'all to see every part of me
Every scar and every artery
Every story that I can recall, then I can fall

I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie (Uh)

[Verse 2]
Lately, I reflect on the times a nigga was low
I got it up off the floor, I'm stronger than ever before
I'm stronger than ever before just like I planned to be
They wanna see me fold, it ain't no thang to me
Thoughts when I was broke, if only I could be
Pockets holdin' hope, it ain't no thang to me
At night, I hit my knees, I prayed for better days
Then found a better me, I got my head on straight

[Outro]
Up, up, and away, just ridin' my wave, I ain't never gon' say nothin'
Nigga throw a shot my way, I just jot down names, ain't never gon' say nothin'
Know you be stressin', hate only block your blessin', I'm never gon' say nothin'
Quit all that flexin', niggas live check to check, I'm never gon' say nothin'
Know that it's destined83Embed

Lyrics:

[Intro: Jay-Z]
There's a nigga right now somewhere
He at the table with a bowl of Apple Jacks
And he's reading the back of the cereal
And in between eating the Apple Jacks he's writing some shit
And he wants my spot
I'mma find him though, I'mma sign him..
I don't want no problems

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Like we always do at this time, Cole blowin' your mind
Hey dummy, this no accident, all of this was designed
T—t—t—took my time, c—c—crept from behind
And I opened up your blinds, rise and shine, Cole World
Same nigga used to drive around with yo girl
In my mama's Civic, now I'm out here tryna get it
I ain't like you lame ass niggas, boy I spit it how I live it
So when you see me in the streets, man I ain't gotta mimic
'Cause I ain't got an image to uphold, this real shit
I ain't got a gimmick, I just flow, the niggas went nuts for
The boy that set fire to the booth
In a game full of liars, it turns out that I'm the truth
Some say that rap's alive, it turns out that I'm the proof
'Cause the ones y'all thought would save the day can't even tie my boots
The ones y'all thought could hang with me can't even tie my noose
Let these words be my bullets, nigga, I don't rhyme, I shoot, bang!

Hope my mama get to see Jamaica before she meet her maker
I hoop was never good enough to ever be a Laker
But these words I record got me ballin', Jordan
More than a rapper, this a natural disaster
Boy, I'm meaner than Katrina mixed with Gina, "Shut up, Cole!"
This is for my niggas back home, homes, what up, bo?
This is for the bitches that played me, what up, ho?
Nah, I ain't mad, it's sad, you went from bad to real bad
Two kids that don't even know their real dad
Real sad, baby girl I wish you still had it
Then maybe you could get a taste of livin' Villematic
Is Cole still at it? Y'all be talkin' about the same shit
That's how I feel about it, mama was a real addict
That's why I don't respect that lyin' ass white shit you talkin'
Cole's planning funerals, you might fit the coffin

Get on your job lil mane, this ain't Saturday
We in two different lanes, you can't navigate
We in two different games, you playin' patty cake
Brother you're lame, you're Shane Battier
You out of shape, my mind run a mile a minute
The sky's the limit, I'm so high, I'm divin' in it
My rides is tinted, my knob's gettin' slobbed up in it
She hollerin' God, man you would've thought that God was in it
But it's just a nigga God invented
The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it
But if this shit ain't fire nigga, why you noddin' with it?
The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin' with it
Now you all conflicted cause my flows is wicked
And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin' me
Cause they know a star when they see a star, nigga
Ain't even got to fuck him to know he a raw nigga
I got her in my bedroom, but cheer up, nigga
You saved so many hoes, you a hero, nigga!
Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac
When he slept with Madonna, hey, this is death before dishonor
Get arrested and forget to tell my mama
She got enough to stress about, my niggas gonna get me out
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors
No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?
Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it
When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set
It goes tick-tock, game on lock
Son gon' shine but the reign won't stop, oh no

If I should die before I wake

Song Description: The first single off J. Coles sophomore album Born Sinner, Miss America is Coles return, bringing a new attitude and his views on the social state of his country and the rap game.

This song samples Rue Royales Flightline, which can be heard around the 11-second mark.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
This is a public service announcement
Brought to you by the good people over at Dreamville Records
"And so my fellow Americans
Ask not what your country can do for you
Ask what you can do for your country!"
Excuse me

[Verse 1]
Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get Oscars
All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg
Don't trip nigga, they just words
Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs
Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse
Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church
Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo
And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo
Bumpin' my shit, always wondered why they fuck with my shit
I hope it's 'bout the knowledge, not about who's suckin' my dick
But oh well, I'm gon' sell like I had no bail
For my chain and my piece I should've won Nobel
Ill, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggas

If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge

[Post-Chorus]
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain

[Verse 2]
Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit
I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'ma pass your classes, I'ma learn your craft
I'ma fuck your daughters, I'ma burn your flag
[Chorus]
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances, we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit

The intro samples NBA star Damian Lillards August 11, 2020, post-game interview after a 61-point game. Dame is known by the moniker Dame Time, a name he earned from hitting game-winners. The song title may be a nod to Lillards nickname and point to the clock celebration.

The bookend of the song samples Lillards response to the media after hitting the walk-off three against Oklahoma in 2019s playoffs. The excerpt highlights the theme of the album, which Cole explained in his 2021 interview with SLAM Magazine:

The Off-Season symbolizes the work that it takes to get to the highest height. The Off-Season represents the many hours and months and years it took to get to top form the offseason is where the magic really happens.
Lyrics:

[Intro: J. Cole & Damian Lillard]
It ain't nothing I want more
Ain't nothing I want more
I ain't c–
I told you, when I first came here, I said, "I ain't come here to waste my time"
I came here
They gave us a chance to get in, like we asked for
And that's, that's what we here to do
Yeah, nigga, 2-6
The job still ain't done
Straight up
But I, I said, "You, you know what I'm here for"

[Verse: J. Cole]
Back on top, punchin' the clock, clutchin' sanity
I got more cribs than Habitat for Humanity
Shit profound, we propagating more profanity
Paid off collections from recollections of calamity (Oh shit, look, that nigga 'bout to shoot)
The shit pop off, I learned to duck under the canopy (Oh shit, run, nigga, run)
'Til it cool off, they murked a nigga right in front of me
Told him to come off his chain for tryna floss
Died over a cross just like the start of Christianity
When I was a boy, the teacher often reprimanded me (Jermaine)
Thought it was toys, it was a Glock this nigga handed me
I busted the trees, was barely strong enough to squeeze
Bullets traveled through leaves, it probably killed somebody randomly
Ran in the crib and played it off amongst the family
Nightmare scenes, the police finally apprehended me
Woke up screamin', seen a demon had his hand on me
Still sport the scar on my arm from where he branded me
Like a Que Dog, my niggas burnin' with the mute off
Loud pack smoke through the cracks, I catch a contact
Triggerin' a paranoid mindset, now I'm back
Teeterin' between enlightened and insanity
Now that I'm rich, I feel nobody understandin' me
All I can do is cut the mic on, holler at you
Can't let the fame scare me off from speaking candidly
All them niggas that sold 'caine, they started singin' like Danity
Now I'm left here, paid like I planned to be, damn

A lotta times, those situations are, um, are handled way before the time comes
In the summer, I think when you truly prepare yourself, and
With training and conditioning, and things like that
When you cheat yourself, you fail in those moments
You know, you crash, and when you really put the time in and
Whether people see it, or whether people know it or not
You know, it always come to light84Embed

Lyrics:

Part I: "'93 'Til Infinity" by Souls of Mischief

[Verse]
Yeah
Rest assured, the best is here in the flesh, and that's for sure
The rest should wear 'em a vest, I'm set for war, nigga, press record
I send niggas to address the Lord
Same flow that put your neck to sword
The same flow that just undressed your whore
Takeover, nigga, check the score
This is chess, better check your board
Who gave the world more fire, but got less reward?
No stress, my only guess is that less is more
More or less hundred G's in my dresser drawer
I'm blessed, hope IRS don't arrest me for it, I'm new to it
My new crib got the Times Square view to it
While two bitches lay in my bed, I'm used to it
That's your best friend givin' me head, now you do it
See, mami, it's not so weird
After I hit, I cut you off like Picasso ear
Van Gogh or whoever
Goddamn, Cole, you're too clever
Like a fuckin' James Brown sample, you're two-ever
Times two, that's forever
More treble, meanin' more high-end shit on your level
Put the fear of God in niggas, I'm pure Devil
Walkin' contradiction my description
Off the top, magician, compositions nonfiction
Shitted in the competition's pot to piss in
Gone, uh, so long, uh
Saturdays, a nigga used to mow lawns, uh
Nowadays, a nigga be eatin' prawns
Fuck my bitch by the window, wave to the peepin' Toms, ugh
Yes, I'm Carolina's finest
Southern nigga with New York stamps, honest
Out in Queens with the fiends, I'm your highness
Cole World, don't mistake it for a sinus infection
At this point, I'm just flexin'
Bas is next in line, and the test is time
Play the game right, nigga, he gon' rest his mom
In the sands of Sudan where she rest her mind
And find peace, 'cause her son'll be fine
He got the city on his back, and I got him on mine
You think I'm lyin'? Shit
Step one, got the 'Ville on map
Shit I predicted in my raps, I done did all that
Next please, eat rappers, mmm, check please
Here's a tip while niggas grip my testes
You wan' shoot? Then shoot, don't play with me
Hardest shit out the South since slavery, nigga
Hardest shit out the South since slavery, nigga

[Verse]
Ugh
Woke up this morning and wondered
"Hey, should I get fresh or should I keep it humble?"
My closet like Dover Street, used to be bummin'
Some days, I'm still bummin', the difference is now, it's by choice
Got dressed and peeped out the window
These lil' niggas different, they don't play Nintendo, they play with extendos
I hope you can limbo
That chopper gon' spin you around like a judge on The Voice
I'm from a city where most niggas never get lucky enough
To see somethin' outside county limits, I ran up the digits
I don't have no muh'fuckin' business complainin' about nothin'
Ain't got no time or no patience for lists they be makin'
Or who they debatin' is better
Let's face it, he one of the greatest
No Bill Cosby shit, but if niggas is sleepin', then fuck 'em
Most niggas don't understand me
I don't do the GRAMMY's, I be in my jammies on sofa
Most niggas don't understand me
Ferrari or Camry, I bet I look good in 'em both
Most niggas don't even get this
"Cole, how you on top but you don't got no bitches?" I know
Most niggas don't even get this
If given the chance, they trade family for riches, I know
Look at my ceilin', it's endless
I'm sick and these bitch niggas feelin' the symptoms
It ain't enough vitamin C in they system to get rid of me
I'ma kill 'em relentless
On top, I sound like I'm still in the trenches
I come from the 'Ville, I turn villains to victims
Reach and see "R.I.P." fill up your mentions
A message for niggas that's feelin' ambitious
How come a nigga still ain't hit his prime?
Ahh, you bitch, Off-Season comin' May 14th
Fuck all y'all niggas, it's over for you
I swear to God31Embed

Title: Chaining Day
Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-chaining-day-lyrics
Song Description: Chaining Day, track 12 on Born Sinner, tells the story of Coles concerns over materialistic objects, specifically addressing one of hip-hops biggest hypocrisies: the Jesus Piece.



Part of the albums ongoing theme, this track is about greed, one of the seven deadly sins.

The beat is sampled from the song Sho' Nuff by Sly, Slick and Wicked.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Ayy
Cole World
Forreal

[Verse 1]
Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors, I'm just paintin' my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped a Range Rover, my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy, I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say, "I see you"
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you, wonder what he do?
If a hater snatch your chain, I bet it still won't free you
'Cause I be right back grinding 'til I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said, "That's just the game, my nigga"
Swear I heard my jeweler say, "Here go your chain my nigga"
This is chaining day

I need you to love me (Chaining day), love me (Oh, my chaining day)
I need you to love me (My chaining day), love me
My last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (Love me, love me, hey hey)
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear (Love me, love me)
They even iced out Jesus' hair

[Verse 2]
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Roley
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
Same shit a rich white motherfucka' laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home a nigga sick today
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd probably sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', "Fake it 'til you make it"
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And acted like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated to that hundred racks, I gave it up
For what?
[Chorus]
I need you to love me (Chaining day), love me (Ohh, my chaining day)
I need you to love me (My chaining day), love me
My last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (Love me, love me, hey hey)
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear (Love me, love me)

[Bridge]
Lord, this is the last time (Haha)
Told my accountant, "It's the last time"
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said that shit last time
But this the last time
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
'Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
'Cause I love this slavery

[Outro]
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I need you to love me, love me, love me

Title: Dollar and a Dream III
Release Date: September 27, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-dollar-and-a-dream-iii-lyrics
Song Description: In Dollar and A Dream III, Cole reaches new heights.

The first segment of the Dollar and a Dream series appeared on 2007s The Come Up. The second installment appeared on 2009s The Warm Up.

The song samples Darkness of the Unknown by Yoko Shimomura for the Kingdom Hearts II: Original Soundtrack.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, hey, Cole world

[Chorus]
Hey, I gotta dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So if it's 'bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 1]
Cole, walk with a nigga, I give you my pain
So much on my mind, I wonder how it fit in my brain
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off
'Cause I still don't see hope, lookin' for a quick fix
When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke
Knowin' it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got em'
They say he wouldn't leave me, yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn
Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar
And the stress of this mess you in can make your ass holla?
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?
No longer fightin', now the only thing you grow is old
Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?
Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a king
Cole!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, armed and ready, you niggas strung out, you spaghetti
Ya paper, confetti, small time, y'all on one, I'm on mine
You logged off 'cause I'm online, small talk from small minds
I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town
This where I get my dough
My niggas make sure the money right and then I rip the show
I run the town they tried to call me underground
I spun around like, you wish
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this
I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit
Play your part, life is but a dream for me
I get a flash of nightmares when niggas scheme on me
It's hard to see my enemies, who infiltrated my team
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams
I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me
I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me
Ya never have it, I know you want what I got
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me
If ya don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay
Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet
My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million
And as soon as I do, Mama that 9 to 5 is through
And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And all the shit that you been through
My girl and then my brother too
'Cause this life gets hard on this road, yeah it's true
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do
But I suck it up for who? My fans and my mans
Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes
Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' "Goddamn, what's her name?"
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
And then my other side kick in like, "Bitch, don't be so fuckin' lame"
Dang, what a life, another day, another night
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me
Just for those prayin' for me, man I know that y'all worry
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will
Cole!
[Pre-Chorus]
Young nigga with his jeans low

I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Now do I roll up, get higher?
Or po' up, get tired?
Do I roll up, get higher?
Or po' up, get tired? Yeah

[Verse 1]
Okay, I'm back on a mission to pay my tuition
Got loans out the ass, what you know 'bout my past?
I was so late for class, hit the probate, get trashed
Fell asleep off the Henny, back in '08, I crashed
With my foot on the gas, thank the Lord I'm still here
No insurance, so now I'm racin' home on first gear
On that morn' I shed tears, asking what I'm doing here
I should be rich, I'm sick, it's like I got the fuckin' flu in here
But yet I'm just chillin' like I'm back on the yard
My niggas say I'm the truth and when I rap they applaud
That what was my Unsigned Hype like in the back of The Source
It's like I'm tryna get the head, but she just jackin' me off
I needed more
Had to earn stripes, no Adidas store
Put my feet on floor, borrow money from mi amor
Just to cop a microphone, the same one that put me on tour
She held you down, now you out here fuckin' 'round

[Hook: J. Cole]
Now this is for my broke niggas, rich niggas, what?
Gold diggers, Crys sippers, what?
Cold nigga, flow sicker, what?
Muh'fucker, I'm a fuckin' head bussa, go
Coming down on the strip, liqour in the whip
Parking lot pimp, enough game to be sold
Learn from me, fuck bitches, burn money
Someone told me boy you got your whole life to get old
But everything that glitter ain't gold
The grass ain't greener, I've been told
She told me, "Boy you want your cake and eat it too?"
I said "It's cake, that's what you're supposed to do?"

See, I thought that would help me, it turns out it's worse now
My girl want her first child, my label won't work out
My mama don't see me unless I'm on TV, I pray she (dont break down)
She strong, but she need me
They killed Saddam, now I wonder who's sane
How you balance being Batman, Bruce Wayne?
Old chick callin', but I'm onto new things
She still a dime, but I always lose change
Young Simba, went from bottom of the food chain to a few chains in a new Range
She tellin' me "So much has happened, would've thought you changed!"
We ain't fuck in nine months its safe to say I'm due man

Title: Niggaz Know
Release Date: May 30, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-niggaz-know-lyrics
Song Description: This is the third release off of J. Coles 2013 album Born Sinner, and is yet another diverse and intriguing view of the sophomore album.

The song contains a plethora of Biggie lines. A trend he perhaps learnt from his mentor. Most of them come from Notorious Thugs; also the beat is loosely sampled off of the baseline of that track.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
These niggas know
Huh

[Verse 1]
Armed and dangerous, call the law
Stick to the script, no audible
Country ass nigga with an Audemars
Can't spell the shit but I order more
French hoes treat me like Charles De Gaulle
Get good head on the Autobahn
Hit hood hoes out in Baltimore
Pack the shows like wall to wall, my God
Five steps like Dru Hill
Came home from the first tour, with
Bad credit and a school bill
Middle finger to the bursar
Finally famous but
Ain't too much really change with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us notorious, that was '97
Saw my old teacher and she asked how I'm livin'
You ain't know my shit drop bitch? 9-11
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game would do to you
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Better me than you

[Chorus]
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know

[Verse 2]
These niggas know, boo-ya nigga?
Came through the door like who y'all niggas?
Stole a nigga flow, I could sue y'all niggas
Better yet put a hot one through y'all niggas
Nah, let me stop frontin' for y'all niggas but
Don't let the college shit fool y'all niggas
Ain't the hardest nigga in the land
But a grown ass man, and I will step to y'all niggas
Like what's the problem?
Ain't gettin' paper, nigga here's a loan
My shit long, need a hair salon
Get it cut, shut the fuck up
And wipe your face with my money 'til your tears is gone
No cryin' ass, lyin' ass
Can't afford a whip, but you buyin' ass
This Fresh Prince nigga, I ain't Jazz
Fucked yo bitch, nigga I ain't ask
She pitched it to me like Sosa (Oh God)
What the fuck was I s'posed do?
Deny that, rather try that, but I never fly that
Keep hoes bi-coastal
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free
Dick the only thing that they get from me
Sit VIP, get a sip for free
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally
Picture me at the tip-top
With your bitch lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
This B.I.G. nigga, this Pac
Minus six shots, but it's still this hot
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch
Hate to brag but backpacker that's hip hop
Write my life and make sure that the script hot
And pray the kids watch, if not
These niggas know
If not, these niggas know

I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came home, I ain't the same

Title: Mo Money (Interlude)
Release Date: June 18, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-mo-money-interlude-lyrics
Song Description: The tracks title is a reference to The Notorious B.I.G.s hit song Mo' Money Mo' Problems. Meanwhile Coles money flow here is seemingly an ode to verse 1 of Jay-Zs Imaginary Player.

Billboard notes:

Dont believe the parenthetical in the song title. This is a real song, albeit, a relatively brief one. While eerie theremin sounds intertwine, Cole raps about greenbacks, skilfully ending each line with money.  Its one of the most quotable verses on the album, and will be an inevitable street favorite.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Mo' money, yeah
Mo' money, blow money, show money
Party money, side ho money, dope money
New clothes money from shit that I wrote money
So much money I don't know who stole from me
Hard to keep track I'm used to having no money
Still broke compared to niggas with old money
I mean the type of niggas that laugh at Hov money
Billionaires with petroleum and coal money
Probably kill they selves if they had Cole money
Talk shit and I'ma see you like you owe money
I'm wrapping up the album, fourth quarter I'm so money
I'm overseas looking for trees to grow money
Peter Popoff, robbing people for hope money
Prostitutes collecting that "let me stroke" money
Put up a couple dollars for the liquor store money
Used to dread the strip club cause I couldn't throw money
Now the strippers give a nigga the throat for no money
How mama gonna teach you how to save your money
When she barely on the boat, got stay afloat money
Blacks always broke cause we don't know money
Spend it 'fore we get it and could never hold money
No wallets, nah, nigga we'd rather fold money
Money control niggas, white man control money
Laughing like "yeah yeah my nigga get your money"You might also like31Embed

Title: Port Antonio
Release Date: October 10, 2024, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-port-antonio-lyrics
Song Description: Port Antonio was released as a surprise drop via Coles Instagram on Wednesday night, October 9, 2024. This unconventional release timing signals that Cole wasnt looking to dominate the charts, but rather to address significant truths.

The first verse focuses on Coles come-up, detailing his rise from modest beginnings and his struggle with fame and staying true to himself. He reminisces about the challenges he faced, balancing ambition with maintaining his values.

In the second verse, Cole addresses the infamous Drake-Kendrick Lamar feud, reflecting on why he forfeited his involvement in the conflict earlier in April 2024. At the time, Cole issued a public apology to Kendrick at Dreamville Fest and removed his diss track 7 Minute Drill from streaming platforms. Now, in Port Antonio, Cole provides a mature perspective on the situation, explaining the emotional weight and potential regret that come with trying to protect ones legacy in the industry. He emphasizes his decision to prioritize peace and self-awareness over fueling the rivalry.

The title, Port Antonio, references a peaceful town in Jamaica, symbolizing Coles desire to find peace and distance himself from the chaos of the rap game. The instrumental, produced by Omen, DZL and Cole, samples the live version of Cleo Sols Know That You Are Loved, as well as the Lonnie Liston Smith song A Garden of Peace. The latter song was famously sampled on Jay-Zs Dead Presidents II, offering a nostalgic connection to Coles earlier work on his 2009 mixtape, The Warm Up, where he performed his own rendition of the track.
Lyrics:

[Refrain]
Ride to it, ride to it
Ride to it, ride to it
Ride to it, ride to it
Ride to it, ride to it, uh
Ride to it, ride to it
Ride to it, ride to it
Ride to it, ride to it
Ride to it (Uh)

[Verse 1]
Young Jermaine walked the straight and narrow
Minimum-wage jobs for dinero, but still, my mind was on the zeros
I fiend for the perks that was seen flippin' birds, so
We was skippin' church, but my eyes was on the sparrows
Niggas flippin' pies, spendin' thousands on apparel
Shit, I wanna shine too, I want dimes too
Jealous niggas wanna know just how my rhymes blew
Mano y mano, I'm Bono, I'm you times two
Now I'm bougie, I done outgrew the fountain blue
But never forgot the spot where I developed my plot
To dwell at the top, the Ville, where all my skeletons locked
If I could do it all over, then I never would swap
I've seen good, I've seen bad, had my melanin mocked
I've seen lifelong friends turn to devilish opps
I was Mike in red leather, tryna tell him to stop
You better beat it 'fore you see the heavy-metal get popped
He was a mean-ass wing with a hell of a shot
But if no team draft King, he gon' bet on the block
He wanna ball 'til he fall or 'til the federals knock
And sit his ass on a bench for movin' careless with rock
You can't relate, 'less your father was not around
And your mother went out and found someone else and then brought them 'round
And they salaries then combine, when they married, it brought you out
Of that poverty, then you moved to a soft little part of town
So that when you back in the hood, you feel awkward about it now (Damn)
And your confidence start to drown
But the rappin' gave you some positive thoughts, so you jot 'em down
You jot 'em down

[Verse 2]
Benjamin Button, Cole flows reverse time
To find deliveries good as mine, you gotta search primes
I'm scaling heights higher than birds can perch
Tryin' to be something, hopin' that peace comes to my cursed mind
One thing's for sure, that I've matured from my first rhyme
I learned long ago, you can't please 'em all, and it hurts tryin'
In this game, where all you've got is your name
Like Durk, I'm smirkin' at niggas tryna besmirch mine
Absurd times, where the fake get toted as wise
I can see hate in both of your eyes, but the third's blind
So you search lines, but you struggle
Which explains the puzzled look on the dull face as the word finds
I hate what rap's become, but like do-not-disturb signs
Can't knock it if I see it's 'bout the dough
They instigate the fuckery because it's profitable
But singin' "stop the violence" tunes when dudes in hospitals
I pulled the plug because I've seen where that was 'bout to go
They wanted blood, they wanted clicks to make they pockets grow
They see this fire in my pen and think I'm dodgin' smoke
I wouldn't have lost a battle, dawg, I woulda lost a bro
I woulda gained a foe, and all for what? Just to attain some mo'
Props from strangers that don't got a clue what I been aimin' for?
Since the age of fourteen, Jermaine is no king
If that means I gotta dig up dirt and pay the whole team
Of algorithm-bot niggas just to sway the whole thing
On social media, competin' for your favorable memes
To be considered best or live and rest? The weight of both things
I understand the thirst of being first that made 'em both swing
Protecting legacies, so lines got crossed, perhaps regrettably
My friends went to war, I walked away with all they blood on me
Now some will discredit me, try wipe away my pedigree
But please, find a nigga out that's rappin' this incredibly, uh
My dawg texted me, I'll share the words he said to me
"If you refuse to shoot the gun, don't mean the gun ain't deadly," uh
I guess in that metaphor, hypothetically, the gun is me
I text him back like, "Guess a gun ain't what I'm tryna be, my nigga"
They strip me of my spot, and now I'm finally free, my nigga
They say I'm pickin' sides, ayy, don't you lie on me, my nigga
Then start another war, ayy, Drake, you'll always be my nigga
I ain't ashamed to say you did a lot for me, my nigga
Fuck all the narratives
Tappin' back into your magic pen is what's imperative
Remindin' these folks why we do it, it's not for beefin'
It's for speakin' our thoughts, pushin' ourselves, reachin' the charts
Reaching your minds, keepin' your hearts, creepin' to find
Emotions to touch, somethin' inside to open you up
Help you cope with the rough times and shit
I'm sendin' love 'cause we ain't promised shit
My nigga
[Chorus]
Y'all niggas ain't stoppin' me (Yeah, know that you are loved)
Y'all niggas ain't stoppin' me (Y'all niggas, ooh)
Y'all niggas ain't stoppin' me
Y'all niggas ain't stoppin' me (Even if you don't love yourself)
Y'all niggas ain't stoppin' me

Title: Mr. Nice Watch
Release Date: September 14, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-mr-nice-watch-lyrics
Song Description: J. Cole and Jay-Z split bars on Mr. Nice Watch, taken from the formers heavily-anticipated debut album Cole World: The Sideline Story. The song is a nod to the classic Hov line, Ughh, nice watch, a line that also spurred a blog.
Lyrics:

[Intro: J. Cole]
Hey, huh, Cole World
Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, everybody got a bad side, drop, let me see that shit
What you say? "Cole ain't hot," what?
Where you read that shit? You believe that shit?
All cause some lame nigga tweet that shit?
Have you seen my shows? Have you seen my hoes?
If I wasn't hot, would they be so thick?
Guess not, got the game in a headlock
I'm blasting that, I'm laughing at you old niggas, Redd Foxx
Don't mind me, boy, I'm red hot, aw, nigga, they not
I'm over here, I'm over there, I'm everywhere, they not (I said)
You'll never play me, nice try, balling in a nice spot
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch
You don't want no problems, put yourself in a tight spot
So, you can look, but don't touch
I stay on my toes like the White Sox, cause

[Chorus: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it, I'll make that back, go
Ugh, nice watch (turn up)
Ugh, nice watch (I know)
Ugh, nice watch
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Hello, Mr. Nice Watch

Stack on black, I ain't never been a high-roller
Now it's racks on racks, never thought that I would ride Rover
But I'm back on track, add to the fact that I never really drive sober
Cole World, but I'm hot as shit, do that mean that I'm bipolar?
Young, black and gifted, I rap like it's Christmas Eve
Coach wouldn't let a nigga off the bench
Now wonder why I didn't quit the team, but
I'm cut from a different sleeve
Cole World 'til the wrist'll freeze
Hurry up wit' your pictures please, I gotta make history

[Chorus: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money, but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no, you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care

Ugh, nice watch (I know)

Hello, Mr. Nice Watch
[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Yeah, I got a Hublot, I call it Tebow
I strap that bitch with a gator band
Y'all niggas ball half-time, y'all niggas like the Gator band
Y'all niggas need a time out
Who got these niggas all wound up?
Cocksucker, I'm 730
Y'all know where y'all niggas gonna wind up?
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch
Only but a matter of time 'fore I hit y'all niggas with a nice shot
Y'all niggas better not call the law
Get no blood on my Audemar
Meaning y'all better not waste my time
When y'all ready I take you all to war
Meanwhile I'm just choppin' off doors
Put the front on the back, 'cause I'm back and forth
Put the front on the back of the 'Bach like a boss
So I'm frontin' on niggas when I'm backin' off
Uh, what up, Cole? It's your time, let's these niggas know
Adjust your Rollie on these motherfucking hoes
Whenever you ready, go

[Outro: J. Cole]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Ugh, nice watch)
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Ugh, nice watch)

Song Description: Left over track from J. Coles debut album, Cole World: The Sideline Story. This song finds Cole reminiscing over a relationship gone bad. This track samples They Dont Care About Us, by the one and only King Of Pop, Michael Jackson.
Lyrics:

[Chorus]
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
When this shit end, man it's gon' get ugly
Real real ugly, your grandmama love me
And your mama love me, little sister hugs me
Even got a few homegirls that wanna fuck me, uh
Soon as this shit end, forget about it
You been stayin' in my crib, you gotta get up out it
'Cause if you layin' in my bed, let's admit about it
One time fuckin' and we no longer upset about it
'Cause when this shit ends it's either all or nothin'
I thought you loved me, how the hell you gon' call ya cousin?
You know the diesel ass, half slow, evil ass
Nigga in that Honda showin' up with that drama
On my mama, we been through it all
From the goods to the bads, rise to the fall
You done seen me at my best, seen me at my worst
So when this shit ends, know it's gon' hurt
You can't say we didn't try though, huh
You might also like[Chorus]

I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
They say we won't last
I know you suspicious, but you don't ask
And I don't tell, that's where we both fell
A good nigga gone bad
Good chick, alone, mad as fuck, she done had enough
I be out here tryna raise my status up
But success bring bitches, and they bad as fuck
Ass fat as fuck, with a little ol' waist
I ain't want the whole meal, just a little ol' taste
Should have looked both ways 'fore I crossed you
I guess I never thought I could've ever lost you
Now I'm out stuntin' with this bitch, who ain't about nothin'
While some nigga learnin' all the shit I taught you
Damn, guess you deserve that, a new start
But deep down you know we grew apart
Long before I broke your heart
If I lost your respect, I'm just hopin' you don't look at me as you somethin' you regret
Can't say we didn't try though
[Chorus]
I tried, you tried, we tried (Can't say we didn't try)
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I got your message I been meanin' to respond, know it's been a while
Apologies, I ain't been around
I wanna kick it, but I know that shit is different now
And times have changed
Let me know if I'm out of bounds, are the lines the same?
I mean ya, lookin' good, yeah you still got it
Been reminiscin' and I'm not sure how I feel 'bout it
Now we can say that all good things come to an end
But we know each other way too well to pretend
We went from friends to somethin' much more
To breakin' up to makin' up and fuckin' once more
Second chances, we gave enough
'Til finally, we gave it up
But some days I be wakin' up and wantin' one more
But what for? Maybe it's just the weather
We break each others heart's, so maybe it's for the better
Holler whenever, 'cause you always got a friend in me
And nothin' lasts forever, least we got these memories
You can't say we didn't try though
[Chorus]
I tried, you tried, we tried (Can't say we didn't try, hey)
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
I tried, you tried, we tried (Can't say we didn't try though)
(Can't say we didn't try, hey)
All of the times that we had together

Lyrics:

[Verse]
Yeah
My mind state feel like the crime in the summertime
Higher than average, lot of cabbage
Thank God I never abide by the established
Guidelines that keep niggas inside of fabrics
Commissioned by the state, I skate by the masters
Like "Yoo-hoo" with a new-new ridin' passenger
Shout out Oak Cliff, I'm 'bout to fly to Dallas
Decade from now, I might just buy the Mavericks
What up, Mark Cuban?, I am only part human
Half-man, half-amazin', plus, I'm good at math like I'm Asian
Hate to use stereotypes
But that's light compared to what a nigga get from Caucasians
No race-baitin'—treat the beat like PlayStation
Reportin' to you live from the International Space Station
I'll prolly vacation on Mars
The flow is out of this world, and so is the bars
Blow the facade right off of your squad
Lil' rappers, I love you, but you ain't shit 'til you got offers in Prague
Look that shit up, a book, nigga, pick that shit up
Expand your vocab, I'm givin' out toe tags for no cash
All summer long plus three seasons after
Please CC a rapper, tell him meet me
It's absolutely imperative that my heat speak to rappers
The problem with this game is this weak sea of rappers
I'm the answer on the low, I'm a cheat sheet for rappers
I came up round AC to DC adapters
Plug talk, what I'm really sayin' is a shame but
My niggas move 'caine like HBCU Kappas
Whole town full of CC Sabathia's
You think niggas gettin' fat pitchin' crack? Not really
This is not the eighties, don't be silly
Now we push pills and sell heroin to Billy
Now Billy momma want the judge to pardon his addiction
How many black addicts that got caught up in the system?
With no sob stories on your prime-time television
I can smell a blatant contradiction, man, listen
Don't want to fuck up my vibe
Let's end it on a positive note, come see me live
KOD—album of the year, undebatably
My cadence be the greatest we've seen
Since the late MC whose name was The
Notorious—Dreamville stacked like the Warriors
Winnin' back to back, next up to bat
Is my nigga Bas, after that, Jiddy-J.I.D
That's a New York City kid, plus ATL
Me, I'm from the 'Ville, but I know them towns well
Before I had a deal, I was givin' niggas hell
Now I'm givin' niggas deals and they givin' niggas hellYou might also like52Embed

Release Date: May 14, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-c-l-o-s-e-lyrics
Song Description: On the penultimate song from J. Coles sixth studio album, The Off-Season, the North Carolina native reminisces about a former friend who succumbed to the temptations of drugs and gang life. The narrative culminates with the apparent murder of J. Coles friend as he laments over their deteriorating friendship.

The track is self-produced and pays homage to the late MF DOOM, pulling samples from his November 2003 instrumental, Valerian Root.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah
Close
Ville-matic, one, one
One, one, one-two, one
One-two, one, one-two, one
One-two, one, one, listen

[Verse]
Close, I stare at my dreams as they approach
Gotta be patient and trust in God, He the coach
Temptations are taking a shortcut, but I don't
'Cause I ain't tryna be a almost, when I get it, I'ma float
Gone are the days we was close
Now when I see you, I look at you just like a ghost
A shell of your former self, so caught up with that dope
Two niggas singin' two diffеrent notes and you know I gotta coast
Nothin' but a dollar and some hopе
Up in NY, but damn, what hurts me the most
You was a good nigga, we knew each other's folks
Now you gotta ride around with the toast and you keep that shit close
'Cause niggas plottin' on you since you chose
To roll around with the candy paint on spokes
You know 'Ville niggas don't like it when you boast
You know twelve be takin' notes and they watchin' you close
But maybe you don't see 'em 'cause the smoke
Cloudin' your vision from every cigar that you toke
Plus the lean you sippin' which started as a joke
Got you now fiendin' for your next dose, meanwhile I'm so close
Don't even give a fuck that I'm broke
'Cause in my mind I'm rich with shit I done wrote
Therefore I'm convinced that this is supposed to happen
And in time I'ma blow, they gon' label me the GOAT
How long has it been since we spoke?
Last night I jumped up from my sleep, I was soaked
Call it a nightmare, the scene that awoke me
Involved you and niggas I ain't know, they was creepin' up close
I saw the heat tucked in they coats
You didn't notice 'cause you was busy countin' dough
I tried to yell, but nothin' came out of my throat
Niggas cocked back the hammers and you froze, in your eyes I saw hope
Hope of a better way to cope with the pain
And the scars, than the lean and the coke
And I swear in that moment I wish we were still close
Maybe I could've saved you, but no, trigger squeeze, gun smoke
I opened up my eyes with a jolt
Heart pumpin' like Usain Bolt
Reached for my phone, missed calls and a text message note
From my mama sayin' you just got smoked, damn, this life is no joke

Title: Can I Holla At Ya
Release Date: February 12, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-can-i-holla-at-ya-lyrics
Song Description: From the 5-song EP Truly Yours, consisting of leftover songs from the process of J. Cole recording Born Sinner, his sophomore album.

The song revolves around Cole returning to his home and each verse represents Cole speaking to someone from his past. The first verse is directed towards a girl he used to date, the second verse addresses his step-father, and the third verse is aimed at an old friend.

People have compared the concept of the song to 2Pacs Holla At Me, which has a similar title, and the flow has been compared to Pacs flow on I Aint Mad At Cha. Pac also gets two nods in the second verse, one explicit and the other a bit more subtle.

Cole prominently samples Lauryn Hills To Zion.
Lyrics:

[Sample: Lauryn Hill]
One day, I'm gonna understand...

[Intro: J. Cole]
Hey
Can I holla at you?
Let me holla at you
[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Special, never forget the day I met you
We was destined for each other like a, son to his mother, or a
Sister and brother, man this bond is deep
We go a couple years and don't even speak
But know it's love though
Could never let 'em dirty your name
I got the utmost respect for you
Came back home and had to check for you
Word round town is you locked down
Some older nigga snatched you up, gave you a rock now
Damn, hey could it be—
She like, "If you was me you wouldn't wait for me
Living fast and wouldn't mash the brakes for me"
Big city slicker nigga on a higher track
Bigger now but when she send a letter always write her back and
Time revealed, she feels that she settled too soon
While she see me go for mines and she admire that
We speak about time as if we could just buy it back
If only it was that simple, damn I miss you

Can I holla at you?
Can I holla at you?
Ayy, let me holla at you!
Yeah, I know it's been a while, but—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You betrayed me
The day you played my momma you played me
Can't believe I let you in my heart, nigga
I shoulda, followed my instincts, a stranger in my house
Only five years old but sensed danger in my house
I was too young to scrap you, but damn if I ain't want to
I'm blowing up fast and I hope these words haunt you, uh
Thirteen years, knew you more than my real pops
Put me on to 'Pac and all the rappers that killed cops
Who woulda thought that you'd leave my momma high and dry
Last words to a bitch nigga "why you lie?"
Feeling bitter so these words might seem jumbled
When you left I watched that lady crumble
I know by now you probably a old man
But I still I feel I won't be satisfied until we throw hands
For all the ass whoopings
Heard you tryna talk, tell that punk don't call me
You ain't shit, and I'm scared it rubbed off on me
[Chorus: J. Cole]
May I holla at you?
I'll holla at you
Ayy, let me holla at you!
Yeah, I know it's been a while but ain't no better time than now
Can I holla at you?
Can I holla at you?
Ayy, let me holla at you!
Yeah, I know it's been a while, but—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I heard you on that shit, I hope it ain't true
Was hard to holla at you last time I came through
Could barely recognize you, naw nigga this ain't you
'Cause you ain't lookin' like that nigga that I once knew
And plus you act like you don't know me
We was homies, now you call me by my rap name
See me do my thing so you expected me to act strange
Ain't holla but you on my mind nigga, huh
I don't forget the good times nigga
White tees in the club, jeans baggy as fuck
Sometimes I look back on my life, that was the happiest stuff
We had potential to be monumental, 'ville mentality
You know that old kill-or-be-killed mentality
I look at where you at now it's a, real fatality
'Cause where you s'posed to be is on top, close to me
Chasin' hoes like the old days, but now we overseas
Dawg, congratulations on your seed
Yo, my nigga
[Chorus: J. Cole]
Can I holla at you?
Can I holla at you?
Ayy, let me holla at you!
Yeah, I know it's been a while but ain't no better time than now
Can I holla at you?
Can I holla at you?
Ayy, let me holla at you!

Title: Return Of Simba
Release Date: May 23, 2011, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-return-of-simba-lyrics
Song Description: 3rd installment of the Simba series (the prequels being Simba & Grown Simba). This is an Elite production that samples 3 songs, the most obvious one being Runaway by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. .

J Cole seems to have responded to Drakes subliminal Jay-Z diss on this track (am I just being paranoid?)
Lyrics:

[Intro: Mufasa & Simba]
One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here, and will rise with you as the new king
And this will all be mine?
Everything
Everything the light touches

[Intro]
In my freshest J's, I ain't slept in days
Girl, you gonna make me late undressing me
Know you ain't seen me since yesterday
But, see, I got a date with destiny
Cause this the summer that our life change
Hov asked me, "Is you ready for it?"
I looked around at all his nice things
Told him, "Nigga, you already know it"
Bitch, I'm the man of the year
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Straight through this bitch
Bitch, I'm the man of the year

[Verse]
What you 'sposed to do when the OG niggas don't get it?
Lost what was once theirs but they won't quit it
Homie, it's a new era, middle finger to the suit-wearers
Lemme show you how to move in a room
Full of dudes that don't got a fuckin' clue how to do this
Prolly worked with Cube, so to them, this a Rubik
My President is black, but my jeweler's still Jewish
So you know it cost, he makin' a killing off me
Red diamonds he designing got me shining
Spotlight cover my body, my chain blinding
A cop light runner, they wanna but can't find him
Me and Hovi Hov, out on the same island
Took the whip to the other side of Jamaica
Seen how he was living, said "I gotta get my weight up"
Formulated my plan, motivated by dreams
Parlayed with my mans, motivated my team
Ced said, "Look, my niggas, we got a foot in"
Being good is good, that'll get you Drew Gooden
But me, I want Jordan numbers, LeBron footin'
Can't guard me, Vince Lombardi, John Wooden
Garbage? Hardly, you niggas silly like Chris Farley
So like him, you'll be gone too early
Mama hands together like 6:30
And Cole keep a thick bitch I like to call Big Shirley
All my '90s niggas is gon' get it
18 and under, that's prolly gonna take a minute
I'mma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
I'mma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
At the time of this rhyme, 5 years 'til I know 30
Cole World in the summer brings snow flurries
This next shit is in no way to boast
But my city love breakfast, 'cause niggas had toast early
Coach had us doin' jumpin' jacks
Then sent us to the water fountain after runnin' laps
My nigga went and grabbed his bookbag, threw it on his back
And brought it to me just to show me he was fuckin' strapped
We was twelve years old, how was we to know better?
I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up
Live by the trigger, 'cause no father figure
Means you don't got a nigga comin' 'round to guide a nigga
All you got is mama bringin' home these rotten niggas
Blowin' reefers, all the teachers do is ride a nigga
So this is who I speak fo'
To give the young niggas somethin' they could reach fo'
You better dream, boy
Yeah, I stunt, but I'm a li'l more realer
When it come from the heart, don't it feel mo' iller?
Watch my flow go bananas, I'm a li'l gorilla
So pardon me, man, y'all gon' have to pardon me
They say I rep that 'Ville too much, but that shit just a part of me
It's flowin' out through my arteries, who hard as me? You JV, I'm varsity
No field trip, ain't hard to see, this real shit, you R&B
Seen a movie wit' yo' bitch in it, and listen it, was starrin' me
(Woo!) That boy Simba crazy
Hotter than Ike Turner temper, you December, maybe
And though you wish me well, I know deep down you wish I'd fail
It's Judgment Day, I'm here to give you pussy niggas hell
And some food for thought, I can serve a plate
With dessert to take, with dessert to take
Yeah, I heard the hate, but the wait is fuckin' over
It's like I'm fuckin' Oprah, well worth the wait
Maybe over your head, I'm ahead of my time
Niggas scared of my future, I know they dreadin' my prime
Cause I only made classics, now what that take? Timing
Cole under pressure, what that make? DiamondsYou might also like28Embed

[Intro: J. Cole]
This for all my niggas in the city
But this shit really for Queens though
Really for Queens though, ya know?
Big city of dreams, motivated by schemes
Getting money regiment with my gettin' money regime
Ya nah mean? Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
New York Times, come listen to these New York rhymes
A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be Kings
Getting to the money, it seems, by any means
As I, watch it all pan out, try not to stand out
Fish out of water, yet an official reporter
Up here, life is a bitch, I blow a kiss at her daughter
In the city where niggas will leave your shit outta order
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news
Shot {censored} brother in the head, thank the Lord he ain't dead
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened up once
My nigga visibly stressin', a mess, he smoking his blunt
What could I say? I can't relate to that, all I do is pray for that
This the city of God told me go and make it at
I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that
Grab a paper, hey kid, you gotta pay for that

The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been nowhere if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces on the train mane
New York, New York

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hop on the F train, took the express train
Skip that local shit, my vocals sick, that's how success came
Once kings, now we pawns in this chess game
Wall Street got black slave blood stains
Which means, we built this city
And never got scraps while the devil got fat
In fact, reparations for niggas in desperation
Fuck money, get my kid a real education
Blood money spills, had a real revelation
Southside make you realize there's still segregation
Don't wanna preach, I'm just thinking out loud
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking 'bout how
My motive, to lead my niggas to paradise
Imagine the world free from pain and we no longer scared at night
Far from the crime, the blind leading the blind
We don't make it primetime 'til we dyin'
[Chorus: J. Cole & 50 Cent]
The New York Times
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been nowhere if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces on the train mane
New York, New York
[Verse 3: Bas]
How I go from selling reefer and plates
To eating steaks with Cole and playing FIFA with Drake?
Shoulda been in the States, property of the Jakes
Now I'm plotting on profits and properties on the lake
Let me properly integrate you to it
Show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it
Them niggas talk a lot of shit but they ain't been through it
I done been up in everything, cars you never seen
Cities you never heard of, from the streets where they murder
Police observe us 'til they reach the verdict
Kill 'em all, fucking kill 'em all
If you can't send 'em to the pen, send 'em to the morgue
Send 'em to the Lord, fuck it, send his broad
Hundred shots through the dark but they never hit my heart
Nigga, bitch nigga, take a pause
Hundred shots through the dark, you can never hit my heart
[Chorus: J. Cole & 50 Cent]
New York Times
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces, on the train mane

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Cole World, the new Nat King
If I ain't the illest nigga, I'm his new vaccine
Really more like poison when his New Jack Swing
And my bed is like a deck of cards — two black queens
A nigga don't like me, he just a fucking hater
What you made last week, I just tipped the fucking waiter
What that feel like? Tell me what that feel like?
Nigga fuck your Twitter, bitches follow me in real life

[Interlude]
Welcome back, ladies and gentleman, to a brand new season. Dreamville, Cole World. So much has happened in our time apart
I can't wait to share it with you all in due time. Did you miss me?
I know I missed you. Can't believe these niggas ain't rap on this shit man…

[Verse 1]
Heard niggas got beef
Then they see me on the street, and don't speak
Heard niggas dropping songs every week, but they weak
Yeah, I heard about your deal, hope they keep the receipt
Heard niggas out there saying I would be Memphis Bleek
Well, how you feel when that nigga got mills?
And you sitting, commenting, discussing on how you feel
Bout another nigga shit, or another nigga chips
Meanwhile I'm on the strip, putt puttin' wit ya bitch
Cut something in the 6 then dip to 160
Bitch don't fuck with me, trust nigga I'm sick
Can't tag me, fuck nigga I'm it—watch this
With my heart on my sleeve I bleed pardon my greed
I plead insanity, with a side of vanity
How can it be I blew up singlehandedly
Nobody handed me shit
Granted though, I planned to be rich
Understandably, funny how I talk so candidly
On cameras but won't holla at family only randomly
After a few drinks come our realest convos
My handle on my thoughts used to be as ill as Rondo's
Screaming fuck whitey, forgetting I'm still mulatto
Ay reverend, will I get to heaven, he said, "Hell if I know," shit
Stay scheming, day dreaming, chain gleaming
Name should be Abe Lincoln 'cause I cannot tell a lie though
All facts in fact, been all that
Before Kenan and Kel swallow the key to my cell
Which means, I got an impossible lock to pick
And if you want my spot, you gotta go through lots of shit
Nigga, Cole the truth, you the opposite
I be tryna figure out why I cannot commit
With who I've known for years, is it hoes or fear
Meanwhile she wonder if the one she chose is pure
No cure for the cold, rather Cole the cure
Them last lines was more honest than your whole career
Nigga, you a phony, only got few homies
I prefer lonely, you rap niggas don't know me
Staying to myself, not concerned 'bout my health
I'm a mothafucka and yo baby mother is a milf
Couple years ago they had a nigga sitting on the shelf
Now they tell me, "Man you like the realest shit I ever smelt"
They say, "Boy you got the belt"
"Plus you better than so-and-so!"
I keep it modest but inside I already know it though
Yea thanks my nigga, yea thanks my nigga
I deserve but nah this ain't Tank my nigga
Leave the party like I just robbed a bank my nigga
Bag full of money, fuck yo debate my nigga
'Cause two years ago and I ain't make it, I was pissed
But you care a little less about a list when you rich, nigga
When you rich nigga…

But that's not what we came here for. We didn't come here to brag; we didn't come here to boast, to stunt. We just came here to flex. Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate your patience. I assure you, it'll be well worth the wait. In the meantime, if I can get right back into it though. Check it…

[Verse 2]
How many Kanye beats do a nigga gotta murder
To prove my mind's further, hater nigga converter
Took kids to Carowinds which I'm sure you never heard of
'Cause I didn't tell the news or the Fayetteville Observer
I don't do it for the press, I'm blessed, I made it out
Sitting on this plane, my biggest thing to complain about
Somewhere between yesterday and now
I done lost my jewelry, Rollies, chains, almost lost my cool
But see, I just left kids who ain't got a fucking thing
'Cept a lot of fucking problems and a lot of fucking pain
And here I go bitching 'cause my Jesus piece missing
Got a feeling housekeeping finally caught a nigga slipping
Eyes wide open, they just found a pot of gold
Now lil' Julio is somewhere shining on you hoes
But that's how it goes, fuck it I'm still breathing
Like my lil' nigga Jaheim, we here for a reason
[Outro]
That's my lil' man Jaheim. He said, "Cole, can you shout me out on a song?" I was like, "I don't know man," but in my mind I knew I would shout him out though, you know—Fayettenam, 2-6. Dreamville. We from a different world. Cole World…

Lyrics:

[Intro: David Ruffin]
Sometimes I think about it
And my poor heart wants to die about it
Woooooo about the sweet sweet love I lost
And the way I got double, double crossed
By a guy who was my friend, I see him now and then
But I pretend I'm doing fine, when I'm about to lose my mind

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Nigga I grew up fast, then blew up fast
Money fallin out my pockets I got too much cash
Can't fit nothin in her pockets she got too much ass like goddamn
Well if you must ask
We from the school of hard knocks but your crew cut class
Half white but don't think I got a Klu Klux pass
When I'm up in the V, police be fuckin with me
No sir no license all I got here is this fuckin degree
Move along cocksucker ain't nothin to see
Unless you talkin blockbusters, you niggas is not Russell
You more Diggy - me I'm more Biggie
No diss to the young boy im just rappin get bored quickly
Just to make up for that line invite him on tour with me
Show him the game let him finagle these whores with me
Run through they doors with me, hit the Ritz-Carlton for the night
Leave him there with two dykes probably change a nigga life right
What up Vanessa, I loved you that one semester
Thanks to my profession I balled like Uncle Fester
Thinkin about the board I use to have above the dresser
Half the shit I wrote down I did it, its old now got
New goals, plus my money on Manute Bol
Funny how my old highs is suddenly my new lows
Tired of every chick sayin she models before she swallow
So I only fuck with hat tricks, bitches with a few goals

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Not even slightly interested in what ya opinion is
I gotta greater purpose then a hater purpose
I'mma stack paper, hustle just to relax later
Serve niggas and bring change that's a waiter's purpose
Look how I made em nervous, niggas is shakin, I know they fakin'
Okay you a killer right, and Miss Cleo is Jamaican
And Bob Marley is Haitian and me and Beyonce datin'
And Jesus Christ be hatin, got mad love from Satan
For fuckin Sanaa Lathan while Meagan Good is waitin'
I'm the deadbeat father of your little brother
In other words goddamnit I'm a bad motherfucker
It's Cole, it's only right I brought back the soul
Y'all got way too electro, damn near techno
Halfway homo, way too metro
Hennesy XO, Cole flow special
Style like Tribe Called Quest meets Death Row
Learn somethin boy, grow yo ass up
Cheap nigga if you was liquor I'd probably throw yo ass up
Matter a fact if you was grass I'd probably mow yo ass up
Last call for you old niggas go and pour yo last cup
[Outro: J. Cole]
Yea, yea, yea yea, Cole World
This nigga Ib is fuckin'...he's a bitch
He told me to talk shit to y'all niggas, so I'mma talk my shit
Dreamville in the building
I know what y'all want me to talk about, what y'all want to me to discuss
But we'll get to that later; them bitch ass niggas...
My nigga Big Sean in the building

Lyrics:

[Intro]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night
So we could do whatever you like (Like, like, like...)
Hey, hey!

[Verse 1]
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact, y'all need to practice that more
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantle
Dog my shows be off the handle
Take the proceeds go to gamble
Ha, bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealin' with some real-life shit
She be askin' "When?"
Bitch! When I feel like it

[Hook]
Cole World (World), Cole Life (Life), Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy! Ha, ha, ha!
I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here, hey!

Uh, turn up the 808's for me (Woohoo!)
Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me (Woohoo!)
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story (Woohoo!)
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry
Bitch, I made this in the crib, watchin' Belly
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck could niggas tell me?
They say I'm takin' long, I tell 'em patience is a virtue
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew
See, when you're spittin' so real
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal
Got 'em' feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' 'bout diplomacy
And they ain't got a clue, my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be
I think they scared of me, and they should be

[Hook]
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy! Ha, ha, ha!
I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here, hey!
Hm, ok, we're outta here (O-o-o-key-key-key)
I think it's safe to say we outta here
(We outta here, we outta here, we-we-we)
We outta here
I think it's safe to say we outta here
[Outro]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night (Night, night, night)
A hell of a night (Night, night, night)
So we could do whatever you like (Like, like, like)
Hey (Hey, hey, hey...)

Title: Kenny Lofton
Release Date: April 30, 2013, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-kenny-lofton-lyrics
Song Description: Kenny Lofton is one of the better stories to have emerged from Major League Baseball. He was definitely known for his speed, which J. Cole attests to in the hook of this song. But if you dig a little deeper into the career of Lofton, youll know that he was frequently picked up by teams for just a one-season deal, and he always came through. He was an extremely clutch player, but was never shown true love by any organization. One could argue that the Cleveland Indians respected him the most, as he had his two lengthiest stints on any team with the Tribe.



Why does all of this matter? J. Cole alludes to it on this track, that he believes hes good, he believes hes made it, but no one is showing him the proper love yet.

Get em Kenny!
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Hurt, to think that you lied to me
Hurt, way down deep inside of me
And it breaks my heart...

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Get paid a pretty penny for my thoughts
I'm Hardaway with grammar, I'm hot
They only care 'bout a nigga when he handle the rock
Or when he dishing the pill, or when he grippin' the steel
Bailing out my brother, tell the lawyer "get the appeal"
With the flick of the pen, write the check and he out
Two years later he be at my shows checking me out
Know he proud of lil bro and how my records be out
Flashbacks to childhood when he was deckin' me out
Now it's clear lil 'Maine is the best MC out
Hands down, flow water, can't drown
My flow father, go harder, Cole smarter
Shout out to fiends in Queens, I'm team no daughters

[Pre-Chorus]
I seen it all at this young age
The only thing left to do is die and hit front page
Should I knock on wood and pray like God forbid?
These hoes be poppin' pills, these niggas be poppin' shit, bitch
You might also like[Chorus]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton, you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball, mane
And it breaks my heart
The world’s a stage, I'll just play my part

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Just caught fire like a young Richard Pryor with unforgettable quotes
They only care 'bout a nigga when tellin' a joke, or when he's sellin' his dope
They tell the reverend "Man, I rather get to heaven with coke
Then live in hell and be broke"
Shout out to black man who beat the odds by yellin' for hope
Today he asked if I could Twitter y'all and tell you to vote
My nigga, how could I, knowing what I know
It's a game of charades, masquerade for the dough
Read the teleprompter these niggas is actors on the low
Yeah I voted for the nigga 'cause he got the best show
Like I got the best flow
On your mark, set, go
Mama got us out the hood but we still ghetto

[Pre-Chorus]
I seen it all at this young age
The only thing left to do is die and hit front page
Should I knock on wood and pray like God forbid?
These hoes be poppin' pills, these niggas be poppin' shit, bitch
[Chorus]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton, you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball, mane
And it breaks my heart
The world’s a stage, I'll just play my part

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
I said, you wouldn't know the truth if it was right there in your face
See I can't explain the feeling when the feds surround your place
In that PJ Rosé, I drink that shit by the case
Like somebody pray for me, Reverend Run, Pastor Mase
See I do this for my homie he got caught with a soft eight
When I say a soft eight, yeah that's two less than ten
If they let him out today he gon' do it all again
Say he lost the first time it won't stop until he win
Street life will have you drunk, I'm talkin Seagram’s Gin
Yeah we screamin' Scarface, but we all know how that ends
Every word is like dope, you can snort it like lines
If I said it, then I meant it, they reciting' every line
If I had to write a book, it would be the Life and Times
Every verse is that work, you can weigh it like a nine
You see I lost a lot of niggas and it broke my heart
Life is staged, I just played my part
Haha, yeah
[Chorus]
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton, you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball, mane
And it breaks my heart

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Na, na, na, na, my nose runnin'
Got my shades over this
The whole skyline of the city's right in front of my face, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm in the zone this year, it's all fire nigga check my attire
Your worst fear is confirmed, your reign at the top expires this year
No application, I'm hired this year
This a dedication to that bitch who slashed my nigga tires, oh yeah
I knew about you, bitch I knew about you
Came up on a good nigga, he ain't have a clue about you
Tried to tell that nigga, don't trust that bitch as far as you can smell her, nigga
But you live and you learn
On these road to riches niggas bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you cross turn into bridges you burn
You're bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you.. fuck it you don't hear me
Look, ayo, I walk along this long harbor of life and sit on the piers
Reflect on my pain and shit on my fears
Should I feel an ounce of guilt that I outdid all my peers?
Or write my name in the sky and show them niggas I'm here?
This one is for the history books, picture me shook or failin'
This is revenge of the dreamer
Misery took a million of my niggas' hopes from 'em, don't even know some 'em
No more, the coke numbed 'em, no suicide notes from 'em
They killin' theyselves, slowly killin' they cells
Five iPhones dropped, my nigga still in the cell
He said he found God, shit, I doubt it, to each his own
Whatever keeps you strong to get up out it, we need you home
Cause see a war's goin' on outside, I 'bout cried
When that boy that the cops shot died, my mouth wide open from shock
Sick and tired of hopin' it'll stop
This pen the only hope that I got, I open up shop, and break out
You might also like[Chorus]
Got what you want, I got what you need
My heart on my sleeve, watch me bleed, I break out!
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga
Fuck what you think, cause if your shit don't stink
Nigga my shit won't sink, cause it can't, I break out!
I gotta break the fuck up outta here
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga

[Verse 2]
War stories, got tour stories
Pop-four-whores-on-the-top-floor stories
Niggas know, every verse is worth a brick of blow
Just a seven figure nigga got the game in figure four
I know at times I'm hypocritical, you niggas dig it though
I fuck until my dick be sore, leave bitches walkin' pigeon toe and break out!
On to the next bitch, homie
Your new chick—that's my ex-bitch, homie—in fact, I'm still logged in her Netflix, homie
Just make sure she cook you breakfast, homie
Her bacon slammin' but her eggs get runny—funny
So many bombs, you'd think Flex get money from me
Cole world but my neck get sunny
Now I don't fuck around with hoes from reality shows
Or blow-up dolls, 'cause I don't like havin' sex with dummies, love me
No disrespect meant, honey, this just a compilation of my observations
While trapped in this God-forsaken nation
Shit, but since we makin' conversation
I've been thinkin' me and you would make a bangin' combination
I know that you mad, I know what I said
But my dick be arguin' with my head, are you with the bed?
Well if so let's break out!
[Chorus]
Got what you want, I got what you need
My heart on my sleeve, watch me bleed, I break out!
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga
Fuck what you think, cause if your shit don't stink
Nigga my shit won't sink, cause it can't, I break out!

Song Description: J. Cole drives around and gets high. Hes got a lot on his mind, ok?

Original instrumental: Must Be Love by Cassie
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, nigga
I'ma go ahead and murder this shit
Voice gone and shit, I think it's gon' make it sound a lil'
A lil' ill, just a lil' iller
Yeah, Fayettenam, nigga, yeah

[Verse]
Carolina blue kicks, pedal to the metal
Feeling like a puppet and the Devil is Geppetto
Letter to the ghetto, hold your head high
You can pick apart my raps, I ain't told ya nan lie
My world a little darker like a fuckin' tan line
Go on look for a better nigga, girl, you can't find
Fine young man with an old man mind
No time for the chick who fucked the whole mankind
Aw, no ma'am, I'm an old land mine
I been waiting to blow up for a long damn time
Now I'm armed and I'm, Fayettenam's finest
Carolina's savior, marijuana blazer
Only on occasion 'cause my mind be racin'
Lost in my thoughts so my eyes be Asian
Thinking how these rap niggas gotta be fakin''
Whole style obviously copied, pasted
Plagiarized swag, may arrive last
But when it's all said and done, I'ma be ahead of them
Way that I describe it, prescribe a nigga medicine
Way that I be fly, I be higher than the Jet-a-sons
Moving on up, nigga higher than the Jeffersons
All about the Benjamins, bad chicks, send 'em in
Basic hoes, toss 'em out, can't even get Waffle House
Hatin' niggas, chalk 'em out, go on, get the coffin out
What you talking about, lil' man?
My shit here burning, you not even lil' tan
I'm ill enough to kill cancer, baby, I'm chemo
Down in Miami and I'm throwed like Marino
Get a whole lot of you know and she bald like an Eagle
No, not on top but down there
She say she want to hop on top, girl, I don't care
You better get yours 'fore I reach mine 'cause then I'm throwing peace signs
If you a freak, I can take you to your peak
Girl, I do it to the maximum, Nissan
And I hope you a believer
I'm quarterbacking, tryna get you open like receivers
Far from an overnight achiever
Cole is like the leader of the new niggas
To tell the truth, I'm only fucking with a few niggas
If that, the rest of y'all niggas get lapped
I sit back and reflect on the rap game, I came from out of nowhere
Nigga, I swear them lames ain't know how to prepare
Got niggas shouting out the 'Ville, "I gotta go there"
Boy, don't you know you get shot over there?
I say my prayers 'cause this life ain't fair
A bunch of backstabbing niggas, hope the knife ain't there
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife ain't there
Yeah late at night, when I got the phone call and made a right
But my crib was straight ahead, shawty gave me head
Hit it then I quit it 'fore she even made the bed
Damn I'm no good, but damn it's so good
I'm picturing that body like a camera phone would
Something like Rihanna while I'm up in that V-gina
Type of chick that only dress in something that's designer
I could give a fuck long as there's something that's behind of her
Got the type of bumper make a dog wanna hump
Back to the topic, actually forgot it
Hoes, money, I'm the shit, oh yeah, I'm reminded
The way I put the words together, cleverly align 'em
These other rap niggas should never be a problem
You might also like[Outro]
And I'm ghost, nigga, yeah
Let me hear that, woo!

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, hey
Hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah, am I changing right before your eyes? Huh
Becoming someone you don't recognize
As if I was disguised, I'm on that shit as if I was the flies
I'm touching skies, no puffing lye
Man these songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Goin' finally give a nigga leg room in the whip
From a Civic to a 7, must've died and went to heaven
Like a passenger on 9/11, please go find a reverend
You see I promised that I'd never change
But that was way before I made the dough and met the game
Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow
And even white women want a nigga, Othello
I'm balling with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmelo
Now the crib got much rooms, Portobello
She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow
I sit your ass down like you was playing a cello
See, you niggas hated and I levitated further
Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder
So if it comes down, may the best man win
No sweat like a headband then, nigga

Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me

[Verse 2]
I'ma kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm giving life sentences
Like keep grinding boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I paid dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it, either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned it so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creeping out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth it for what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I'd give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke? You would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me?
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings 'cause now all the chicks feeling him
You gotta adapt though, I'm never going back
[Chorus]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
Hey, you know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
Hey, you know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me

[Outro]
I can't keep running away
I can't keep running away
I swear I'm coming back one day
Hey
What if I'm wrong
And I ain't got what it takes
Then all them people that was counting on me
Boy won't you climb down the mountain for me
Hey, hey, hey, alright18Embed

Lyrics:

[Intro: Daylyt]
Know what I'm sayin'
Lights off, lights goin', know what I'm sayin'?
Haha, uh
So soulful, don't you agree?
I do, yeah
Is it a room full of, full of mirrors or a room full of Motown? I don't know
Shoutout to Zordon, if you know, you know
(She makes the rain fall from my eyes) Yo
Ayy
You know that I do belie— (Man)

[Verse 1: Daylyt & Ab-Soul]
The criteria for this tier is just a open pride
Hope and cries, but so can I
I drop the unprovoken crimes
Pray to the heaven, God, with no disguise
We roll the dice and hope the soul unties
Reap the fruit with no bow tie
Sensitive Pisces, still thuggin', baby, ain't 'fraid to cry
Skinny, biggy, lens is tinted, ain't got no lazy eye
Heart of gold, almost sold it in Saudi Arabia
Quill told me the clouds ain't real, God gotta paint the sky
So I'm a student of Sophia Stewart, the Matrix ain't a lie
Tainted Gods fall from the sky
Tie in inception
When you wake inside this dream, you a weapon
Step in the cypher, know the beef real
Your life at stake, ages with each meal
Real estate of mind, you need equity? Let the beat build
Poison in my cup, I need to refill
I feel it in my gut, you niggas meek still
I inherit the Earth
Like three wise men pulled up to cherish my birth
They placed me in a manger, wasn't that major at first
But what a mess I'll leave, I'm the savior at work
I ain't sayin' I'm Jesus
Got the job of the messiah, Ty and Joe, we block all devils
Get y'all shovels, can ya dig it?
We gon' riot if y'all pick it
Sign of danger, oh, we anger from my past, can't get past that
We the last batch and the cause installed, we got Black facts
Grow a spinal cord or backtrack
The homies call me Batman, I'm the African Ben Affleck
Publishin' some other shit, like is something up with ASCAP?
It's training day, don't get your ass capped
Givenchy snapback with the rhinestones, you ain't never had that
Was at Saks Fifth with Doe, that's a double entendre
Everything I say is dope, is this a microphone or contra?
Bands in my pocket
See what they told Malcolm X to do with his hands?
That shit was out of pocket
Picked up shotguns that came in handy, wasn't no plan B
Kid gone, who can fuck with him? Knew them shots would muzzle him
Knew the blocks would puzzle him
Let' go stupid because of him
Shells fallin' like Nephilim
Gilgamesh, who can fuck with him? (Perfect)

Oh, y'all thought we was done wit' em? Huh
Y'all must be stupid, we finna go dumb on 'em
Just keep your ears open like Dumbo and them
Good luck to them, it's up for them
Piece of the pie edge, we gon' crumble 'em
Three fourteen on the guy head when we rumble 'em
Hahaha, on second thought, that's enough for them
Nah, you gotta chill, bro (Hahaha)

[Interlude]
She makes a tear fall from my eye
Ah, man, I wish it was the rain
You gotta reach out to them
She makes the rain fall from my eye

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Uh, prayer hands for the land where they sprayin' pellets
And turning your mans to an angelic
Being and freeing him from this crammed, hellish hole
The weather's cold from jealous souls that fanned fellas
I danced as well as Chris Breezy when the bullets start strayin' careless
I won't let him Swiss cheese me, got plans that I can't fail at
Seen plenty bodies trembling, resembling Cam Reddish
So full of potential, but never given a real chance to develop
My head envelops the pen, these ain't fan letters I craft
His album dropped, it was trash
I litter it like I can't spell it
Is you a demon or is that demeanor for the 'Gram? Tell us
They plead the fifth, I'm seeing hints of a trans fella
In cancel culture's vicinity, he's no killer, trust me
Beneath his chosen identity, there is still a pussy, period
Blood spillin' monthly, rather weekly as a myriad of bodies drop
Where bricks get karate chopped to maximize the dojo, comprende
I wonder, will my friends make it past the pearly gates, so we could kick it
But based on what their sins say, probably not
Hit lick after lick like a lollipop
You niggas take a lie detect', the polygraph'll probably pop
You know my zone, I live here at the top
Right now, I'm home alone, Macaulay cot
I keep the shotty cocked in 'case somebody plot to rob me of this godly spot
Jermaine monstrous
Like that nigga off Jumanji, they know how he rock
All these bodies I done caught, I should probably stop
Nah, fuck that, I willingly venture into a den full of lions
On some kill or be sent to a funeral home facility
To test my ability with this thrilling agenda
But it's hard to meet my match when my raps ain't really that tender
Since birth, the kid knew his worth
Never wallowed in sorrow, the game he dispersed
In these verses, bring a gillie potential, a milli' from pencils
Never will my ability cripple
Now please, hold yo' L like you guardin' Philly's young center
Quick to leave a chick curved
It's only one of me, but bet it's like six hers
In my mobile device, you feel the motive in these quotables, right?
Cole is the nicest, but ain't shit about these vocals polite
Focusin' like bifocals while I'm walkin' on tightropes from a height
You folks'll only get this scope from a flight
How many "Verses Of The Year" this year is Cole gonna write? Uh
[Outro]
You know that I do believe, she
She makes a tear fall from my eye
Falling, I
You know that I do believe, she, I2Embed

Title: Intro (KOD)
Release Date: April 20, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/J-cole-intro-kod-lyrics
Song Description: J. Cole sets the stage for his 5th studio album in this opening track.

He briefly explained on Twitter that there isnt an obvious or completely logical explanation or meaning of the album title.

https://twitter.com/JColeNC/status/987113255226179584

However, the three meanings behind the acronym KOD are interconnected.

The kids on drugs are the kids who are currently in the rap game. The majority of young MCs nowadays are on the drugs discussed on this album, especially Xanax.

The King that has overdosed is Edward, Coles stepdad,. Hes personified as the king of the rap game, and he is trying to convince Cole to join the kids in this drug-infested epidemic. Edward is comfortable with this reality, but J. Cole chooses to fight against it throughout the album.

J. Coles goal is to kill these demons. He wants to kill King Edward because of how he glorifies and endorses the high usage of drugs with these kids. Cole is also looking to motivate the young generation through a substitute of a healthier lifestyle aside from illicit substances.

Finally, the track at the end concludes these steps. This is why the last track, 1985, signifies The Fall Offit will be the death of not only this drug-oriented rap game in contemporary hip-hop, but it also marks the death of King Edward.
Lyrics:

Can someone please turn off my mind?
My thoughts are racing all the time
There is no reason or no rhyme
I'm trapped inside myself

A newborn baby has two primary modes of communication
Laughter, which says, "I love this"
Or crying, which says, "This frightens me, I'm in pain"
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely
At the bottom of the hourglass
Lies sand that represents the past
In which all of my demons rest
I'm calling out for help
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I hit the weed, I told myself the last time would be my last
I don't trust my own niggas, now my mind racing fast
Got my foot up on the gas, got a hundred on the dash
If the police run up on me, I ain't stopping for they ass
Boy, you know my L's dirty, if they stop me, I'm goin' to jail surely
I'll be next to my brother in the cell, no bail for me
"Man, let me out, send me back to bitches that smell purdy"
And all I gotta do is call once and she there all ready
Yeah, buddy, can't you tell I'm goin' through hell?
I don't even open my mail
I'm in the shower with a soap and the towel, I need cleansing
Bad bitches all on the prowl, they need Benzes
Pussy niggas running they mouth and we ain't flinching
They names ain't even mentioned
I got dreams bigger than your whole team
You niggas so broke, yet somehow you so green
I guess it's envy, started with a penny now I'm getting plenty money

[Chorus]
Huh, and one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh

[Verse 2]
Look kid, it's raining outside boy, fuck an umbrella
Niggas banging outside boy, they guns'll dumbbell a nigga
Tired of telling niggas that's deceased "Rest in Peace"
We tired of only having just a piece
And fuck policing, they killing niggas, what's the reason?
His daughter starving and she fucking freezing
So no wonder why he fucking squeezing
They out here bussin', leavin' niggas stuck and bleedin' on the flo'
Bullets wet you like it's semen on a ho
Breathing slow man, I'm in hell
One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail
Lord knows he meant well
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal
Some shit that's darker than the tints up on the windshield
Uh, welcome to Sinville where niggas on base
Shit is looking like an infield, high as a Sprint bill
What you think? That's the reason why this ink in my pen kills
Phony niggas until they are extinct, bitch I've been real

[Verse 3]
Them old niggas sayin', "Cole the wrong one bringin' the city shine
All he ever doin' is paintin' pictures of crime
Tellin' stories of pain, paintin' pictures of dope"
Bitch if you listenin', I'm paintin' pictures of hope, huh
That boy in class embarrassed because he broke
Hopin' today he won't be the butt of somebody's joke
See me, I lived it all from dirt-poor in a trailer
Worried about my mother and never trustin' my neighbors
To middle-class with a backyard and my own room
To bein' the only black kid in my homeroom
Academically gifted and followed my own rules
Was runnin' the streets, hey ma, I'll be home soon
Was out chasin' hoes, was out hoopin'
Them niggas wasn't ballin' but yet they was foul shootin', uh
So meet the newest role model who don't know how to fake this shit
Never sold a rock and look, I made it bitch

[Chorus]
Huh, and one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
[Outro]
Girl it's been so long, I've been gone from you
But you ain't gotta worry 'bout the thangs I do
It's hard but the thought of you would ease my pain
Girl I promise they gon' know our name, uh
Ain't seen you smile in a while
But I been dreamin' 'bout you

Song Description: This Cole World track talks about the desire to give up in three different situations  personal, societal, and fictional
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Look, I just shed tears, homie, and I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
When I say a minute, I mean years, man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears, fam
'Cause as I left 'em I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, 'cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it 'cause I ain't know no better
Though I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame 'cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowing through our veins is the same
My mama left you, and maybe your anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only called monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin 'Bari
Maybe I should be telling you, "fuck you" 'cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help but...
You might also like[Chorus 1]
Break down
I break down
Can't help but break down
I break down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit, man
It's fucking with her body, now she sick, damn
I wanted a big house with the white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothing like real life
You made a milli off of serving hard white? Yeah, right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, ain't heard the cops be shooting niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bulletproof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruiting niggas
We trying to stand tall when it get too crucial niggas

[Chorus 2]
Break down, we break down
We break down, we break down
Break the break down
[Verse 3]
Yeah, he's serving time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know
His daughter 25 pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt she love him, yeah that's for sure
But temptation stays 'round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know? Never know
And so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freaking, but them niggas holler, but she never speakin'
But tonight I see the devil creeping
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons
Damn! She doin' the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please
[Chorus 3]
Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Please
Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Don't break down
Yeah, don't break down
Don't break down
Don't break down
Uh, break the break down...

[Outro]
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Break, break down
Steady break me down...

[Intro]
Yeah, ugh, yeah

1-2, 1-2, 1-2, ugh
Yeah, ugh
Yeah, ugh

[Verse 1]
Miss High Profile, caught you shoppin' on Canal (Yeah)
I guess it makes sense, it seems phony as your style
Your hair and your nails just as phony as your smile
Fake eyelashes, you drew your eyebrows
It make a brother ask, do you pride yourself?
Your makeup like a mask, tryna hide yourself
It seems on the outside, you thinking you the shit (Uh-huh)
But there's a soul that's inside that you ain't even knew exist
So you so out of touch that the world mistreat you
Rich niggas fuck you and broke niggas beat you
Hope that this will reach you when you understand
That your value ain't determined by another man
'Cause right now you let them brothers get the upper hand
And you just tell 'em "Go deep" like Cunningham
And you just let 'em OD like Len Bias
And that pussy so good he let his friends try it

[Chorus]
Losing your balance, yeah uh
Losing your balance, yeah uh
Losing your balance
Girl, you losing your balance uh, yeah
Don't slip and don't fall, uh
Just a get a grip my nigga, hold on, uh
Don't lose your balance (Yeah, ugh)

I look around at my city, this is Sinville
That boy 11 years old and can inhale
Sometimes I ride around wonderin' if we in hell
And why do cops love to throw a nigga in jail?
I'm 'bout to lose it, I just had another friend killed (Damn)
Over some bullshit this cycle's like a windmill
I had a convo with my soul, I asked it "When will
This shit change?" It said, "Boy, just use them pen skills"
And so I write this for my niggas on the corner
Love you 'cause you my brother, so I feel I got to warn ya
This shit ain't set up for a young brother to advance
On that note, you niggas playing right into their hands
Damn, better get yourself some goals (Uh-huh), you niggas better dream (Yeah)
I know the hood raised you but it's bigger better things
And for those that passed, I need a moment of silence
Sssssshhhhh

[Chorus]
Yeah, and don't be losing your balance, uh
Don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance
My nigga, don't be losing your balance, uh, yeah
So don't slip and don't fall
Just a get a grip my nigga, hold on (Yeah)
Don't lose your balance (Ugh)
Don't lose your balance (Yeah)
[Verse 3]
Ugh, I got a thing for this little mama
She do it to me plus her brain is for real, I'm a
Sucka for love I guess, won't catch her up in the club 'cause she ain't into that (Nah)
Kind of chick that rather rent a flick and get intimate
Say she never fuck with thug niggas, only gentlemen
And yeah that ass is fat but what's better is her intellect (Uh-huh)
Other men would sweat her when we walk past
Can't even blame 'em, did the same when I saw the ass
Matched with the thin waist, brown with a slim face
Love the conversation and the kicks was like a sensei
Now she got me chillin' with her all around the clock
My homies beefin' 'cause I never come around a lot
Keep on telling me I changed and things ain't the same
And ever since she came around I never want to hang (Ugh)
They tell me that it's foul how a chick would make me switch
But man I can't help it dawg, her mind got me whipped

[Chorus]
I think I'm losing my balance, uh
I think I'm losing my balance, yeah
She got me losing my balance, uh
She got me losing my balance, yeah
But I, I won't slip, nah, I won't fall, ugh
Just a get a grip and hold on, ugh
Losing my balance (Uh-huh)
