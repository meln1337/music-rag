Artist: Lil Peep, Alternate Names: Gustav Elijah Åhr, Gustav E. Åhr, Trap Goose, Lil Bo Peep, Peep, Bo Peep, Gustav Åhr, Gustav Elijah, GOTH ANGEL SINNER, Hockiefan40, Lil Jeep, Beamer Boy, Gus Åhr, Gus E. Åhr, Gus Elijah Åhr, Lil Peep Shawty
Artist Description: Gustav Elijah Åhr (November 1, 1996 – November 15, 2017), better known by his stage name Lil Peep, was an American rapper and singer-songwriter from Long Beach, Long Island, New York.

Lil Peep’s music is known for its slow, melodic, and melancholy “emo” sound and its often loud and gruff voice. His lyrics include themes of suicide, addiction, abuse, and relationships. He is known as a pioneer of the “emo-rap” genre, which combines moody lyrics about depression, loneliness, and relationships with modern trap beats. Peep’s vocal style ranged from rapping, singing, and screaming. Peep’s biggest influences include Gucci Mane, Crystal Castles, and My Chemical Romance.

Peep himself was also known for his unique, somewhat flamboyant, fashion sense, and appearance. His hair was more often than not dyed bright pink, he often wore brightly colored, eccentric clothes. He had dozens of tattoos, including the word “DADDY” below his collarbone, the anarchy symbol on his cheek, and “Crybaby” above his right eyebrow.

Peep first started releasing music on SoundCloud under the alias TRAP GOOSE. Peep first gained major recognition online following the release of his 2015 mixtape LiL PEEP; PART ONE, which went viral on SoundCloud and included his breakout songs “Star Shopping” and “the way i see things,” which gained him much popularity in the underground hip-hop scene, especially in the then-emerging “goth rap” subgenre. In 2016, Peep released HELLBOY, which got much popularity with a mainstream audience and further pushed Lil Peep into the mainstream light. Finally, in 2017, Peep released his first album ever, Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 1.

Peep was part of SCHEMAPOSSE (from 2015 to 2016). SCHEMAPOSSE founding member JGRXXN recounts how peep became involved with SCHEMA, on his song “November 56” as well as releasing this screenshot that shows the first hints of Peep joining SCHEMA.



Peep later became a member of GOTHBOICLIQUE after being introduced to them by prominent underground music blogger The Internet Hippy.
https://twitter.com/lnternethippy/status/976896914359808001. GOTHBOICLIQUE was the final group Peep would be a member of before his tragic death on November 15, 2017.

During Peep’s years in the SoundCloud rap scene, he managed to build an impressive network of friends and collaborators. This was in part due to his time in the RVIDXR KLVN off-shoot group SCHEMAPOSSE. During this period, Peep began collaborating with many notable artists such as Craig Xen, OmenXIII, Ghostemane, and many more. This network was only made larger when Peep joined the emo-rap collective GOTHBOICLIQUE. Peep also became close friends with English rapper Bexey after he edited the music video for the song “Live Forever” off the EP of the same name. The two even shared an apartment in London. They collaborated on an album together called Romeo’s Regrets. At the time of his death Peep had songs with over 100 different artists and producers, and had become close friends with many people including superstar Post Malone.

Late into the night on November 15, 2017, Lil Peep passed away due to a suspected overdose of Xanax that had been laced with the dangerous drug Fentanyl. He was 21 years old.

Years after his death, posthumous music is still coming out from Peep as songs he was producing before he died are starting to get released (like “Spotlight”). It was even announced by frequent collaborator and close friend, Smokeasac, that the follow up to his debut album Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 2 which was released November 9, 2018, almost a year after Peep died.

2019 saw the release of EVERYBODY’S EVERYTHING, a documentary that chronicled Peep’s life, from his upbringing in Long Island to his rising status in the underground scene and the rap industry, up until his tragic death. The soundtrack to the documentary was released the same time as the documentary, to which it consisted a mix between unreleased songs and re-releases of older songs from Peep’s previous discography.

Since then, Peep’s mother and his team have continued to share his legacy by re-releasing his older projects onto streaming platforms. From time, fans would get a taste of new Peep music released, with the first one being High Fashion with producer Harry Fraud, following the release of EVERYBODY’S EVERYTHING. Then on September 8, 2023, after six years of anticipated waiting and numerous delays, as well as facing near cancellation, Lil Peep and ILoveMakonnen released their only collaboration album, DIAMONDS.

Title: Star Shopping
Release Date: August 17, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-peep-star-shopping-lyrics
Song Description: On Star Shopping, Lil Peep talks about his feelings towards his relationship with Emma Harris who is slowly starting to become impatient with him. He understands why she feels this way and is attempting to let her know how much he cares for her. He informs her that he just needs some time to get everything sorted out.

The song features Peeps melancholy vocals over a sad, guitar-centered beat by Kryptik that samples Never Mess With Sunday by Yppah. On October 17th, 2017, during a live concert in Minnesota, Lil Peep told the crowd he had written Star Shopping in his mothers bedroom while high on heroin.

The song was unavailable on most streaming services due to a copyright issue with the sample, with Yppah himself claiming that Peep had ripped off his song. However, on April 19, 2019, it was officially uploaded to streaming services (presumably after negotiation and clearances). The re-release of the song caused a resurgence in interest and the songs popularity boosted. It re-entered and climbed the Genius Top 20 Hot Songs chart.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (Yeah)
So much more than perfect (Yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me (Yeah)
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces

Song Description: Bayerische Motoren Werke, widely known as BMW, is a German luxury car brand founded in Munich, Germany that produces automobiles as well as motorcycles.

Many BMW car owners refer to the German brand as Beamer and Beemer. Interestingly, Bimmer is the correct term for the cars and the former are used to refer to BMW motorcycles.

Nonetheless, on Beamer Boy Peep expresses his fondness of the established automobile brand, speaks on how people are appearing to view him differently now that he has fame and money and makes references to one of BMWs most recognizable and iconic models, the Z3, which was most famously featured in the 1996 James Bond movie, GoldenEye.

Title: ​nuts
Release Date: December 1, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-peep-nuts-lyrics
Song Description: On nuts, the two artists talk about their past love experiences on a fast-paced beat taken directly from the repertoire of Lil Peeps friend and former collaborator Willie G. Gus departs from his usual grunge-sounding rap to bring a more sung touch that contrasts with the other tracks of LIVE FOREVER, considered to be one of Peeps coldest, slowest, and darkest mixtape.

The girl Peep refers to in his verse is his ex-girlfriend Emma Harris. She and the Long Island native met in elementary school and spent most of their schooling together before breaking up shortly after leaving high school.

Although it is one of the last LIVE FOREVER tracks still available on Peeps SoundCloud, nuts streams soared in summer 2020 after the song went viral on TikTok.

The song was re-released on all streaming platforms on December 17, 2021.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: rainy bear]
I can see it in your eyes that you wanna get out
I can see it in your eyes that you need it right now
That you need it right now
That you wanna get out
That you need it right now
That you wanna get out

[Chorus: rainy bear & Lil Peep]
Yeah, I just wanna hear the sound
Drive our Camaros out of town
Baby, we could leave right now, woah
Yeah, I just wanna feel alive
Baby, take your time
Smokin' on this loud, woah

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Girl, you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
One kiss, then we fuckin', I just can't get enough
Put it on me, that's the best part, baby, the trust
Trust me, I got nothin' for you other than love
I remember eatin' pussy on the back of the bus
I remember gettin' nooky 'til the Sun came up
All the places that you took me, no one came with us

Title: Awful Things
Release Date: August 15, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-peep-awful-things-lyrics
Song Description: Awful Things is a song by the late Lil Peep, featuring Lil Tracy, another member of the LA-based emo hip hop collective GothBoiClique. It was produced by frequent producers IIVI and Smokeasac, who are known to help produce other songs from Peep such as Benz Truck (). The song was listed as the 3rd track on Lil Peeps debut studio album, Come Over When Youre Sober, Pt. 1.

This was the song that broke the friendship between Lil Peep and Lil Tracy since it was revealed how Tracy wrote most of the song but was only featured for some seconds in the music video.

The music video was released only two days after the release of the album. In the video, it shows Lil Peep having a girlfriend at school. At the end, he catches his girlfriend kissing another guy on the neck, in which he gets furious, and the school catches on fire. At the end, it depicts both the girl and Lil Peep in a fiery pit of hell, in which they reconnect.

Lil Peep died less than three months after the video was released, and exactly three months after the album was released. He died on November 15, 2017, after a laced Xanax overdose while on his tour bus in Tucson, Arizona, where his last show was scheduled to be.

You like attention, I find it obvious
She makes it obvious for me
She feels the tension
It's just the two of us, it's just the two of us, tonight
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
I get it, girl (I get it, girl)
I get it, girl
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
I get it, girl (I get it, girl)
I'm not the one

Lyrics:

[Verse]
I got a feelin' that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So let's laugh a little before I'm gone
I've been dreamin' up this shit for a while now
Got me high now
She don't love me, but she's singin' my songs (Oh, no)
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back, and a bullet in my brain, I'm
Clinically insane
Walkin' home alone, I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Spend it gettin' high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now, I'm so high, I be fuckin' with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the mornin' with the blinds closed
I could show you everything I learned
While you were away from me

[Chorus]
Runnin' away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you, no

Title: ​right here
Release Date: November 15, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-peep-right-here-lyrics
Song Description: Right Here is a single by Lil Peep, featuring  american rapper and producer, Horse Head, who is also a friend of Gustav and one of the founding members of the LA-based emo hip hop collective GothBoiClique which Gustav is apart of.

This song was recorded near the time Peep had left Skid Row, Los Angeles and moved to the Echo Park  neighborhood.  The main part of the song (the hook) is talking about a difficult situation Peep experienced, where hes saying to his girlfriend that hell always be here for her, although he wont be physically there. Gus is repeating his meaning because his girlfriend cant accept that.
During Horse Heads verse, hes trying to get his girl to leave with him, which doesnt seem to work due to the sixth line, where she doubts him and his motives.

On the occasion of the 5th anniversary of the song, November 15, 2021, it has been officially re-released on all music platforms with a new cover art.

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Baby, how you doing? I know you're not doing the best, but I'm here, I'll always be here
Tell me if you need me and call me if you feelin' alone 'cause I'm here, I'm always right here
Tell me that I'm dumb, I love to get numb, I know that I'm young, but I'm still right here
I don't give a fuck, I love who I love and girl, you're that one, so I'll wait right here (GothBoiClique)
Baby, how you doing? I know you're not doing the best but I'm here, I'll always be here
Tell me if you need me and call me if you feelin' alone 'cause I'm here, I'm always right here
Tell me that I'm dumb, I love to get numb, I know that I'm young but I'm still right here
I don't give a fuck, I love who I love and girl, you're that one so I'll wait right here

[Verse: Horse Head]
Baby, I'm leaving, I'm not taking anything but you
Picture us escaping
In the background of the photo I see you
I remember the time, I remember hearts sewn together with twine
Just remember that I am still right here
And if you doubt me, that's just fine
And when it comes clear, I will be waiting right here
Just tell me if you need me and I will meet you right there

Title: Life is Beautiful
Release Date: November 7, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-peep-life-is-beautiful-lyrics
Song Description: Life is Beautiful is the third single off of Peeps posthumous album, Come Over When Youre Sober, Pt. 2. The song is a remix of a previous Lil Peep song known as Life which was released as one of his first songs and was apart of the Feelz EP. It was produced by TeamSeshs own Drip-133.

The songs lyrical content dives into themes of life, death, and depression. Peep sings regarding the negative aspects of life while also recognizing the beauty of life. Bouncing back and forth between these two ideologies, the song finally settles on its initial depressing theme with Peep imagining a death alone in his room from a drug overdose.

The songs lyrical content inadvertently was reflected in Peeps life when he died on November 15, 2017 from an accidental overdose on fentanyl and xanax. The album itself was released just under a year after Peeps death.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Working every day, now you're bleeding through your cuticles
Passing through a portal as you're sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep your cool at your grandfather's funeral
Finding out eventually the feeling wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothing like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they're sayin' it's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fucking kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, the type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the morning, now you doing the impossible
Find out what's important, now you're feeling philosophical
When I die, I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical

And if you ever need a friend, then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I try suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room

[Outro]
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful181Embed

Title: Gym Class
Release Date: April 1, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-peep-gym-class-lyrics
Song Description: Gym Class is a single by Lil Peep released on March 30, 2016. The track was produced by Brobak, a frequent collaborator with Peep. The song touches on high school nostalgia, drug usage, and shaky relationships.

The cover art features Inari Fushimi, the main character of Japanese manga series Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha.

The song, along with Star Shopping and others, had been taken down from YouTube and Soundcloud following Lil Peeps death due to Brobak sampling an instrumental that had been copyrighted beforehand. However, many fans had saved the songs and started reuploading them to the sites.

After settling issues with the sample on April 11, 2019, Gym Class was officially uploaded to streaming services.
Lyrics:

Now I'm seein' cash flow, I can be an asshole, yeah, I know
But it's all good 'cause I let her spend my money, though
Playboy bunny, though, shawty look like a pornstar
I know she love me 'cause she fuck me in her sports car
I pull up on her, tell her that we finna go far
Drop top, smokin' thrax, lookin' at the stars
Gettin' high, takin' bars 'til we on Mars
I can make the ground move like I'm Avatar
Now I'm faded on my own in my bedroom
Now I'm lookin' at my phone, should I text you?
I just wanna sex you, I just wanna bless you
Baby, I'm a priest in the underworld, guess who
Lil Bo Peep with a brand new flow, too
Lookin' at my teeth like you never seen a gold tooth
Never in the streets, 'cause I never leave my home
If you wanna live a dream I ain't comin', bitch, I told you

Title: ​feelz ♡
Release Date: May 16, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-peep-feelz-lyrics
Song Description: Using romantic lyrics and monotonous flows throughout the song, Peep distracts the listener while he dresses up a slightly creepy and off-putting demeanor. These stalkerish tones can only be noticed after looking past the surface of the song.
While it may seem unsettling, it is not unusual for a person to display behavior or feel a way that could be perceived to be creepy  when they are enthralled by another person.

As well as toxic city from the same EP, feelz includes a music video that was deleted after the release of the song. The clip is considered as lost, and the possibility of its resurfacing is uncertain. On May 21, 2022, the video became available on the official Lil Peep channel.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
(Cowabunga, dude!)

[Chorus]
I love you to the summer and back, it's not the winter
But you've frozen my heart, and got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back, the love I give her
Is kinda creepy, but fuck it, she orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone, my little mama
Is mad at me at the moment, know she's such a prima donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'

[Verse]
I will always be here for you, and when I'm dyin'
I pray to a higher power, next to you is where I'm lyin'
Would you fuck me right on the floor? I'm feelin' naughty
I wish to explore your features, secrets hidden in your body
I been feelin' like I don't have a choice, my only option
Watchin' me through the window as I whip up this concoction
Don't you ever take your life out of mine, I'll fuckin' kill you
Take you out to the bayou in the cabin with the mildew
And I'll leave you there for someone to find, my little angel
In your deepest darkest corners and I'm lovin' every angle
Baby, you got nowhere to hide, I'm comin' for you
Your parents could never fathom the levels to I adore you
It's like Palestine up inside my mind, a deadly war zone
Quakin' inside my boots as you waken my every hormone
I'll give you everything I've got till I'm gone, and that's a promise
Unless you didn't want it, then for you I'd be dishonest

Title: ​absolute in doubt
Release Date: June 10, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-peep-absolute-in-doubt-lyrics
Song Description: Absolute in Doubt is the 4th song off of Lil Peeps Crybaby mixtape, which features fellow GBC member Wicca Phase Springs Eternal. The song discusses relationships falling apart, being pushed away and like the title of the song being in doubt.

[Intro: Wicca Phase Springs Eternal]
Runnin' up that hill, you pushin' me back
Wish that I can make you want it bad
I don't need it though
(I don't need it though, yeah)

[Verse 1: Wicca Phase Springs Eternal]
Sometimes you make me wait and make it like a plan
Wish that you could help me understand
Why? 'Cause I don't know (I don't know, I don't know)
Sometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest
Sometimes I hold it back, other times I'm blessed
Other times I want more, you put me in debt
I want you like so alive
Wanna be like so inside, wanna be like
For me want you to be more into it than this
For me I want more than you seem to wanna give
I see passion in the way you turn your back
Money and the ice, I put upon your wrist
There's a silhouette inside, a lucid dream
I project myself on you, then back to me
There's a reason that she doesn't call me back
It is the way, it is the way it really seems
There's a vision of an altar now, me and at once
I'm passin' on and out
(And out, and out, yeah)

I could do anything I want to
Bump Lil Peep, when I die, I'ma haunt you
I could live forever if I want to
I could stop time, but I never wanna do that again
Nothin' worse than losin' a friend
And the feelin' you get when everybody that you love ain't around
I really gotta get away from this town
I'm just waitin' for a wave and I'll drown
Satan lettin' me down
I just wanna help you see, you should run away from me
Baby, I'm a drug and I don't wanna hurt you
No, I'm not gonna hurt you, girl, not at all
I ain't gonna set you free, all you gonna get from me
Little bit of love and a little virtue
If I hurt you, I'll end it allYou might also like111Embed

Title: ​white tee
Release Date: May 17, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-peep-white-tee-lyrics
Song Description: white tee is the first collaboration between Lil Peep and Lil Tracy (fka Yung Bruh). As he just got out of prison, a friend of his told Tracy about him being mentioned in the fourth EP of the Long Island rapper, California Girls. Appreciating that shout-out as much as the EP, Tracy contacted Peeps friend and producer NEDARB to schedule a first meeting between the two rappers. On the day Peep and Tracy met, they wrote white tee.

Noticing how positive the feedback from the audience was, the two rappers decided to shoot a music video. It is in front of Brennan Savages garage, which was at the time occupied by Peep and the Schemaposse, that Killstation recorded the whole footage in one take. white tee is released on the next day and quickly gains popularity, as Tracy said in an interview for Pitchfork magazine:

Then the next day or so after this shit dropped, it was like, 100k, 200k, 300k, 500, 600k. Then it started a whole avalanche.

The instrumental, produced by NEDARB NAGROM, heavily samples Such Great Heights by indie pop duo Postal Service with some added hi-hats and some heavy-hitting 808s.

In 2018, Wicca Phase Springs Eternal revealed that NEDARB asked him to get on the song but he refused because he thought the Postal Service sample was too obvious.

You are the dark and you are the light
I steal the look when you're not with me
I wrote the book on feeling empty
Why did I ever take a chance on you?
I made you feel empty like the drugs that you do
You told me that you love me, that's not easy to do
But girl, don't tell me that you love me if you're just gonna leave
Don't tell me that you love me, it means nothing to me

Title: Better Off (Dying)
Release Date: August 15, 2017, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-peep-better-off-dying-lyrics
Song Description: Lil Peep shares the Live Fast, Die Young lifestyle that he lives, through his use of drugs and flexing his money.

This lifestyle does not cater to his relationships with other people as well. His story with his on-off girlfriend Layla (aka toopoor) is further evidence of the downside to this lifestyle.

Toopoor further explains her relationship with Lil Peep in a No Jumper Host Chat, where she goes in-depth about dealing with the breakup and the underlying soulmate-bond she still has with him.

The song first appeared on the internet in March of 2017, where Lil Peep performed it at a live show as an unreleased song. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFGWbtMMJtc

The track uses a guitar riff which, sounds similar to the one from Final Fantasy X.

R.I.P Lil Peep.

[Intro: Better Luck Next Time]
Spoken words were meant to last, but the picture faded fast

Now not even your lips can I touch
I'll cry for another eyesore
And think about our first kiss by the tree and how it meant so much to—

[Verse: Lil Peep]
Nobody knows the me that you do
Gonna take some, gettin' used to
And I think I'm getting through to you
But all that shit I put you through ain't right
And I know that I'm barely ever home
But I think of you on the road
You know I think of you on blow
It's me, Lil Jeep, she don't keep not a memory of me
I'm a creep, I'm a freak, that's why nobody's friends with me
I used to wait in my room for a single sign from you
Said, "I hate you," 'cause I knew that you would never love me too

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Wicca Phase Springs Eternal & Døves]
You'll only see us in the back
GothBoiClique, all black
I knew love once, it's hard to forget
I thought of you and nights spent
When I'm backed against the wall
I thought of her and highly
'Cause she answered when I called
I want her to wanna hurt me
And I miss 2013 love songs
And I'm so lost, under club lights
In the all black, GothBoiClique

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs

[Verse 2: Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, Døves & Both]
Fucked up in the back of the club
Cast a sigil in the back of the club
I got scars on me, no love
Light a candle and I pray for Døves
And you're fadin' away, like the pill under my tongue
We seriously never even touched, it sucks
I'ma put your name in my skin, mix the ink in my blood
It's so fucked
So tell me what is love
If I ever had it, if I ever had it
Did I really want it?
And why can't I remember?
I cannot remember

Into the dark, I only want what's best for you, baby
I reach out to you, but slowly
If there's passion there, then show me
Fast, hard, it's a slow drug
And I swear that, but it's true love
These are true lines

[Verse 4: Døves]
Saw you in the back of the club again
And we just started textin' again
And now you sendin' pictures to my phone, like I just can't resist
I'm tryin' not to let you feel missed (Tryin' so hard)
And now we're in the bar, like 6 PM
And now we took a bottle to your bed
Listenin' to Slowdive, eyes like so-so red
And I can't stop starin' at the back of your neck

[Bridge: Døves]
And you think you can make me love again
I swear that I will never feel a thing
Hollow shell, quiet hell, but you're so into me
Screamin', "Why don't you love me back?!"
'Cause it's GothBoiClique, 'til my lungs collapse
[Chorus: Lil Peep]
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up

Everyone doubts me
But I'ma make it all come true, and I do it for you

I wasnt there. I would go, sit there for 45 minutes, be like, I cannot take this. My high school was a closed campus, so we werent allowed to leave, so I had to hop a 20-foot fence to run away from these fucking fat security guards every fucking day. Literally. Theyd be like, You have in-school suspension tomorrow. I was like, Cool! I wont come. School was forced the whole time. Now its apparent that it was never very necessary.
Lyrics:

[Intro]

[Chorus]
Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke?
This lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go
Tell Heaven, "Don't wait for me"
Satan waitin' at the gate for me
I heard this bitch bump Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasin' bitches, I was chasin' dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Lookin' up at 'em like I never even knew 'em at all
I remember walkin' 'round in the hall
And then the bell rang and I took something then I couldn't recall
Makin' you cry the way that she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself, but I'm already in hell for it

[Bridge]
You used to love me then, I know it's not the same
But this is not the end 'cause everything gon' change
When I get that Benz, I'ma pull up in the rain and I'm gon' say
You wouldn't wait (Skrrt)

Then it's back to the flat ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
Till the reaper got a hold of me, then I would take my last flight
Wherever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks

So it seems every time that I die, I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker, I'll be ready for him

[Verse]
Got your glass slippers on, lookin' like you're Cinderella
Girl, what you sippin' on? Room spinnin' like propellers
Boy, what you trippin' on? How I make these pussies jealous?
Watch your girl sing along, say she want an acapella
I could give you what you want, till my body in the mud
King of the fuckin' swamp, name a drug, I got the plug
Shawty say my house is haunted, I said I don't give a fuck
Something's watchin' over me, it seen me smoke a million (SESH)

Then it's back to the flat ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
Till the reaper got a hold of me, then I would take my last flight
Wherever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die, I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker, I'll be ready for him56Embed

Lyrics:

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I don't wanna die alone right now, but I admit I do sometimes
These drugs are callin' me, do one more line, don't fall asleep
This is the song they played when I crashed into the wall
This is the girl I told that we could have it all

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
This is the life I made and I can't go back to fall
Back to fall, back to everyone I ever knew at all
Back to small town blues, and not a clue of what's goin' on
Back to old routines, and wedding rings and livin' at the mall, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I don't wanna die alone right now, but I admit I do sometimes
These drugs are callin' me, do one more line, don't fall asleep
This is the song they played when I crashed into the wall
This is the girl I told that we could have it all

[Verse 2: Lil Tracy]
Baby, I'm a drug, you're addicted to my love
I thought you were the one, but you were just another one
Call me Hellboy, I got fire in my blunt
Don't call me emo, don't call me punk
I'm a vampire, bitch, I'm countin' money up
I'm with Lil Peep, yeah, we hotter than the sun
You should tell your boyfriend stop tryna be like us
Tatted up my face, baby, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they sayin' it's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and then tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, that type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feelin' philosophical
When I die, I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical

And if you ever need a friend, then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room

Say goodbye to the nice guy, I'm wastin' my time
Givin' you rhymes, you gotta give me a dime
Before I do that again
And I ain't trippin', I'm high
In the trunk of the Benz is where my women reside
Where my women will die
I ain't got no friends, and I don't listen to y'all
I'm equipped for the fall
And the winter and all (Oh)
When the summer come
I'ma have enough to get the fuck out
I could buy a truck and drive that motherfuckin' truck out (Skrr)
Tryna buy luck, if you don't die that means you lucked out

Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Coliseum
Then I'm coming back here and I'll go to college and see what they know
And then I'm going to build things
I'm going to build air fields, I'm going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high
I'm going to build bridges a mile long
Well, are you going to throw a rock?

She cannot keep your cool, and you let her (And you let her)
I could keep my cool while I'm eating lemon pepper (Lemon pepper)

I could keep my cool under pressure like a fool (Like a fool)
Eatin' lemon pepper with a leopard, playin' pool
Damn, my man a cheetah, no, my man a cougar
I don't put tobacco in my motherfuckin' hookah
Straight sativa, motherfuck a Dutch
Motherfuck a twenty gram doobie with a crutch
When it come to that stuff, I cannot get enough
So I'm strictly smokin' wax, 'cause that kush gettin' tax, damn
Catch me smokin' dabs with your dad, why you mad, bitch?
Sad boys, money gang, I need me a sad bitch
My life ain't lavish, I ain't never had shit
I'm quick to take that dollar from your wallet if you have it
I be playin' Madden, smokin' weed and rappin'
Ain't no haters 'round him, on my throne laughin'

She said, "Why you got so many tattoos?"
So when your daddy see me out, he know I'm bad news
She said, "Why you always wear them black boots?"
'Cause the blood don't show, ho
I cannot, and I will not ever be stuck
It's just a short amount of time before your somethin' is nothin'
You've gotta do what you can do, for the public
I have to end the discussion, I hear the police comin'
I could smell them from a block away, aroma like bacon
They'd be jealous of the dirty money people be makin'
So then they point their finger blamin' but the judge is mistaken
Was that money for the takin'? 'Cause I witnessed them take it
But you ain't got no damn wallet, just a pocket of dust
And the lawyer they provided you will quickly choke up
And what you gon' do then? Spend your life in the pen'?
Because the cops are corrupt, are you gon' call up your man? (Damn)

I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)

Cut 'em up thin, cut 'em up thick
Pullin' up to the dope, that 9TD
Blood on my sink, blood on my feet
Throw the body bag to the bottom of the trash heap
I'm a creep, K-R-double-E-P
Only thing I really wanna be is six feet deep
When I wake in the AM all I really feel is a satire of the desire to breathe

Title: ​drugz
Release Date: December 19, 2015, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-peep-drugz-lyrics
Song Description: On drugz, Peep talks about his taste for several drugs over a loud beat, adding as usual a strong reverb on his voice.

Produced by John Mello, the track features a music video edited by a friend of Peeps, lil skil. It was shot in Cambridge, Massachusetts when the rapper was spending Christmas at his grandfathers.

Gus' girlfriend Emma and him went out in the middle of the night to have some good time while recording these moments, taking photos and videos. When playing this music on his phone at the same time, Peep found that the footage fit very well with it. With the night naturally blurring the image, it gives them a psychedelic aspect, as the rapper described them as sick.

It was first published on Peeps SoundCloud on the 20th of December, 2015 and on YouTube on the 15th of January, 2016. It was then re-released on all streaming platforms in 2020 for the fourth anniversary of the EP it is included in.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, I do them drugs

I don't eat food, but I take blues and I make news like five do
Get in my room, lil' bitch, I'm rude but they can't do what I do

[Chorus]

Pockets full of nothing, money in my bag
She told me I'm a druggie so I left and now she sad
Baby, that make you the junkie
You addicted to my lovin'
Even though I know you only love me 'cause I'm buzzin'
What's your motherfucking problem?
I think you need some help
I give you help, that's what I offer, but you left me on the shelf
I'm not a trophy, I got bitches on my belt
I put stitches on the pain, if you listen to me well
Pockets full of nothing, money in my bag
She told me I'm a druggie so I left and now she mad
Baby, that make you the junkie
You addicted to my lovin'
Even though I know you only love me 'cause I'm buzzin'
Oh, don't get too close, girl
You should know when to leave me alone, girl
Oh, don't get too close, girl
You should know when to leave me alone, girl

Title: ​move on, be strong
Release Date: September 5, 2016, URL: https://genius.com/Lil-peep-move-on-be-strong-lyrics
Song Description: After swinging between rap and alternative rock on 15 tracks, Lil Peep closes HELLBOY by providing an unusual mix between metalcore and trap. Containing classic lyrics, related to the rappers love relationships, it is his way of delivering them that make this track a must-hear crossover.

The Long Island native opens the track with an emo chorus, using a deeper voice and a more shouted singing. He completes each line of it with off-tempo ad-libs in a mid-range growl, a popular metal scream in heavy metal.

Besides his singing technique, his organization of the song is similar to that of a classic metalcore scheme. The addition of a riff between the two choruses is indeed a classic metalcore layout. It can most notably be found on the song that Yung Cortex and Smokeasac decided to sample on this track, Unholy Confessions from heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Real Trap Shit

[Chorus]
Move on (Move on), I'm gone, baby, I'm not comin' back, nah
Be strong (Be strong), you're wrong, girl, I'm not comin' back (I'm not comin' back)
I'd kill for you, I'd die for you, but I'm not coming back
Blood spilled for you, I get high for you when your new man's fuckin' wack (I'm not comin' back)

[Bridge]
I'm not comin' back
Move on
Be strong
Be strong
I'm not comin' back

[Interlude]
(I... I-I love you)

[Chorus]
Move on (Move on), I'm gone, baby, I'm not comin' back, nah
Be strong (Be strong), you're wrong, girl, I'm not comin' back (I'm not comin' back)
I'd kill for you, I'd die for you, but I'm not coming back

Produced by John Mello, the track features a music video made by local director, Jon Franois. As he got impressed by Peeps first music video for Live Forever, Jon decided to contact the rapper on SoundCloud. They came to an agreement and managed to produce two videos, this one along with the one for come around.

Gus was nervous about shooting a music video, he said hed never done it before, and didnt know if he could do it. Jon reassured him by saying that he would be able to edit the footage and make it look better regardless the outcome.
Gus began to wander around Long Island along two of his two friends who had brought him onto the set because Gus didnt have a car. These friends eventually inspired Jon and were a part of the video.

Bitch, you better leave me alone
First, I cut you off, then I cut you down
Shit go off, when I come around

(Damn son, where'd you find this?)
That head so fye
Make a grown man cry
If I take my time
And replace my crimes
With a face recognized

[Verse]
Screaming "Oh my my"
That head so fye
Make a grown man cry
If I take my time
And replace my crimes
With a face recognized
We can do anything
Worth remembering
One day I'll be sober too
One day I'll be over you
Screaming "Oh my my"
That head so fye
Make a grown man cry
If I take my time
And replace my crimes
While I make my rhymes
I can do anything
I can be anything
Anything I wanna be
I can never be a wannabe
