Artist: Crystal Castles
Artist Description: Ethan Kath and Alice Glass formed Crystal Castles in 2004. Their compositions include noisy, experimental and often beautiful dance music. Earlier lyrics are often vocal samples and generally meaningless. They took a turn towards social commentary in (III).

Two years after the release of III in October of 2014, Alice Glass announced that she would be leaving the band in pursuit of her own “personal and professional reasons.” Glass also accused Kath of abuse, rape and pedophilia.

Since the departure of Alice, Ethan Kath from Crystal Castles released “Frail” and “Deicide,” accompanied by news that Crystal Castles were getting ready to drop their fourth album, expected to introduce the mysterious “Edith” as the new vocalist for Crystal Castles IV. “Concrete” was released in July of 2016 with its accompanying music video, featuring the Kath’s new partner Edith Frances.

Amnesty (I) was released on August 19, 2016. The digital version of the album lists ten tracks, which were extended to twelve on the physical edition with the addition of “Kept” and “Their Kindness Is Charade.”

Songs:

Title: Crimewave
Release Date: August 13, 2007, URL: https://genius.com/Crystal-castles-crimewave-lyrics
Song Description: Vocals taken from the HEALTH song Crimewave.

This song served as the first single for both Crystal Castles and Health.

The lyrics may seem to differ between the Crystal Castles and Health versions due to Kaths extreme manipulation of the original sample, chopping up words to create new ones from the pieces, like the repetition of the word Eye that is reinserted later, changing the original sentence structure without recording new vocals. Crystal Castles havent released any original lyrics to this song.

Title: Not in Love
Release Date: December 6, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Crystal-castles-not-in-love-lyrics
Song Description: Not In Love is a cover of Toronto band Platinum Blondes song of the same name, with slight alterations to the lyrics.

The original album version featured pitch-shifted vocals by Ethan Kath, but they were was replaced on later versions of the album with vocals by Robert Smith of the British band The Cure.

At the time of the recording, Crystal Castles were friends with Mark Holmes, lead singer and bassist of the Platinum Blondes.

The song describes the evolution of an on-and-off relationship and the occasional hopes of the narrator that their partner may change their mind and come back to them while claiming at the same time that they are not in love, contradicting themselves in a way.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Robert Smith]
I saw your picture
Hanging on the back of my door
Won't give you my heart
No one lives there anymore
And we were lovers
Now we can't be friends
Fascination ends
Here we go again, oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Robert Smith]
'Cause it's cold outside
When you coming home?
'Cause it's hot inside
Isn't that enough?

[Chorus: Robert Smith]
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love

[Verse 2: Robert Smith]

Time has taken its toll?
Won't take you so far
I am in control

How can your love

Nuts and bolts for granted
Run, I can do it
As your bodies fall apart

Robotic love
I'm programmed to rust
AIDS robot
Is grinding iron bolts

[Verse 4: Alice Glass]
Robot hunks have one agenda
They wanna play with my placenta

When our cyborg parts are burning?
I know we're just diseased appliances

What will you die for?

Title: Celestica
Release Date: April 17, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Crystal-castles-celestica-lyrics
Song Description: One of Crystal Castles (II)s softer numbers featuring clearly audible lyrics, Celestica touches the themes of disillusionment with society, nihilism and grief. The production contains shoegaze and dream-pop elements, especially in its lifting chorus that explodes in reverb and glimmering synths.

The title refers to the Toronto company Celestica, that, according to Ethan Kath, would have allegedly used plastic an employee had jumped in to commit suicide to make their products. There doesnt seem to be any available records of the incident, so it is likely that it is simply urban legend.

Celestica was released as a single for the album with a music video directed by Rob Hawkins featuring Ethan and Alice wandering around an abandoned church, a forest and a graveyard, intercut with images of children playing violins.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
As we fall into sequence
And we're eating our young
Remain silent and still for modesty
When the splints have been broken
And they can't help you now
Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally?

[Chorus]
Follow me into nowhere
Woven with the utmost care

[Verse 2]
If I'm lost please don't find me
If I drown let me sink
We descended from no one
With a wink
Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally?

[Bridge]
When it's cold outside hold me, don't hold me
When I choose to rest my eyes coax me, don't coax me
When it's cold outside hold me, don't hold me
When I choose to rest my eyes coax me, don't coax me

Because all you do is cry
Wood ticks whisper to console you

Title: Alice Practice
Release Date: July 9, 2006, URL: https://genius.com/Crystal-castles-alice-practice-lyrics
Song Description: Historically the first true Crystal Castles song. The vocals are allegedly derived from a warmup exercise Alice performed in the studio (hence Alice Practice), that Ethan later built a song around.

In a statement made by Glass in 2017, she suggested this story was simply made up by Kath:

While recording our first EP, the recording engineer sexually harassed me while we were in the studio. Claudio laughed at me and pressured me to go along with it. He called our first single Alice Practice and said my vocals were a mic test. He concocted that story and told press it was an accidental recording, intentionally diminishing my role in its creation. It was another way of putting me down and preying on my insecurities.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Alice Glass]
Hi

[Verse 1: Alice Glass]
Scars will heal, soon
The dregs in us spent the earth down

[Verse 2: Alice Glass]
Better than drowning in a burlap sack
I live, as Alice, I die
Children shouldn't play with dead things
Foaming crows tear at their wings
Sad eyes cry crimson blood

[Verse 3: Alice Glass]
Drop it, it's dead
Wheels won't turn, they won't turn the birdy's head

Title: Empathy
Release Date: April 23, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Crystal-castles-empathy-lyrics
Song Description: The 6th song from the 2nd Crystal Castles album juxtaposes  a life cycle of a butterfly or just insects in general with the process of deterioration of a human mind by the modern society, the theme that is also adressed in the https://genius.com/Crystal-castles-celestica-lyrics and is central to the 4th Crystal Castles album, Amnesty.
  Every new form symbolises the process of  brainwashing. Eventually the individual stops fighting for his personality and becomes another cog in the govertnment machine, hence earning the empathy of the modern society.
Lyrics:

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Alice Glass]
You never got to bloom
They cut you from the stem
You're innocent at birth
Until you understand

[Pre-Chorus: Alice Glass]
Repeat every word that you say to me
They put you to use or put you to sleep
I can't tell you the difference between
An embryo or a planted seed

[Chorus: Alice Glass]
So many shades of white, so many shades of pale
I know what you hate, so I do it constantly
So many shades of white, so many shades of pale
I know how to cut a wound that will not heal

PLAGUE [(plg)]


A highly infectious, usually fatal, epidemic disease; a pestilence.
A virulent, infectious disease that is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis (syn. Pasteurella pestis) and is transmitted primarily by the bite of fleas from an infected rodent, especially a rat. In humans it occurs in bubonic form, marked by lymph node enlargement, and in pneumonic form, marked by infection of the lungs, and can progress to septicemia.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I need you pure, I need you clean
Don't try to enlighten me
Power to misconstrue
What have they done to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Infants in infantry
Rewrite their history
Uproot their colony
You're ripe for harvesting
Virgin cells to penetrate
Too premature to permeate
They can't elucidate
Never thought I was the enemy

[Chorus]
I am the plague
I am the plague

Title: Tell Me What to Swallow
Release Date: March 18, 2008, URL: https://genius.com/Crystal-castles-tell-me-what-to-swallow-lyrics
Song Description: This song describes an abusive relationship, possibly between a father and daughter, but Daddy could also signify the control the abuser has and the victims trust and love for him.

In October 2017 Alice Glass published a statement on her website describing the abusive relationship she had with her bandmate in Crystal Castles, Ethan Kath. http://www.alice-glass.com/cc/

This is the only song Glass mentions in her newer song, Without Love, which is about Ethans abuse.

The couplet stories a statement made by former bandmate Ethan Kath: people often gave [Glass] credit for my lyrics and that was fine, I didnt care,, which Glass refuted on twitter: for the record, i wrote almost all of the lyrics in my former band and the vast majority of the vocal melodies. This is also a direct reference to the closer of Crystal Castles self-titled debut album, Tell Me What to Swallow
Whatever you choose to think this song is about, its very gorgeous and I hope you enjoy it.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Alice Glass]
Through the wall, he threw me
I know he'd never hurt me
Daddy watch me sleeping
I've been praying for you, silently

Title: Child I Will Hurt You
Release Date: November 7, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Crystal-castles-child-i-will-hurt-you-lyrics
Song Description: A note of hope to end a bleak album.

This song is a reflection on how parental love and protection, especially in a world filled with the various evils and afflictions described in the rest of the album, will inevitably lead to children feeling hurt, betrayed, ignored, etc. at some point  given that parents are fallible human beings and tend to be overprotective and unable to see from their kids' point of view. This song is a simple acknowledgement of this fact, and asks that forgiveness be offered  for even when something was done wrong, it was done out of love.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Keep them locked away
Reduce them to strays
Clean their cuts and scrapes

[Verse 2]
Mercy we abstain
Hope you're entertained
Snow covers the stain

[Chorus]
Forray forever
Forray forever
Forray forever
Forray forever

[Verse 3]
Taught them with solace
They know a soft caress
To lower your defense

[Verse 4]
Hide all that you could
Done for the greater good

Title: Air War
Release Date: July 9, 2006, URL: https://genius.com/Crystal-castles-air-war-lyrics
Song Description: This particular reading is from Thema (Omaggio a Joyce), a famous electroacoustic composition from 1958 or 1959 by Luciano Berio experimenting with voice recording and editing techniques on magnetic tape. It is based on an interpretative reading of the poem Sirens by James Joyce.

Mezzo-soprano Cathy Berberian reads from the eleventh chapter from James Joyces Ulysses and it is her voice that can be heard on Air War. Thema (Omaggio a Joyce) is divided in two parts, the first one being Berberians expressive reading ponctuated by electroacoustic experimentation, the second, a non-narrative experimentation on tape. Kath is very likely to have sampled from the first section.

It is to be noted that in this chapter, the protagonist is losing their sanity.
Lyrics:

[Cathy Berberian]
Bronze by gold heard the hoofirons
Steelyringing imperthnthn thnthnthn
Chips, picking chips off rocky thumbnail, chips. Horrid!
And gold flushed more
A husky fifenote blew, blew
Blue bloom is on the gold pinnacled hair
A jumping rose on satiny breasts of satin, rose of Castille
Trilling, trilling: I Dolores
Peep! Who's in the... peepofgold?
Tink cried to bronze in pity
And a call, pure, long and throbbing. Longindying call
Decoy. Soft word. But look! The bright stars fade. O rose! Notes chirruping
Answer. Castille. The morn is breaking
Jingle jingle jaunted jingling
Coin rang. Clock clacked
Avowal. Sonnez. I could. Rebound of garter. Not leave thee
Sweetheart, goodbye!
Avowal. Warm

Title: Telepath
Release Date: November 7, 2012, URL: https://genius.com/Crystal-castles-telepath-lyrics
Song Description: Pitchfork: Telepath is one of the most straightforward tracks on the album musically, though there are no vocals. Did you considering putting vocals on it? Why or why not?

Ethan Kath: Alice did record vocals for Telepath, her voice is spliced up and sprinkled all over the track. The percussion is the most abstract on this song because its intentionally not in time with the kick and snare in a way which I find agitating. Its one of my favorite elements of the track.

Title: Mother Knows Best (2004 Version)
Release Date: April 17, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Crystal-castles-mother-knows-best-2004-version-lyrics
Song Description: The closing track on Crystal Castles' EP Celestica, this song was written several years before in 2004, alongside Seed and Insectica. An early acoustic demo was released on the same day as part of the Doe Deer EP on Bandcamp.

The lyrics seem to be from the perspective of a man or woman watching a cheerleader perform at a football game. They seem to be angry at the cheerleader for being good looking and possibly sexually provocative/enticing, and want to tear down her confidence, even if it takes violence in order to do so. The phrase Mother Knows Best seems to imply that the scenario is not something that actually happened and that it is instead a representation of the way that strict/abusive/know-it-all mothers often speak to their daughters  as if all boys are predators (like the narrator in the song), and as if all girls who do seemingly innocuous things like dancing or wearing a short skirt are tramps and have sexually transmitted diseases.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Feel her tight between my thighs from across the football field
It's victory that I smell inside, and the smell contains no guilt

[Chorus]
H-E-R-P-E-S, I can smell them through her dress
H-E-R-P-E-S, my daddy's wrong cause mother knows best

[Verse]
C-C-C is for cunt
There's a sickness inside that I need to harvest
Broken tramp, have you seen her?
Tried to love, but now I beat her

[Chorus]

Title: I Am Made of Chalk
Release Date: April 23, 2010, URL: https://genius.com/Crystal-castles-i-am-made-of-chalk-lyrics
Song Description: A 3 minute instrumental piece, final track on Crystal Castles' second record.



Its composed of distorted samples that sound like a cat meowing and a person (Alice, most likely) apparently screaming and crying for help. This, along with the watery distortions, creates the impression that someone is drowning.

The desperate atmosphere later gives way to soothing, peaceful synths. The screaming continues, though, probably suggesting the person drowning is giving in to death. Later, a sample of a small child calling their mom is heard, followed by what sounds like a loud, grieving NO!

Lyrics:

I, insectica
Fly thru dimensia
You give me more than meets the eye
You give me more than I can't deny

A thousand eyes thru your soul
A thousand eyes over me
Your power eclipses me
As I take my place beneath thee
I want to be in your colony
I want to serve your queen
For the venom through iron wings
Still beats in symmetry

Deathray deathray you're gay deathray

Straight to my heart
She tears apart
You have the right to remain in pieces
You have the right to own my heart
Now I am a part of your colony
Now I live to serve your queen
As the venom through iron wings
Still beats in symmetryYou might also likeEmbed

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I saw your picture
Hanging on the back of my door
Won't give you my heart
No one lives there anymore
And we were lovers
Now we can't be friends
Fascination ends
Here we go again, oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's cold outside
When you coming home?
'Cause it's hot inside
Isn't that enough?

[Chorus]
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love

[Verse 2]
Could it be that
Time has taken its toll?
Won't take you so far
I am in control
And we were lovers
Now we can't be friends
Fascination еnds
Here we go again, oh-oh-oh

Lyrics:

Bronze by gold heard the hoofirons, steelyringing imperthnthn thnthnthn
Chips, picking chips off rocky thumbnail, chips. Horrid!
And gold flushed more
A husky fifenote blew
Blew. Blue bloom is on the
Gold pinnacled hair
A jumping rose on satiny breasts of satin, rose of Castille
Trilling, trilling: I Dolores
Peep! Who's in the... peepofgold?
Tink cried to bronze in pity
And a call, pure, long and throbbing. Longindying call
Decoy. Soft word. But look! The bright stars fade. O rose! Notes chirruping
Answer. Castille. The morn is breaking
Jingle jingle jaunted jingling
Coin rang. Clock clacked
Avowal. Sonnez. I could. Rebound of garter. Not leave thee
Sweetheart, goodbye!
Avowal. Warm

When love absorbs

War! War! The tympanum
A sail! A veil awave upon the waves
Horn. Hawhorn
When first he saw. Alas!
Full tup. Full throb
Warbling. Ah, lure! Alluring
Martha! Come!
Clapclop. Clipclap. Clappyclap
Goodgod henev erheard inall
Deaf bald Pat brought pad knife took up
A moonlight nightcall: far: far
I feel so sad. P. S. So lonely blooming
Listen!
The spiked and winding cold seahorn
Have you the?
Each, and for other, plash and silent roar

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
In the dark, come out and play
We are its child—, here to stay
Running through, hungry for stray'
No invitat—, take me away
I'm not cruel, still what you see
Club to club, city with me
Hungry for life, -out your pity
I don't want, you give it

[Chorus]
Still can't say she won't start up
Still can't say she won't start up a fight
You go the city
'Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait

[Verse 2]
In the dark, killer await'
To kill a life, life you make
You do another, death can live
Just keep on dan—, movie you're in (I'm not cruel)
Smell of your sweat, lures me in
Your heart—, things to me
Running feet, through my blood
My ghost inside you soon will be

[Outro]
Now it's over, you've taken your life
Dark grows thin and left to hide
I don't regret it, but it's sad anyway
Now we're both dead and so scared of the black
This life of games and diligent trust
It's the things we do and the things we must
I'm now tired of being cussed
So go sleep forever end to dustEmbed

Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Alice Glass]
Straight Outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called "Niggas Wit Attitudes"
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep you dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: Alice Glass]
Straight Outta Compton, another crazy-ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm bad, and you know that
But the pussy ass niggas won't show it
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
Legally armed, it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you are at a show
I'ma call you a dirty bitch ass hoe
You'll be in the front row
Call me a dirty bitch ass hoe

I love it when you shake your ass for me
Come on, girl, do your best for me
Oh, girl, give it a rest

I'm still tired when I hear you cryEmbed

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
As we fall into sequence
And we're eating our young
Remain silent and still for modesty
When the splints have been broken
And they can't help you now
Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally?

[Chorus]
Follow me into nowhere
Woven with the utmost care

[Verse 2]
If I'm lost please don't find me
If I drown let me sink
We descended from no one
With a wink
Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally?

[Bridge]
When it's cold outside hold me, don't hold me
Whеn I choose to rest my eyеs coax me, don't coax me
When it's cold outside hold me, don't hold me
When I choose to rest my eyes coax me, don't coax me

[Chorus]
Follow me into nowhere
Woven with the utmost care

Have they cleansed you with chloride?
And scrubbed behind the knees?
Has your body been hollowed by the breeze?
