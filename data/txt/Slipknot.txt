Artist: Slipknot, Alternate Names: Meld
Artist Description: Slipknot is a metal group based in Des Moines, Iowa. They were formed in 1995, and are well known for their live shows and their image of nine masked performers. They are one of the most important bands of the NWOAHM (New Wave of American Heavy Metal).

The band released their demo album Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat on October 31st, 1996. Slipknot went through several lineup changes before settling with their most known line-up: Sid Wilson, Joey Jordison, Paul Gray, Chris Fehn, Jim Root, Craig “133” Jones, Shawn “Clown” Crahan, Mick Thomson, and Corey Taylor.

This core line-up rose to the spotlight after their self-titled debut in 1999 which contained the breakout singles “Wait and Bleed” and “Spit it Out.” They would go on to release Iowa (2001), Vol.3: The Subliminal Verses (2004), All Hope Is Gone (2008), .5: The Gray Chapter (2014), We Are Not Your Kind (2019), and The End, So Far (2022). The band has sold millions of records worldwide.

On May 24th, 2010, bassist and founding member Paul Gray died. Although Slipknot continued to tour, Gray’s death called into the question the possibility of new material. However, in 2013, Slipknot went into the studio to write and record what would be their fifth album. On December 12th of the same year, the band parted ways with drummer and founding member Joey Jordison. It was later revealed in 2016 that Jordison suffered from a rare disease called transverse myelitis (which affected his nerves and left him unable to play the drums).

During the recording process, Slipknot recruited two new members whose identities were, at the time, kept secret. They released .5: The Gray Chapter on October 21st, 2014. After a year of touring, it has been confirmed that Alessandro Venturella and Jay Weinberg were the new bassist and drummer of Slipknot.

On March 14, 2019, Chris Fehn filed a lawsuit against the band citing withheld payments. Fehn specifically accused Corey Taylor and Shawn Crahan of setting up several band-related business entities, in different states, that collect money from the band. Fehn called for full forensic accounting to be done on all of the band’s companies and assets in order to collect any profits and damages he may be owed. On March 17, 2019, the band officially announced, via their website, that Chris Fehn was no longer a member of the band, stating:

Slipknot’s focus is on making album #6, and our upcoming shows around the world, our best ever. Chris knows why he is no longer a part of Slipknot. We are disappointed that he chose to point fingers and manufacture claims, rather than doing what was necessary to continue to be a part of Slipknot. We would have preferred he not take the path that he has, but evolution in all things is a necessary part of this life. Long Live The Knot.

Title: Snuff
Release Date: September 28, 2009, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-snuff-lyrics
Song Description: Snuff is a relatively slow song, as compared to the majority of other songs on the All Hope Is Gone. The acoustic dark song tells the story of a man who falls in love and believes the other person feels the same towards them, just to realize they dont feel that way.

This was the last released single featuring bassist Paul Gray and drummer Joey Jordison. Gray would pass away 8 months after release while Jordison would be fired via email 4 years after release. In later solo shows, Corey Taylor performed an acoustic version of this song as a tribute to Gray.
Lyrics:

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

[Chorus 1]
So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

[Verse 2]
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

[Chorus 2]
So save your breath, I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

Oh, oh

[Chorus 3]
So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know

[Outro]

Title: Psychosocial
Release Date: July 16, 2008, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-psychosocial-lyrics
Song Description: Psychosocial is a song about hate for life and broken society. Its the second single from All Hope is Gone and was nominated for the 2009 Grammy for Best Metal Performance, losing to Metallicas My Apocalypse.

In the video for Psychosocial, Slipknot burned the purgatory masks that they had revealed for during the promotion of the All Hope is Gone album in 2008.

That was a Shawn Crahan idea. Those are Mardi Gras heads of our faces from the death masks we wore in the Vermillion video. Its just a teaser, but its totally genius. When I first heard about it, I was like, Are you fuckin kidding me? But then I saw the results, and I was like, I totally get it! Hes got a good vision, man; hes a great artist.

Joey Jordison

More or less, we have these giant masks that were wearing, called purgatory masks. Theyre like giant death masks, and they represent ego.

Shawn Crahan

[Intro: Corey Taylor]
Ooh, yeah

I did my time, and I want out
So effusive, fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion, pseudo-sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done, it has begun, I'm not the only one

[Chorus: Corey Taylor]
And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess? We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness, venomous, insipid

Title: Duality
Release Date: May 4, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-duality-lyrics
Song Description: Duality was the 1st single from Slipknots 3rd album, Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses, and was released on May 25, 2004. It was produced by Rick Rubin.

It peaked at #5 on the US Rock Chart and reached #15 in the UK, where it remains their highest-charting song. In 2019, Billboard named it the bands best song.

The music video was shot at a fans house, resulting in Roadrunner Records paying the fans family $50,000 for damages incurred in the shoot.



According to Corey Taylor:

Duality is about standing at the crossroads of your life, looking down both paths, and going, Now what am I going to do? Did you ever get that headache that is just not going to go away, and you end up sticking your thumb and middle finger so far into your eyes, just to stop the pain? It usually has to do with making a choice. You get to that point in everyday life when you have to make a decision that you may not want to, but youre kind of pushed into that position. "

Like all of the songs on Vol. 3, Duality contains NO explicit lyrics, and was the first Slipknot single that was released without requiring a clean radio version.

It is also important for the entire album to remember that this is the album where Corey Taylor went sober and Clown dawned his healing mask.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
If the pain goes on

[Verse 1]
I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my time's elapsed
Now all I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create
I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

Title: (sic)
Release Date: June 29, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-sic-lyrics
Song Description: (sic) quickly became a fan favorite, appearing on the greatest hits album Antennas to Hell and the live releases Disasterpieces, 9.0: Live, (sic)nesses, and Live at Dynamo 6.3.2000, which was included on the bonus DVD that came with Slipknot (10th Anniversary Edition). In addition, a remix of the song by Ulrich Wild was released on the Wait and Bleed single and the 10th Anniversary Edition of the album.

In Latin, sic means thus and is shorthand for sic erat scriptum meaning thus it was written.  A backronym is said in context, which essentially means the same thing.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Corey Taylor & Al Pacino]

Title: Unsainted
Release Date: May 16, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-unsainted-lyrics
Song Description: Unsainted is the first single being released from Slipknots album We Are Not Your Kind. The track talks about depression, as vocalist Corey Taylor has suffered from it for many years, but hes finally holding on to letting go.

I do have bouts of severe depression, which are very, very hard to deal with sometimes. [] So Ive really tried to deal with it as naturally as possible, and I know that sounds very hippie-like, but when you know yourself, and you know the habits that you can slip into so easily, you have to find alternatives. []

Corey Taylor, Rolling Stone

The music video for the song shows the bands new masks, succeeding 2014s .5: The Gray Chapter masks. The track was teased on the bands official pages with three videos with captions featuring the songs lyrics but with no sound snippets.



When talking about the album in 2018, Corey Taylor said what completely represents this track:

Its complicated, its dark, its heavy, its heavy, its melodic, its fierce, its angry and its raw as hell. Its going to be talking about a lot of things that people are going to need in their life.

Musically, the song mixes the heaviness of 2001s Iowa in the verses with the melody and commercial side of 2008s All Hope Is Gone in the chorus.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I'll never kill myself to save my soul)
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I didn't come this far to sink so low)
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Verse 1]
I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
Myopic, cannot see straight
Dystopic, one sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting
Go

[Bridge]
Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me
You've killed the saint in me
[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Outro]
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?

Title: Wait and Bleed
Release Date: June 29, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-wait-and-bleed-lyrics
Song Description: Wait and Bleed is about a man who has constant dreams of his suicide by slitting his wrists. One day, he wakes to find that his dream is a reality. He tries to fall back to sleep, but he realizes that this is it. This is final. He has finally done it.

It was nominated for the Grammy for Best Metal Performance in 2001, losing to Deftones' Elite. Slipknot would have three further nominations (Left Behind in 2002, My Plague in 2003 and Vermillion in 2005) before winning the Grammy in 2006 with Before I Forget.

There were two music videos released for the song. The first was directed by Thomas Mignone and is footage of the bands appearance at Ozzfest overdubbed with the studio version of the song.

The second video features clay dolls of the band members outwitting and killing a scientist attempting to capture them.

For the single release, the song was remixed by Terry Date and featured slight tweaks to the instrumentation and vocals. This version and the demo were both included on the 10th Anniversary Edition of the debut album.

Something about this, so very wrong
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this
Is it a dream or a memory?

Title: People = Shit
Release Date: August 28, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-people-shit-lyrics
Song Description: People = Shit is the second track on Slipknots second album Iowa.

We are what we are, we just waste and we ruin and we corrupt, and we destroy, so People=Shit basically because we are our own worst enemy, we are going to be the end of the earth and no one seems to give a shit.
- Shawn Crahan

It follows on from track 1, (515), on which Sid (#0) Wilson shouts People = Shit, played backwards.  While they were recording Iowa, Sids grandfather died and Ross Robinson decided to use Sids grief and anger as part of the recording process.  If you listen carefully you can hear sobs interspersed with the reversed screams.

Title: Nero Forte
Release Date: August 9, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-nero-forte-lyrics
Song Description: Nero Forte, the fifth song on Slipknots sixth studio album We Are Not Your Kind (as well as being the fourth and final single from the album), is more akin to the heavy, fast-paced metal that dominated the bands previous work. Like some of the other songs on the album, the lyrics concern lead singer Corey Taylor and his then-depressive state, casting his depression as an entity that drains him of his being.

The songs title could have a couple of meanings. Nero and Forte are both Italian words that, combined, mean Strong Black in English. However, there was also a famous Roman emperor named Nero, and Forte can mean something that a person excels at. This meaning is verified further by the pre-chorus, in which Corey sings:

Thats what you do best

Thus, the second meaning is more valid, as it implies Coreys depression takes control of him, and, of course, that is what the depression succeeds in doing the most.

When talking about the song, guitarist Jim Root stated:

This is also a Clown song, which is amazing. This one is going to be great live. Its very percussive, and reminiscent of Psychosocialbut maybe an evolution of Psychosocial. Obviously, Clown is a drummer and percussionist, but hes also a songwriterand he always has been. Now were able to collaborate as songwriters, and this is what we end up with. When Corey came in and started diving into the vocals, he came up with this extra melody in the chorus line, very late into the process. That really drew me into this song.

A music video for the song was released in December 2019.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Watch this

[Verse 1]
I'm never enough
You bleed me dry, using me up
Dissatisfied and used
Another key to the empty spot in you
I'm sick as a fuck
I'm in my prime, what do you want?
I guess it's time to see
If you're lost in hell, you'll find no peace
Ooh, wade through hate and fear
I haven't felt like this in years
Not much left, so uprooted
Fists clenched tight in the pockets of my hoodie
And I know where I need to go
But the voice of reason can't say no
It's in the eyes and heart
Just the latest psycho off the charts

[Pre-Chorus]
That's what you do best

[Chorus]
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now

Release Date: June 29, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-eyeless-lyrics
Song Description: A song from Slipknots debut album. At 0:02 Eyeless samples Ease Yourself by The Collective, which in turn heavily samples Amen Brother by The Winstons (at 1:27). The Amen Brother sample on its own is used again in Pulse of The Maggots (at 1:52). Live versions of the song were featured on Disasterpieces, 9.0: Live, Voliminal: Inside the Nine, (sic)nesses, and Live at Dynamo 6.3.2000.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Insane, am I the only motherfucker with a brain?
I'm hearing voices, but all they do is complain
How many times have you wanted to kill
Everything and everyone? Say you'll do it but never will

[Chorus]
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

[Verse 2]
I am my father's son
'Cause he's a phantom, a mystery, and that leaves me nothing
How many times have you wanted to die?
It's too late for me, all you have to do is get rid of me

[Chorus]
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

Maybe I'll reverse my ride
Who the fuck are you? Fuck you
Better suck it up 'cause you bled through
Better get away from me
Stay the fuck away from me

Title: Spit It Out
Release Date: June 29, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-spit-it-out-lyrics
Song Description: Spit it Out was the first song that Slipknot wrote with Corey Taylor. It is one of the bands best known songs due to their live interaction with the crowd (this has been dubbed The Crazy Test and Jump The Fuck Up) . It also features Taylor rapping unlike the majority of Slipknots other tracks. In addition to being included on Antennas from Hell and 9.0: Live, it has also appeared on every video release by the band.

There are a number of alternate studio versions as well. The 10th Anniversary Edition of the debut included two remixes (the Hyper Version and the Stamp You Out Mix) and a live version recorded at Dynamo Festival 2000. The pre-album demo also included a rougher version of the song.

According to Joel McIvers book Slipknot Unmasked:

it was allegedly written in response to the growing rivalry between two Central Iowan radio stations (KAZR and KKDM).  Slipknot were now Des Moines' leading band, and because they were allied to (KKDM), KAZR allegedly resented this, attempting to pit (them) against (local band 35' Mudder).

In the aftermath, amongst other incidents,  Slipknot were removed from a concert in Chicago supporting Anthrax.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Since you never gave a damn in the first place
Maybe it's time you had the tables turned
'Cause in the interest of all involved, I got the problem solved
And the verdict is guilty

[Verse 1]
Man, nearly killed me, steppin' where you fear to tread
Stop, drop and roll, you were dead from the get-go
Big mouth fucker, stupid cocksucker
Are you scared of me now? Then you're dumber than I thought
Always is and never was
Foundation made of piss and vinegar
Step to me, I'll smear ya, think I fear ya? Bullshit
Just another dumb punk chompin' at this tit
Is there any way to break through the noise?
Was it something that I said that got you bent?
It's gotta be that way if you want it
Sanity, literal profanity, hit me

[Chorus]

All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out

Maybe it's the way you gotta spread a lot of rumor, fodder
Keepin' all your little spies and leavin' when you realize
Step up, fairy
I guess it's time to bury your ass with the chrome
Straight to the dome
You heard me right, bitch, I didn't stutter
And if you know what's good just shut up and beg, brother
Backstab, don't you know who you're dissin'?
Sideswipe, we know the ass that you're kissin'

[Verse 3]
Bigity-biggidy bitch-boy, halfway hauser
Don't hear shit 'cause it keeps gettin' louder
Come up and you get a face full of tactic
Lippin' off hard, goin' home in a basket
You got no pull, no power, no nothin'
Now you start shit? Well, ain't that somethin'?
Payoffs don't protect, and you can hide if you want
But I'll find you, comin' up behind you

[Chorus]
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out

'Bout time I set this record straight
All the needle-nose punchin' is makin' me irate
Sick of my bitchin' fallin' on deaf ears
Where you gonna be in the next five years?
The crew and all the fools and all the politics
Get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick
You got dick when they passed out the good stuff
Bam, are you sick of me? Good enough, had enough

As with all the songs on Vol. 3 it is profanity-free.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Go

[Verse 1]
Stapled shut, inside an outside world, and I'm
Sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home
I'm claustrophobic, closing in
And I'm catastrophic, not again
I'm smeared across the page and doused in gasoline
I wear you like a stain, yet I'm the one who's obscene
Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections
I've got no time to lose, I'm just caught up in all the cattle

[Pre-Chorus]
Fray the strings
Throw the shapes
Hold your breath
Listen

[Chorus]
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget

I'm ripped across the ditch
And settled in the dirt and I
Wear you like a stitch
Yet I'm the one who's hurt
Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions
I've got no right to win
I'm just caught up in all the battles

[Pre-Chorus]
Locked in clutch
Pushed in place
Hold your breath
Listen

[Chorus]
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that

[Bridge]
My end, it justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
The end of the road
And my end, it justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
The end of the road
[Chorus]
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that
I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand

Title: Vermilion, Pt. 2
Release Date: October 16, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-vermilion-pt-2-lyrics
Song Description: The narrative of the two Vermilion songs is ostensibly about a killer and his victim, but the subtext suggests that the victim is merely a personification of an ideal quality that the narrator does not or cannot ever possess. She could also embody addiction; a craving that can never be sated, or ignorance that can never be edified.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
She seemed dressed in all of me
Stretched across my shame
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd do anything to have her to myself
Just to have her for myself
Now I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

[Verse 2]
She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
A song that no one sings
The unattainable

[Pre-Chorus]
She's a myth that I have to believe in
All I need to make it real is one more reason
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

Torn into pieces
I won't, no

But I won't let this build up inside of me

I won't let this build up inside of me

Title: Custer
Release Date: October 15, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-custer-lyrics
Song Description: Custer is the eleventh track on Slipknots .5: The Gray Chapter.

In an interview for Kerrang! Magazine, frontman Corey Taylor spoke about this song:

Again, this is focusing that anger towards the outside world  the people who on one hand want to make us martyrs, but at the same time want to make us bastards. And metaphorically its about charging into our last stand, and its basically saying, You know what? Just when you think youve written our history, were going to rewrite it again, and basically show you that we can take all the abuse that you put out there, and were not going to lose a step, were not going to lose an inch, were not going to lose any ground  were going to keep coming.

The song title is a possible homage to notorious and controversial Civil War figure George Armstrong Custer..



Custers' notoriety originated following the infamous 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn. The titular figure rejected assistance in the form of gatling guns and another battalion, instead choosing to undertake the conflict against the Cheyenne himself, resulting in the complete annihilation of his 700 man force, known as the Custer Battalion.

The scale and nature of the defeat led to the battle to be considered Custers Last Stand, as the glaring loss of troop and territory overshadowed his past militaristic achievements with the United States Army.

Half-alive and stark-raving free and maligned
For encroaching on the purpose of this commercial-free interruption
Due to the prolific nature of this statement
Listener aggression is advised

[Verse 1]
It's strange, whenever I see a gun
I think about just how petty you are
And it blows my fucking mind
Yeah, it blows my fucking mind
These days, I never seem to get enough
I'm tired of this shit, I wanna go home
Don't waste my fucking time
Don't waste my fucking time
Because anything exceptional
Gets crushed by common people
With jealousy and ignorance
And all their common evils
This planet isn't special
Collections made of clay
I'm waiting for the punishment

And I finally saw the truth
Something so profound, and it was sitting there
Surrounded by the garbage and the stains
Another victim of the refuse
Now I've been saying this for years
But you don't comprehend it

Title: Solway Firth
Release Date: July 22, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-solway-firth-lyrics
Song Description: Solway Firth is the second single from Slipknots sixth album, We Are Not Your Kind. The title is likely a reference to the Solway Firth Spaceman which is an image of a little girl and a spaceman standing in the background. The photographer swears that the spaceman wasnt there before.



Hence the song talks about fabrication or false portrayal, or maybe literally just the idea of something being there when in truth its not.

Solway Firth is also a place in the United Kingdom; to be precise, it is a firth that forms part of the border between England and Scotland.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Today, up on this hill, I'm counting all the killers
They sway as they swarm, a look of gluttons in their eyes
They mutter as the body loses warmth
They pick your bones like locks inside a tomb
And take great care to not take care of you
Here’s an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one

[Verse 1]
While I was learning to live, we all were living a lie
I guess you got what you wanted
So I will settle for a slaughterhouse soaked in blood and betrayal
It's always somebody else, somebody else was me
You want the real smile?
Or the one I used to practice not to feel like a failure?

[Chorus]
I don’t need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me

If I’m alive tomorrow
I will alleviate the pressure by cutting you out of me
I found my bottom line dead on the front lines
I know I'll never go home
So set fire to your ships and past regrets and be free

[Chorus]
I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don’t need you to hide it from me

Title: All Out Life
Release Date: October 31, 2018, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-all-out-life-lyrics
Song Description: All Out Life is a song bashing the music industry. Its a single which was not included in Slipknots Iowa levels of heavy sixth studio album called We Are Not Your Kind, something that everyone expected. On the track, the band criticizes the recent trend of thinking that any old music is depreciable, without considering its importance in forming out the music of the moment. As Corey Taylor said to Metal Sucks:

Its like, I love new music, but at the same time, dont turn your back on the music thats been.

Regarding instrumentality, the song has an electronic intro, followed by a heavy guitar riff and, finally joined Coreys gutturals. The sound is completely different from their 2014 album, .5: The Gray Chapter; instead, the sonority reminisces old albums such as Iowa and Slipknot.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
What a world, the horizon's
Coming like a hell-bent killing machine
Can't afford to be the goddamn wreckage
Burn it all again at a million degrees
Calling all the adamant upper-level
Undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear
Throw away all the meaningless shit that's clinging
The enemy is here, I said stop

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
One by one against, give me the name
All you shiny pretty never-wills ruined the game
You hold all the keys, so the chains shouldn't hold you
I know you heard me, I fucking told you

[Chorus]
Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses, I challenge you to all out fucking life

[Verse 2]
Drop that shit and put it on a pedestal
Children are afraid of the gods
Raise your hands and show me what's impossible
That makes us even, never tell me the odds
What a bore, I'm getting stuck in a metaphor
I don't wanna go to sleep

Title: Killpop
Release Date: October 15, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-killpop-lyrics
Song Description: Killpop has a similar concept to Vermilion in which the narrator is obsessed with someone (or something) of beauty, but finds it impossible to coexist with it.

The meaning behind the lyrics was revealed by Corey in a radio interview:

The song is my reflection on my relationship with music. Thats who the she is. And not just music, but the music industry in general. So theres a love-hate relationship there that really kind of comes into view.

The music video includes lots of Yin-Yang imagery, with two women painted white and black. It brings to mind how Slipknot and pop music are both kinds of music, existing in the same industry, but are so vastly different from one another, and also need each other to maintain meaning.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
She's sticking needles in her skin, I turn with an ugly grin
Her canvas doesn't leave a lot to fantasy
But her peace of mind can't stay inside the lines
It's so confusing, the methods that she's using
She knows she shouldn't leave a mark that I can see
Will she ever find one million of a kind?
It's cold and lonely, but that's because she told me
Lost inside her dirty world, no one hurts this pretty girl but her

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, she's beautiful
A little better than a man deserves
Oh, I'm not insane
Please tell me she won't change

[Chorus]
Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (She loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (She loves me), oh

[Verse 2]
She's drowning in herself again, my God, what a lovely sin
I guess there's nothing left to do but have my way
She can feel it's right, so she doesn't close her eyes
She smiles and answers, it doesn't seem to matter
Lost inside my dirty head, something tells me I'm the one who's kept

Song Description: Part 1 in a narrative about a predator and its prey, Vermilion imagines the neurotic obsession of a killer over his victim. But this victim is special; different, somehow
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
She seems dressed in all the rings of past fatalities
So fragile, yet so devious, she continues to see
Climatic hands that press her temples and my chest
Enter the night that she came home, forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, she's the only one that makes me sad

[Verse 2]
She is everything and more, the solemn hypnotic
My dahlia bathed in possession, huh, she is home to me
I get nervous, perverse, when I see her, it's worse
But the stress is astounding
It's now or never, she's comin' home, forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, she's the only one that makes me sad
(What am I doing here?)
(She's my imagination come alive)
(What am I doing? What am I doing here?)
(She's my imagination come alive)
(My imagination come alive, come alive)
Hard to say what caught my attention
Fixed and crazy, aphid attraction
Carve my name in my face (Carve my name) to recognize
Such a pheromone cult (Terrorize) to terrorize

Lyrics:

[Intro: Corey Taylor]
Hold on to something

[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
Yeah, I wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound
I wanna push my face in and feel the swoon
Wanna dig inside, find a little bit of me
'Cause the line gets crossed when you don't come clean
My wormwood meets your pesticide
You'll never get out 'cause you were never alive
I am infinite, I am the infant finite
Come a little closer, and I'll show you why

[Chorus: Corey Taylor, Clown & Chris Fehn]
No one is safe
Noises, noises, people make noises
People make noises when they're sick
Nothing to do except hold on to nothing
No one is safe
Noises, noises, people make noises
People make noises when they're sick
Nothing to do except hold on to nothing

[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
Oh, how does it feel to be locked inside another dream
That never had a chance of being realized?
What the fuck are you lookin' at?
I'll tell you what you're lookin' at
Everyone you ever fucking laughed at
Oh, look in my eyes for the answers, typical
I can feel it underneath like a miracle
Everybody in the world needs more than
Lies and consequences to power them
Once again, it's me and no one else
I can't remember if there was a someone else
It's not mine, it's not fair, it's outta my hands
And it's shaking, you'll never take me

Pull your hands away, I'm gone, goodbye, it's so depressing
Withering away, take a look inside, my soul is missing
All I have is dead, so I'll take you with me
I feel like I'm erased, so kill me just in case
I feel like I'm erased, so kill me just in case
So kill me just in case

Release Date: August 28, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-the-heretic-anthem-lyrics
Song Description: Originally called The Heretic Song, this song was the first promo single released from Iowa.  An anti-single, the song was retitled  Anthem when Iowa was released.

Corey Taylor, the first time introducing the song:

A couple of months ago, some evil people, some money hungry, cocksucking, idiot motherfuckers came to us and said: You know, if you want your next album to be huge, you gotta write a radio friendly song  Now being that we are Slipknot, we are 9 crazy people from the middle of nowhere, 9 people that do not give one rat fuck about what the fucking music industry fucking thinks, we stood there politely, we processed the information and we said: Well, thank you Mr. Businessman, but if youll excuse me SUCK MY MOTHERFUCKIN' DICK!!! And this next song is a result of that fuckin' conversation, if youre 555 then I am 666, this song is called Heretic Song!
Lyrics:

[Intro]
(Eight-seven-six-six-six
Five-four-three-two-one-zero)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm a pop star threat, and I'm not dead yet
Got a super-dred bet with an angel drughead
Like a deadbeat winner, I wanna be a sinner
An idolized bang for the industry killer
A hideous man that you don't understand
Throw a suicide party, and I'm guaranteed to fucking snap
It's evilsonic, it's pornoholic
Breakdowns, obscenities, it's all I wanna be

[Chorus: Corey Taylor, Clown & Chris Fehn]
If you're five-five-five, then I'm six-six-six
If you're five-five-five, I'm six-six-six
But if you're five-five-five, I'm six-six-six
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're five-five-five, I'm six-six-six
What's it like to be a heretic?

[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
Everybody's so infatuated
Everybody's so completely sure of what we are
Everybody defamates from miles away
But face to face, they haven't got a thing to say
I bleed for this, and I bleed for you
Still, you look in my face like I'm somebody new
Toy, nobody wants anything I've got
Which is fine because you're made of everything I'm not

Tell me again how you're tortured
I wanna know how you followed your orders so well
You're full of shit, you had a dream, but this ain't it

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Fuck!

[Verse 1]
Fire and caffeine, a lot of nicotine
I'm gonna burn, so I better tell you everything
The competition, the superstition
Nevermind 'cause you're never going to give in
It's a crisis, just how you like it
The same drama in a different disguise
I'm bound to walk with a target on my back
At least I'm ready for another attack

[Chorus]
The lord of lies, the morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides, your choices are
The negative one and me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Svengali, why are we the enemies?
I never follow, and I never make apologies
Your dementias are gonna get you
Because your walls can't support each other
Settle for the cynical, you're so political
You're getting ready 'cause the first move is critical
Reciprocity, somebody's listening
What did we learn from our time in captivity?

(They all will fall)
The cystic, symbolic, condition
(Systemic)
Egregious, replete with these lesions
(Contaminate)
Succumb to the selfish creation

[Verse 3]
No accountability, divisibility
I point a finger, but it's always looking back at me
The centipede's pulling on the mechanism
Unearthing scars of the cataclysm
When the innocent begin to circumvent
The color fades, but the picture is vibrant
What do you believe? Does it matter now?
Turn away, the killer is disavowed
[Chorus]
The lord of lies, the morning star
You had to be set free

Release Date: August 28, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-iowa-lyrics
Song Description: Longest song made by the band. In a Q&A with Corey Taylor, he describes the song about being alone with a corpse. Recording the song was a trip for Corey since he recorded his vocals while stripped naked, vomiting, and cutting himself with glass.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJm-WFRLQi4

Slipknot Wiki
There is a secret message in the song. After the verses finish and the guitars fade out, Corey can be heard screaming multiple things. One of the things he is screaming is something that sounds like Gah makin' noises repeatedly. This is actually a sample of Corey screaming played by Craig Jones. When the song is played backwards, it is actually dont look at me.

Title: Dead Memories
Release Date: December 1, 2008, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-dead-memories-lyrics
Song Description: Dead Memories was the third single released from All Hope Is Gone.

Without naming names, its the story of my last 10 years. Ive been holding onto these things for the last 10 years, Ive decided its just time to let them go.

Corey Taylor

The music video, directed by P.R. Brown and Shawn Crahan, depicts Taylor walking through different underground/grave rooms, each inhabited by a different member of the band.  These interactions could allude to some of the memories that Corey Taylor has decided to bury and let go of.

A 10 minute version of the music video, narrated by Taylor exists:

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Sitting in the dark, I can't forget
Even now, I realize the time I'll never get
Another story of the bitter pills of fate
I can't go back again, I can't go back again
But you asked me to love you and I did
Traded my emotions for a contract to commit
And when I got away, I only got so far
The other me is dead
I hear his voice inside my head

[Pre-Chorus]
We were never alive
And we won't be born again
But I'll never survive

[Chorus]
With dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart

[Verse 2]
You told me to love you and I did
Tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit
So when I got away, I only kept my scars
The other me is gone
Now I don't know where I belong

Let him crave understanding
Let him crave your wisdom
Let him crave
Let him be provoked
Father, by self-control

[Verse 1]
I'm just a Judas, lookin' for a silver line
And tomorrow is still a step behind
Hey, hey, drama, I'd love to be a waste of your time
Oh no, thanks so much for wasting mine
So hear me out
Let's hear it for the damaged
Who understands but the broken?
Developed in the arms of spite
I'm all fucked up and I make it look good

I'm over your throne
I'm over it

We are the bitter, the maladjusted and wise
Fighting off a generation too uptight
We're all dressed up with nobody to kill

Title: Purity
Release Date: June 29, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-purity-lyrics
Song Description: The song was written about a story that Corey Taylor read on a website. According to the story, a girl named Adrianne Purity Knight was kidnapped and buried alive. Corey thought that the story was true, but the author claimed that Adrianne was fictional, and objected to the use of the story in the song. This led to a lawsuit, which resulted in Purity being removed from Slipknots debut album. However, the lawsuit was settled, and Purity appeared on the 10-year anniversary re-release of the album. Live versions of the song appear on Disasterpieces and 9.0: Live.

I still think its real. See the thing whether its true or not, its a real story, that we read about, that fucked our whole world up. Can you imagine a girl being buried in a box and having all this lecherous bullshit drip down on her from this guy? And thinking that there is hope, because this kid is taking some bizarre note to this guy he doesnt even know- thinking that you are holding on to the shirt of hope and you wake up, and youre dead youre buried in mud -they find the note about a week later shoved in a library book for gods sakes -it just hurts your head- its a case of what is good and bad in people- the box alone is reason enough to be like,I cant stand to be fucking human- how can someone fucking do this to somebody? What is inside of us that is so fucking wrong? He had written quotes from Edgar Allen Poe and lots of fucked up things on the box
- Corey Taylor

Lyrics:

[Intro]
No!

[Verse 1]
Maze, psychopathic daze, I create this waste
Back away from tangents, on the verge of drastic
Ways, can't escape this place, I deny your face
Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying

[Pre-Chorus]
Put me in a homemade cellar
Put me in a hole for shelter
Someone, hear me please, all I see is hate
I can hardly breathe and I can hardly take it
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't

[Verse 2]
Lost, ran at my own cost, hearing laughter, scoffed
Learning from the rush, detached from such and such
Bleak all around me, weak, listening incomplete
I am not a dog, but I'm the one you're dogging

[Pre-Chorus]
I am in a buried kennel
I have never felt so final
Someone, find me please, losing all reserve
I'm fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't

Title: A Liar’s Funeral
Release Date: August 9, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-a-liars-funeral-lyrics
Song Description: Musically, this song progresses in a slow but painfully heavy atmosphere, almost resembling 2008s Snuff. The song gives the listener the opportunity to go with Corey Taylor in yet another trip to his depression story, reflecting on how society looks at depressed people.

In this song, Corey seems to point his finger at the friends who looked down on him for his depression, calling them liars and advising the listener to never trust that type of people. This leaves him hopeless and it makes him feel like the only way to make them happy is dying. By doing that, hes playing his partthat is to say, giving them what they really wanted.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
A season at an end
A harvest of seclusion and regret
The burning can begin
A period of ash is what you get
The quiet is a curse
But my respect was shown to you by force
Another day too late
Another neck too eager for the rope

[Refrain]
Liar
Liar

[Verse 2]
Yesterday was hard
Tomorrow's just a promise of the same
When friends have all subscribed
To spitting on the ground to say my name
Fire on the ice
December in the summer kills the heart
Your hate is no surprise
I guess I have to die to play my part

[Refrain]

You close your eyes and join the blind
Slit your wrists for peace of mind
Turn your back and show us the truth
There's only one way to remember it for you
Burn, burn, burn the liar (Liar)
Burn, burn, burn the liar (Liar)
Burn, burn, burn the liar (Liar)
Burn, burn, burn the liar

[Chorus]
(Hold the weight)
Never trust the one beside you
(Carried away)
You know just as much as I do

Title: Scissors
Release Date: June 29, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-scissors-lyrics
Song Description: The final song on Slipknots self-titled debut (excluding secret track Eeyore and bonus tracks).

The lyrics were written by Joey Jordison about self-harm, but the last lines were improvised by Corey Taylor (and thought to be about drug addiction).

The secret track after silence is the band watching a scat-porn film, with the coughing = Chris Fehn throwing up in disgust.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I play doctor for five minutes flat
Before I cut my heart open and let the air out
Three bugs, a pound of dust
Some wind spilled before me
In the strangest manner that had
Broke away my tear spout

[Verse 1]
As I lie there with my tongue spread wide open
A black widow had offered me a sweetheart tube
As I injected the candied heart that I selected
She said, "Don't hesitate, just do what you have to do to me"

[Verse 2]
It's hard to stay between the lines of skin
Just 'cause I have nerves don't mean that I can feel
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
Just let the blood run red 'cause I can't feel
It's hard to stay between the lines of skin
Just 'cause I have nerves don't mean that I can feel
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
Just let the blood run red 'cause I can't feel

[Bridge]
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time, it's time
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time, it's time
Biding my time until the time is right

I want to see you splayed before me
You are the only one
That I would rather see before me

Title: Orphan
Release Date: August 9, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-orphan-lyrics
Song Description: In this song, Corey Taylor talks about his traumatic past and the harshness of life at a very young age. He tells his story, takes stock, and exorcises his ultimate frustration and anger. The tracks themes and sound are similar to the bands 2001 album Iowa.

Taylors lyrics include topics of canniblism and murder that can be seen as a fierce metaphor for feeling lost, questioning life, and reacting to ones misfortunes when feeling down. Even if hes doing better now, you can hear in some lyrics that the past is not completely dead and traumas will never fade.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I wept when I realized
There were no more demons left to conquer
An opportunity to show my feelings
With skin so thick you swear it was armor
A penitentiary that only lets the oxygen out
I wasn't ready for a version of the truth to get out
I’m getting desperate, I wouldn't wanna fester in another bad dream

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I am a man of extremes, I found the flesh and I'm liking it
I’ll put an end to all the fucking psychobabble
We eat the meat 'cause the meat had a soul
We take the lives 'cause to hurt makes us whole

[Chorus]
I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story? Take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan
The one who killed your world

Keeping up appearances with acts of attrition
It doesn't matter 'cause I know you'll never listen, before
You knew it when you saw it, now you say you never knew it
It was all a big conspiracy
We came together when the hands of fate let go
Is there anybody left to fill this hole?
This shit will never wash off
Give yourself a medal, I swear, I fucking give up
We're nothing special, just an accidental tweak of the freak
An evolution of the kennel in the fetish you seek
There's still a part of me that’s dying in a dumpster
The one who rose is a motherfucking monster

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I’ve seen the future and it's simply burning
I wasn’t put here to be so discerning
You want the world to be dissatisfied
You don't care, so why the fuck should I?
Fuck, should I sell myself to stay alive?

[Chorus]
I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story? Take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan
The one who kills
The one who killed your world
[Bridge]
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything

[Verse 3]
Tell me all about it, I love to hear it
The way I ruin everything I touch
I never thought I'd get to say I'm sorry
But then again I think you ask too much
Too white to be black, too black to be blue
Too sick to be me, too fucked to be you
I only wonder if I’ll live to see the end of the road
It always gets me nowhere

[Chorus]
I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story? Take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan
The one who killed your world

Title: Sulfur
Release Date: August 20, 2008, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-sulfur-lyrics
Song Description: Sulfur is All Hope Is Gones fourth single, it deals with depression and sadness. According to Joey Jordison, this was written in one evening.

This is the first song Jim [Root, guitarist] and I ever wrote together. I took my electronic drums to his house and set them up in the kitchen. He wrote all the riffs, then we put them together. It was really special to write a song with him at last.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
My guilt and my shame
Always sell me short, always feel the same
And my face and my soul
Always wear me thin, always under control
But the longest hours you'll have in your life
Are the ones you sit through to know if you're right
So I'll wait, but I'll pray that I'm wrong
Because I think I know what's going on

[Verse 2]
So let me get this straight
The only will is my own
I do whatever I want and stay alone
All my decisions make it, untouchable and tainted
I'm gonna suffer for the rest of my life
But I will always find a way to survive
I'm not a failure, but I know what it's like
I can take it or leave it or die

[Chorus]
Stay, you don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like breathing in sulfur

My life is undone
And I'm a sinner to most but a sage to some
And my gods are untrue
I'm probably wrong but I'm better than you
And the longest hours I've had in my life
Were the ones I went through to know I was right
So I'm safe but I'm a little outside
I'm gonna laugh when I'm buried alive

[Chorus]
Stay, you don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like breathing in sulfur

Title: Critical Darling
Release Date: August 9, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-critical-darling-lyrics
Song Description: Critical Darling is the 6th track on Slipknots album We Are Not Your Kind.
As pointed out by sasha fergsn in a Russian translation of the song, critical darling is a set phrase denoting the object of sympathy and flattering (at times unjustifiably) reviews by critics in the art, film, music and other industries. There is a play on meaning with the phrase Darling, youre so critical.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
God's in a coma
Put faith in a life support
Running away won’t feel the same
If you reach your metaphysical last resort
Oh, malevolence and purgatory give you pause
It's a miracle you haven't broken any laws
We are not entitled to surviving
So keep your friends and your enemies thriving

[Refrain]
(Good for you) What a cliché
(Just not true) What a giveaway
(What comes now) Can’t be the last one
Falling down

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time this happens
I'm breaking a promise
I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet
And keep it away
From the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

[Verse 2]
Once again, we got suffocated
In a sick perversion of a spider’s web
Crawling over all the spent digested pieces
Celebrate the dead
Here come all the judging eyes
Gotta pave the road with your best intentions
I only wish you could picture a future
That doesn’t resemble your crazy inventions

[Refrain]
(Good on you) I don't mean it
(Dream come true) I don’t need it
(What goes up) Another hollow one
Must come down

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time this happens
I'm breaking a promise
I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet
And keep it away
From the leeches who want to deceive?
[Chorus]
What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it’s too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

[Bridge]
A mirror only works if you open your eyes
But even then you have to understand what's inside
The easy part is always hardest to see
I know you'll never guess, but darling, you're so critical
Darling, you're so critical
Oh, you're so critical

[Verse 3]
Oh, this is a cave-in
The weight of the catalyst
Just wait, let the games begin
Gonna tell you all about it for the savages

[Refrain]
(Good for you) Not another one
(Just not true) Not another one
(What comes now?) This world is
Falling down
[Pre-Chorus]
Every time this happens
I'm breaking a promise
I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet
And keep it away
From the leeches who want to deceive?

[Chorus]
What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

Lyrics:

I'm in conniptions for the final act you came here for
The one derivative you manage is the one I abhor
I need a minute to elaborate for everyone the everyday
Bullshit things that you have done
Your impossible ego-fuck
Is like a megalomaniacal tab on my tongue
You fuckin' touch me, I will rip you apart
I'll reach in and take a bite out of that shit you call a heart

[Interlude]
Yeah

Title: The Chapeltown Rag
Release Date: November 5, 2021, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-the-chapeltown-rag-lyrics
Song Description: The Chapeltown Rag is Slipknots first first single since their 2019 album We Are Not Your Kind. Before release, the track was teased with 9 NFTs on a website called Chapeltown Rag. Each NFT came with a small snippet of the new song.

The songs lyrics center on the British serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, also known as the Yorkshire Ripper. From 1975 to 1980, Sutcliffe attacked and murdered at least 13 women in the Chapeltown area of Leeds, England. The song also ties in with current issues, as explained by vocalist Corey Taylor:

Its a punisher, man. Its classic Slipknot. And its frenetic. But lyrically, its coming from a point of talking about the various manipulations that can happen when social media meets media itself. And the different ways that these manipulations can try to pull us in different directions, in the fact that were all becoming addicts to it, which is very, very dangerous.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Read all about it if you want to know
Read all about what they want you to know

[Verse 1]
Everything is god online, and it's as evil as it gets
This is not a fuckin' trick, either follow or repent (No choice)
Get infected by a vertical event
Check the meter, check your watch
Are they ever gonna stop?
Runnin' out of daylight, nighttime's better
But we know how to handle the truth, motherfucker
Scandalous know-it-all, feedback chamber
Nobody wants the proof, they want a number

We don't deny what is wrong with our lives
We can't decide what is left of our right to silence our remains
Buried in the back and I'm sick and alive
Hollow as a breath, the further you dive

You never miss with your intensity

All your fucking monsters are flaws in your common sense
Do the dance while the shovels are breaking dirt
Everybody mind your fuckin' business or you get hurt

We don't deny what is wrong with our lives
We can't decide what is left of our right to silence our remains

Stoned like a beast on a chain lookin' dead
Feelin' strange, what the fuck
I'm material to sew into the stains
Like a catalogue of pain, like a martyr in restraints
I can kill with a will, and it's stronger every day
I'm a knife, I'm a gun, I'm a slit, I'm a scar
I'm a scream, I'm a death, I'm a threat, I'm afraid
That you will never understand I'm not the same
You better call the triple 9, I want a face
That you can only recognize
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid

Title: AOV
Release Date: October 15, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-aov-lyrics
Song Description: AOV (An abbreviation for Approaching Original Violence) is the third track on Slipknots .5: The Gray Chapter.

In an interview for Kerrang! Magazine, Corey Taylor spoke about this song:

AOV stands for Approaching Original Violence. The album as a whole is the story of the last four years for this band, so AOV is basically about looking at each other and dealing with a lot of the issues that weve had, to try to bury those hatchets, so we can get back up on our feet. Because you cant stand together until you figure out what the issue is. You have to get on the same page to be able to move forward  its just really about finding a way to stand on that common ground and not only stand on it, but take that territory back and guard it as your own.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Black, dirty teeth in the crease
Was the proof too good to be believed?
It's the cunt with the tongue
Who belongs on broken knees
So far, it occurs to me
That everybody in the world is afraid of me
Just one more sin and down we go
But the news is out, and I think I'm going to
Kill myself or fuck myself or tell myself
About the only thing that matters now

[Pre-Chorus]
We bury what we fear the most
Approaching original violence
Is the silence where you hide it?
'Cause I don't recognize you anymore

You covered up, did you cultivate?
Be yourself, not yourself, know yourself
'Cause no one seems to know you now

[Pre-Chorus]
We carry what we can't control
Approaching original violence
In the silence, there's a nihilist...
Who doesn't care and never did

[Chorus]
To each his own...
Life can do with one less watered-down excuse
There comes a time where we can’t take the same abuse
If this is over, you can tell me it's no use, use

[Verse 3]
Drug out, pissed on, everything's the same
Bitch and moan, it doesn't matter, nothing's gonna change
I don't wanna watch another brother fucking die
So discarded, fallen by the side
Don't tell me it's the only way
Just another reason why you never take the bait
The trials, the scheming, the burden of the beast
Both your faces turn your back on everything
You fought to save a dream
[Bridge]
Ooh!
Now that it's over...
When this is over...
Yeah!

[Pre-Chorus]
We are the angels' fear to tread
Approaching original violence
We're the silence, we'll deny it
We can't continue on like this

[Chorus]
To each his own...
Life can do with one less watered-down excuse
There comes a time where we can't take the same abuse
My God, it would've taken just one word to stay from you
Now that this is over, you can tell me it's no use
Now that this is over, you can tell me it's no use, use
Just tell me it's over

[Outro]
It doesn't matter what you say
It doesn't matter what you do
We can't continue on like this21Embed

Title: XIX
Release Date: October 15, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-xix-lyrics
Song Description: XIX is the opening track from Slipknots 5th album, .5: The Gray Chapter. This is the first album released by the band following the death of bassist, Paul Gray in 2010 and the departure of drummer, Joey Jordison in 2013. This song features a droning bagpipe to match the atmosphere of a funeral march.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Shawn Crahan]
This song is not for the living
This song is for the dead

[Verse: Corey Taylor]
With my face against the floor
I can't see who knocked me out of the way
I don't want to get back up
But I have to, so it might as well be today
Nothing appeals to me, no one feels like me
I'm too busy being calm to disappear
I'm in no shape to be alone
Contrary to the shit that you might hear

[Chorus: Corey Taylor]
So walk with me, walk with me
Don't let this symbolism kill your heart
Walk with me, walk with me
Just like we should've done right from the start
Walk with me, walk with me
Don't let this fucking world tear you apartSee Slipknot LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also like26Embed

Title: Not Long for This World
Release Date: August 9, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-not-long-for-this-world-lyrics
Song Description: Not Long for This World mainly talks about Corey Taylor hurting himself and feeling like his life is not going to last much. While he recognizes all is just a difficult stage, he pleads for a certain someone to let him die, feeling that he has lived what he could and saying hes already through with life, stating that living never felt so bad.

Corey also seems to criticize people that dont accept or look down on people that live with depression, but also does not care about that type of people, something he reinforces not only in this song but also on Solway Firth when he sings:

I dont need you to do it for me
I dont need you to understand
I dont need you to hide it from me
I just want to feel like any other man
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Cutting or scratching, they scar the same
The angle is off, edges are soft, the mark remains
I know I'm bitter and full of rage
You would be too, what I've been through
Knowledge is a difficult age

[Chorus]
So decide, tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide, tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see
Not long for this world

[Verse 2]
Carving or biting, we bleed for keeps
Out of control, into the cold, hell repeats
God, I'm starving, spreading me thin
Buying a story, my soul was for sale, trust is such an arrogant thing

[Chorus]
So decide, tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide, tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see

I know the shit you eat
There's nothing mellow in the drama you live and breathe
You like your secrets to be kept in the family
You don't get credit for your rare good behavior
Go be a savior
You don't seem to get what I'm saying
And I'm sick and tired of explaining
Good night, goodbye, good luck
There's nothing worse than a ghoul manifesto
I'm not impressed though

[Pre-Chorus]
The greatest conclusion that I ever had
Was when I woke up and said that's enough
Living never felt so bad
You don't accept it and I don't care
Bury yourself above all your guilt
When you're ready, it'll be there

[Chorus]
So decide, tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide, tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see

Title: Red Flag
Release Date: August 9, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-red-flag-lyrics
Song Description: After the boundary-stretching journey of A Liars Funeral, its a refreshing slap in the face to find Red Flag bringing us straight back into familiar Slipknot territory, that unmistakable rolling riff and rumbling guitar tone starting the song. The song talks about fake people, as it seems in the chorus:

Theyll smother their own just to feel you
Theyll get you alone just to steal you
Theyll eat you alive just to kill you
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Past just saving, this is like escaping
Running wild in the middle of weeds
Eyes can't see me, careful with your breathing
Get away, or they get to feed
Strength's not enough, be defiant
You're looking for a reason to suffer, you'll find it
But if you want to live to be better, begin it
Your energy will keep you from getting exhausted and purge it

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't own me
You can't hold me
This is beginning
You are an ending

[Chorus]
They'll smother their own just to feel you
They'll get you alone just to steal you
They'll eat you alive just to kill you
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

[Verse 2]
Vultures salivate poison to exterminate
It's the dawn of the Renaissance
Emancipation, cattle on displacement
You want to reason, but there is no response
I won't allow this to happen
Another situation I feel like I'm trapped in
Nothing is my business and business is gone
I wish you all would fuck off
And go back to hell where you belong

Plague, don't panic
Don't believe the riddle that confuses you
Bitch, so manic
I can see the light that exposes you
So dramatic, now I'm so empathetic
Means the bigger the mouth that I can eat you with
Force of habit
God, you reek of your havoc
But consider the sources you've been tampering with

They'll get you alone just to steal you

Title: Spiders
Release Date: August 9, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-spiders-lyrics
Song Description: Spiders is the 10th song on We Are Not Your Kind, and is mainly in the time signature of 7/8 until the bridge where it changes to 4/4. It reverts to 7/8 in the 3rd verse and last chorus.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Well, you can go it alone or keep it in between
The pages of the books you burn so no one gets to read
The fingers pull your stitches tight
But knowing someone's secret is not enough
Everyone's a little bit a lot of the time

[Chorus]
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

[Verse 2]
When now is not the time, tomorrow disagrees
But your real world isn't ready to face the face behind the real me
Time to think it over, I'm over trying to overthink
I've had enough
Everybody's limited to what's on their mind

[Chorus]
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

Title: If Rain Is What You Want
Release Date: October 17, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-if-rain-is-what-you-want-lyrics
Song Description: If Rain Is What You Want is the fourteenth track on Slipknots .5: The Gray Chapter.

In an interview for Kerrang! Magazine, Corey Taylor spoke about this song:

This is the melancholy look at how people wanted us to deal with Pauls death, and listening to that song I see us on a stage, just in silence, and millions of people looking at us with ideas of how we should grieve already set in their minds, and maybe thats completely opposite with how we were trying to deal with it, and lyrically its us saying, Look, were the only ones that really understand what were going through. You can expect us to break down and cry, but at some point we have to stand back up.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
It's been years since anyone could be a friend
It's the fear that kills the feeling in the end
Can we face it? Can we shape it? Can we really die?
If rain is what you want... all you have to do is close your eyes
Just close your eyes...

[Verse 2]
I am watching resurrections start to crawl
Is there any chance in hell? Any chance at all?
Do we need it? Do we see it? Is it really there?
If rain is what you want... then take your seats, enjoy the fall
Enjoy the fall

[Chorus]
The only thing deeper than my last breath
The only thing darker than my last death
Is the panic, the static, I've come back from the dead
But my cities... will never sleep again

[Bridge]
In these diamonds, we're left with colored glass
As pressure takes its toll, we will outlast
But you can't break my heart
As long as I can be myself, I'll never fall apart
And you can't take me in
If I'm not broken, break me down
So I will never feel alone again

Title: Me Inside
Release Date: June 29, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-me-inside-lyrics
Song Description: Me Inside was the first song that Jim Root (#4) recorded with Slipknot.



It did not appear on the original version of Slipknot, however, when Frail Limb Nursery and Purity were removed because of copyright reasons, it replaced them as track 8.

When the copyright issues were rescinded, and Slipknot released a 19-track Digipak version of the album (as was common with all Roadrunner Records albums of the time), the original track-listing was kept and Me Inside was included as track 16.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Corey Taylor & Clown]
Inside, inside, inside, inside
Inside, inside, inside, inside

[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
Giving in to what has got me
Bleeding claustrophobic, scarred
Severed me from all emotion
Life is just too fucking hard
Snap, your face was all it took
'Cause this need ain't doin' me no good
Fall on my face, but can't you see?
This fucking life is killing me

[Pre-Chorus: Corey Taylor & Clown]
Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside

[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
Too far gone, I'm catatonic
Leaving you to criticize
Empty shell and running naked
All alone, lobotomized
Back and forth between my hang-ups
It isn't easy to be hated
Where do you go? What do you do?

Title: Eeyore
Release Date: June 29, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-eeyore-lyrics
Song Description: Eeyore is the secret track at the end of Scissors, after some adlib dialogue at the 16:30 mark. On the 10th anniversary edition and on reissues since then, it is listed as a separate track.

The end of the song samples Ice Cube saying Take that motherfuckers!, from Mans Best Friend.

Live versions of the song were included on Disasterpieces and 9.0: Live.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Oh

Oh, the fucking sacred heart of Jesus

Title: Nomadic
Release Date: October 15, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-nomadic-lyrics
Song Description: Nomadic is the ninth track on Slipknots 2014 album .5: The Gray Chapter, possibly alluding to their former bassist Paul Gray, who died of a drug overdose in 2010.

In an interview for Kerrang! Magazine, Corey Taylor spoke about this song:

Nomadic is the other side of Goodbye  thats when the anger starts up. And its almost like if Goodbye is slowly getting to your feet, Nomadic is the sprint that happens once you do get to your feet. And theres almost a misogynistic kind of vibe to it, where its like men shouldnt cry, or are afraid to show their true feelings, and this is the gnarly, aggressive repercussions of trying to hold it in, and standing out and trying to put on a sense of bravado when inside youre really just sinking fast in the quicksand.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Let's skip all the histrionics
Not again, not another excuse
The epidemic is codependent
Biting off more than your mouth can chew
Don't forget to convalesce your secrets
I don't wanna be a man today
For all you know, I'm the silver in the bullet
I am the trigger that will make you all obey

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going to make you cry tonight
I'm going to make you hate me

[Chorus]
Inside all my flaws again (I can't let go)
In spite of you, I'm lost again (I still don't know)
Disguises show me
What am I if I am only?
The status quo is not a punishment...
But now it feels like home

[Verse 2]
Your association finds you guilty
Starting with the end of the day
Black and white is such a fascist feeling
Right or wrong, and nothing to say
The last good bipeds cleaning up the fingerprints
Unappreciated medical fiends
Confiscate another classic inbred
Fuck it all, light the acetylene

Who could ask for a better disciple?
What's the point? I'm not sure I can
I'll never dig another grave
I'm afraid of what I'll find
If it hurts, then you're too old
I'll take your shit and give you fucking gold

Title: Diluted
Release Date: June 29, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-diluted-lyrics
Song Description: Diluted continues the themes of misanthropy and self-hatred that flow throughout Slipknots self-titled record. Musically, it is a fast-paced nu-metal song that makes use of several vocal effects throughout the verses in order to give a fractured feel to the track.
Lyrics:

[Intro: Corey Taylor]
I'm cold, I'm ugly
I'm always confused by everything
I can stare into a thousand eyes
But every smile hides a bold-faced lie

[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
It itches, it seethes, it festers and breathes
My heroes are dead, they died in my head
Thin out the herd, squeeze out the pain
Something inside me has opened up again

[Pre-Chorus: Corey Taylor]
Thoughts of me exemplified, all the little flaws I have denied
Forget today, forget whatever happened
Every day, I see a little more of overall deficiencies
I'm nothing short of being one complete catastrophe

[Chorus: Corey Taylor & Chris Fehn]
What the hell (The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell (The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?

I keep my scars from prying eyes, incapable of ever knowing why
Somebody breathe, I've got to have an answer
Why am I so fascinated by bigger pictures, better things?
But I don't care what you think, you'll never understand me

Will you come testify in the court of myopic opinion?

Lyrics:

[Intro]
This is the year where hope fails you
The test subjects run the experiments
And the bastard you know is the hero you hate
But cohesion is possible if we try
There's no reason, there's no lesson
No time like the present
Tell me right now, what have you got to lose?
What have you got to lose except your soul?
Who's with us?

[Verse 1]
I fight for the unconventional
My right, and it's unconditional
I can only be as real as I can
The disadvantage is, I never knew the plan
This isn't just a way to be a martyr
I can't walk alone any longer
I fight for the ones who can't fight
And if I lose, at least I tried

[Chorus]
(We) We are the new diabolic
(We) We are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
(We) We are the pulse of the maggots

I won't be the inconsequential
I won't be the wasted potential
I can make it as severe as I can
Until you realize you'll never take a stand
It isn't just a one-sided version
We've dealt with a manic subversion
I won't let the truth be perverted
And I won't leave another victim deserted

[Chorus]
(We) We are the new diabolic
(We) We are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it

We fight 'til no one can fight us
We live, and no one can stop us
We pull when we're pushed too far
And the advantage is, the bottom line is
We never had to fight in the first place
We only had to spit back in their face
We won't walk alone any longer
What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger

Title: Skeptic
Release Date: October 15, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-skeptic-lyrics
Song Description: Skeptic is the sixth track on Slipknots .5: The Gray Chapter.

In an interview for Kerrang! Magazine, Corey Taylor spoke about this song:

This is definitely about Paul, absolutely. And its a song about the kind of person that Paul was, just his love for not only music in general, but for this band, and just how amazing a personality he was. And the name Skeptic refers to the fact that when everything was down and out, when everyone would be in the dumps and negative, or just feeling like nothing could get done, he would be the guy who was completely sceptical of all the odds against us. Hed just be like, Screw that, were gonna do this, and were gonna do it amazingly. He was the beating heart of it, and this song is a celebration of who he was.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Only when the fates commiserate
Do we get a little taste as unique?
The libertine know what I mean?
Hiroshima on a Sunday
You had a gift, you were a gift
But there's always a goddamn catch
Blessing and a curse, you made it work
The universe seems so much smaller
Legend, bastard, best friend, why?
Why do the limits have to realign?
Hero, martyr, mystery, God
He was the best of us

[Chorus]
The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you

[Verse 2]
Never be the same, I want the blame
To be assigned to the guiltiest one
It can't be done because the son
Was the victim they arrested
I'm so fucking pissed, at all of this
You gotta know that you are sorely missed
Miracles are real, they help you heal
They make you feel like things will get better
Father, brother, scapegoat, why?
Why did we only get this time?
Fighter, icon, skeptic, God
Stop taking the best of us

Title: The Blister Exists
Release Date: May 21, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-the-blister-exists-lyrics
Song Description: Its about how everything that they have said in their songs does exist and is part of the bands inner workings. Kind of like I guess you could call it a song on how complacent (not caring at all) people are can be sometimes, and that as much as he tries to show himself..he still is called the same thing (chemical burns and the animalistic, Im just another hardline pseudo-sadisticim just another blank face, pushing-button pull the rage)
Lyrics:

[Intro]
One, two, three
Yeah
Drop it

[Verse 1]
Bones in the water and dust in my lungs
Absorbing archaic like a sponge
The ultimate way is the way you control
But can you stay if you detach your soul?
Bury the present and squeeze out the past
The ones you endear to never last
Chemical burns and the animalistic
I'm just another hardline pseudo-statistic

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel this?
I'm dying to feel this
Can you feel this?

[Verse 2]
Blood on the paper and skin on my teeth
Trying to commit to what's beneath
To find the time is to lose the momentum
You learn the lessons and immediately forget them
Automatic and out of my reach
Consult all the waste to find the key
Minimal life and the polysyllabic
I'm just another blank page, push the button, pull the rage

Title: Yen
Release Date: August 5, 2022, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-yen-lyrics
Song Description: Yen is the fourth track off of Slipknots seventh album The End, So Far.

In an interview with Metal Hammer, vocalist Corey Taylor revealed that the track is a love song to his wife Alicia Dove.

Yen is actually a slang for yearning, he explains. Its old-school, but I liked the application because the song is about that yearning you have for the person youre actually with, which is a very distinct and different yearning from the yearning for the people that you dont have. To me, thats why this song is worth singing about; its about my wife, and she brings things out in me that I never knew existed.

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
You're the sin that I've been waitin' for
The hands around my throat
It's all I can think about
The smell of sweat and blood
I would feed you all my pleasures
Just to drown in all of yours
Have you heard of me?
Are you hurting me?
Let me savor what I'm waiting for
A chance to make me choke
You're all I can think about
The taste is red and rust
Can I hold you in my mouth
Until I fade into this form?
Can you cover me?
Will you breathe for me?

As the knife goes in, cut across my skin
When my death begins

Title: Gematria (The Killing Name)
Release Date: August 20, 2008, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-gematria-the-killing-name-lyrics
Song Description: Gematria is a type of numerology adopted in Judaism.  By ascribing a numerical value to different letters, words can have a different value via this binary cipher/code.

Corey Taylor may be saying that America is a Killing Name, meaning death, to those outside of it.  In this interpretation, we will burn your cities down refers to the foreign policy in the wake of September 11th.

In a Kerrang! Interview analyzing each track on All Hope is Gone Taylor said,

This song is not about my disgust of America, but more about its people. I love my country; I love the people that defend my country. I love the people that still exercise their right to disagree and voice their discontent, but there are a lot of people who are disguising politics as religion and dictating taste and turning it into policy, and that hurts me.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
12/08/73, that was all I got, and now you got me
All I ever really wanted was to take the blame
I will go down in history and not down in flames
Meningitis, I will survive this
Dry sockets and a schizophrenic crisis
The Time of the Nine has begun
Get out of the way or you will suffer as one
Oh, this is so typical, apocalyptical
Hanging on abysmal release, Jesus
I don't need this, don't wanna be this
Icon in the making, my hands are fucking shaking

Title: Lech
Release Date: October 15, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-lech-lyrics
Song Description: Lech is the seventh track on Slipknots .5: The Gray Chapter.

In an interview for Kerrang! Magazine, Corey Taylor spoke about this song:

Lech is one of the other tunes talking about that guilt in your gut, and just taking a look at yourself, and basically beating yourself up for having these very human feelings. In the grief process you can get angry at yourself, and you can also get angry at the person that you lost  this person that you loved so much  and when you lose them you get really angry, whether its about their choices or the fact that you couldnt help them, and theres a certain amount of survivors guilt that comes with that. Why is he gone and not me? Its an amalgam of just outrageous, just insane grief that really drives you into a bunch of different crazy positions, and Lech is about that. And Lech refers to the word lecherous. It makes you feel like youre a bad person, and you have to fight your way through that, and its a long process, but once you come out the other side of it you feel a lot better for it.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I know why Judas wept, motherfucker

[Verse 1]
The fires burn on the summit
Shining a light on the ones I've killed
Survivor's guilt, undetermined
I could murder the world in all the blood I've spilled
Banishment sequestered and conquered
To hell with your intelligence
Just figure out your common sense
No one is bulletproof, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'll eat the skins of my brothers
The alabaster bones will make a perfect wall
Can I fill in the cracks of these feelings
With every terrible piece or maybe nothing at all?
Selfishness, take credit for everything
What more could you ask for?
And does it matter anymore?
No one is bulletproof, yeah

Title: Goodbye
Release Date: October 15, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-goodbye-lyrics
Song Description: Goodbye is the eighth track on Slipknots .5: The Gray Chapter.

In an interview for Kerrang! Magazine, Corey Taylor spoke about this song:

Goodbye is actually a song that refers to the day that we lost Paul, and the mood, or the scene, is basically set where the whole band was sitting in my house, and we were all so numb and so destroyed that we were just looking at each other, going, Fuck? What now? What just happened? The closest thing that I can even compare it to is if you were standing next to a bomb, and it goes off, and youre not physically hurt, but theres such a bombastic repercussion that happens with that, that youre just thrown for a loop, and thats what that song is. Its a piece of getting back together and hoping that we can all stand as one, and try to find some hope in one of the darkest days of this bands career.
Lyrics:

[Verse]
Come on over, come unglued
It's not easy to see all of you
Help yourselves, help is on the way
Well, there's nothing to lose, so now I have something to say
Maybe we can all recognize a moment of silence
Maybe we can finally agree on the same point of view
A long time ago we believed, and we were united
So the last thing on Earth I am ready to do is say "goodbye"

[Chorus]
A long time ago we discovered that nothing could stop us
This hasn't torn us apart, so nothing ever will
How can we know where we are if the sun is behind us?
But this moment will show us the rest of our lives
No one is going to save us this time

Title: All Hope Is Gone
Release Date: June 23, 2008, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-all-hope-is-gone-lyrics
Song Description: All Hope Is Gone is the fourth studio album by American metal band Slipknot. Released on August 20, 2008 by Roadrunner Records, the album was published in two versions: the standard album in a Compact Disc case and a special edition packaged in a six-fold digipak containing three bonus tracks, a 40 page booklet, and a bonus DVD with a documentary of the albums recording. Preparation for the album began in 2007, while recording started in February 2008 in the bands home state of Iowa. All Hope Is Gone is Slipknots first studio album since 2004s Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). Before the albums launch, Slipknot released a series of promotional images and audio samples from the album through various websites. All Hope Is Gone is considered the bands most eclectic-sounding album, incorporating elements from their previous three. All Hope Is Gone includes their brutal edge, such as the track All Hope Is Gone, reminiscent of songs such as (sic) from their debut self-titled album; slow burning, trippy elements such as Gehenna, reminiscent of Skin Ticket from their second album Iowa; and acoustics (Snuff), which was first introduced on Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses).

Lyrically, All Hope Is Gone centers on themes such as anger, disaffection, obsession, and the music industry. The album name also features a more prominent focus on politics than their previous albums. Slipknot promoted All Hope Is Gone on a world tour and at the Mayhem Festival. Generally well received by critics, the album reached the top position on nine record charts worldwide, including the Billboard 200the first Slipknot album to do so. It has been certified Platinum by the RIAA on the 10th of August 2010 for shipments in excess of 1,000,000 albums in the United States. It is the final studio album released by the band to include two longtime members: bassist and founding member Paul Gray, who was found dead in an Iowa hotel on May 24, 2010, almost two years after the release of All Hope Is Gone, and drummer Joey Jordison, who left the group in December 2013.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Corey Taylor, Corey Taylor, Clown, Chris Fehn & Paul Gray]
The state of the nation – violation
A broken promise is as good as a lie
The hell is humongous, the devil's among us
And we will burn 'cause we won't unite
What are we conceding for our freedom?
Why does anybody think we need 'em?
I would rather fight than let another die
We're the problem, but we're also the solution
All hope is gone
If you want it, come and take it from me
If you think you can, you still don't know me
Let me tell you, man, if I said it, I meant it
And I will always have the right to defend it
Fifty seconds, a hundred murders
The bill of rights is a bill of sale
What will you do when the war is over?
What will you do when your system fails?

[Chorus: Corey Taylor, Corey Taylor, Clown, Chris Fehn & Paul Gray]
We have made the present obsolete
What do you want? What do you need?

The wretched are the wounded
The hungry starve to death
In a place where no one goes
The air itself is a final breath
So discontinue the antiseptic care charade
As a cry of justice comes, a malignant fire fades
I am the reason your future suffers
I am the hatred you won't embrace
I am the worm of a pure gestation
I am the remedy, spit in my face
All your laws and rules are outdated
All your subjects are killing the kings
I can rattle off a million other reasons why
But does it matter when the only thing we love will die?

Title: Gently
Release Date: August 28, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-gently-lyrics
Song Description: This is one of 3 songs originating from the Basement Sessions recordings in 1993 which were used as a basis for later Slipknot songs. Originally written by Shawn Crahan in high school, Gently appeared as the second track on Slipknots official first self-distributed album, which they released on October 31, 1996.

When Corey Taylor joined the band, the intro was cut, and small changes were made to the lyrics. It was then rerecorded and included on Iowa.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
Gently my mind escapes
Into the relaxing world of pleasure
A pleasure that'll take my mind
Off the reality of my life
My past life... life as I know it now
And whatever may come, it slowly disappears
To somewhere in the back of my mind
It will remain there
Until I wish to retrieve it
[Interlude: Corey Taylor with Clown]

[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
Yes, I will stay here for a while, for I need the break
A break from the pressures of life
And everything that lays in the palm of life's hands
Ooh, life's hands
Yeah
Ooh
This mode is incredible
It's out of this world
Too bad I must always leave it
But that's life, yeah

Title: Circle
Release Date: May 25, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-circle-lyrics
Song Description: Circle is one of the few acoustic songs to appear on Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). Lyrically, Corey Taylor was inspired by meeting his father for the first time at the age of 30. Taylor previously defamed him in songs such as Diluted and Metabolic.

Members of Slipknot wrote half the song during the Iowa tour cycle in 2001, and finished it while recording Vol. 3 in 2003. The takes of the first verse and chorus were kept for the final mix.

Corey talked about the writing process of Circle in a recent Q&A:

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Give me the dust of my father
Stand on the face of the ancients
Bare the secret flesh of time itself

Follow me, I've come so far, I'm behind again
Follow me, I wish so hard, I'm there again
Follow me, follow me

[Chorus]
All that I wanted were things I had before
All that I needed, I never needed more
All of my questions are answers to my sins
All of my endings are waiting to begin

[Verse 2]
I know the way, but I falter
I can't be afraid of my patience
There's a sacred place Raziel keeps safe

Title: My Pain
Release Date: August 9, 2019, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-my-pain-lyrics
Song Description: There are multiple ways to interpret this song:
One is love and how much pain it can give you if it goes wrong, especially in abusive/manipulative relationships.
And the other one is how much pain, most likely emotional, can affect you as a person after certain events in your life, and at the same time physical pain lets you feel emotions/love when you can barely do so.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Pain, she loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free
To feel more of my pain

[Verse]
I'm your friend and I'm your shade
Do what you want, just remember it's for love
I'm your wall and I'm your rock
Don't run away, don't forget it's only love
I'm your chain and I'm your lock
There's no escape, just as long as I say, "Love"
I'm your death and I'm your cold
You end with me, remember, this was never love
(Love, love, love, love)
I'll take this
(Love, love, love, love)
And I'll take that
(Love, love, love, love)
I'll take you too
(Love, love, love, love)
You can never give too much

[Bridge]
Pain, she loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free, pain
Pain, she loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free
To feel our love, pain

Title: Get This
Release Date: June 29, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-get-this-lyrics
Song Description: This is a B-side/bonus track on the self-titled album which can be featured on the old digipak, and of course the 10th-anniversary edition. According to sites like SongMeanings, Get This is based on a nameless band that felt responsible for Slipknots success and believed they should always tour together, even though they sounded nothing alike. After constant pestering with Slipknot, Corey wrote the words to Get This and set the record straight.

At one time, Corey dedicated this song to every shitty ass poser fucking pussy band on the radio.

Song Description: A bonus track off Slipknots fourth studio album All Hope Is Gone, the song is a little slower and deeper then usual Slipknot songs. The song was also dedicated to their bassist Paul Gray who sadly passed away on May 24th, 2010.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
My friends are all hurting from moments and regrets
And charity laced with a lie
And still, we keep hoping to fix all the defects
And strengthen these seminal ties
We go on together, for better or worse
Our history is too real to hate
Now and forever, we stay until morning
And promise to fight for our fate

[Chorus]
'Til we die, 'til we die

[Verse 2]
The start of the journey is every bit worth it
I can't let you down anymore
The sky is still clearing, we're never afraid
And the consequence opens the door
I've never stopped to trying, I've never stopped to feeling
Like family is much more than blood
Don't go on without me, the piece that I represent
Compliments each and every one

[Chorus]
'Til we die, 'til we die
We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in

Lyrics:

[Intro: Corey Taylor]
My freedom is best
Whole country's on house arrest
And everyone's a suspect
You can't feel the flow because you died
Facedown on a "suicide"
The motherfucker's on self-destruct
Nobody guardin' your back, it's all a front
Save this, my rage is bliss
I'm takin' names and gettin' pissed

Where's Chuck D when ya need him?
You ain't shit, just a puddle on the bedspread
The maniac psycho
Cool J screamed the shit, but I still can't believe it
Man, it's funny that you scare me so
Just enough to fuck me up again and again
Hard life is hard as hell
Better back the fuck on up

None of us wonder what weather you're under
You're making it perfectly clear

Lights ain't on, shit ain't right
Never had peace but I gotta fight
Can you look in my eyes when my back's against the wall?
Slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me
You're all reality and sound bites
And the freedom is never in plain sight
The feelings, the question
The price is too human for fucking sake

Song Description: The final track on Slipknots third album.
Two versions of the song exist, the one on the album being edited to be shorter than the full-length version, which appears on the Vermilion single CD and the special edition of the album.

The song is about two personalities living in one same person. Even though both personalities hate each other, they need themselves to exist.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
We, too, feel alone
We, too, feel alone

We've, too, feel alone

Is that space that you call mine
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine

[Verse]
Where have I been all this time?
Lost in sliding fatal decline
I've been waiting for this to unfold, but
The pieces are only as good as the whole
Severed myself from my old life
Cut off the only thing that was bright
What If I never saw you again?
I'd die right next to you in the end

Is that space that you call mine

Song Description: I Am Hated is the 10th song on Slipknots sophomore studio release on Roadrunner Records Iowa. It can be interpreted as Corey feeling like a villain and that everyone is always against him due to how he, his band, and his lyrics for said band were viewed and discussed by the media, he also feels that he is hated as seen by the title and bridge.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
The whole world is my enemy, and I'm a walking target
Two times the devil with all the significance
Dragged and raped for the love of a mob
I can't stay because I can't be stopped
Eat motherfuckers alive who cross us
I know you're all tired of the same old bosses
Let me tell you how it's gonna be
I'm gonna kill anyone who steps up in front of me

[Verse 2]
Welcome to the same old fucking scam
Same old shit in a dead fad
Everybody wants to be so hard
Are you real or a second-rate sports card?
They all lost their dad or their wife just died
They never got to go outside, shut up
Nobody gives a fuck
It doesn't change the fact that you suck

[Chorus]
(We are) The anticancer
(We are) The only answer
Stripped down, we want you dead
But what's inside of me, you'll never know

Before you go, you should know you're breaking down
You'll be rotten by the time you're underground

Song Description: 11th song on the album, and it talks about how the narrator is feeling lost. Cancer and people are the only things he knows or they feel theyre the same thing. People are the cancer. He feels lonely like theres nothing to do. Running in circles no where to go. Hes only alive through other peoples empathy, but he also wants them to stop so he can die without anyone caring.

Inhabit the riddle and fill in the hovel
Wherein and herein, between us and near us
Zero and zero is nothing but zero

Come see my cage, built-in migraine

Title: Gehenna
Release Date: August 20, 2008, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-gehenna-lyrics
Song Description: Slipknot themselves described Gehenna as an eerily melodic song about obsession and self-loathing. Here, the speaker has become obsessed over a love interest, and try to fake a personality to please the person of his obsessions. Sometimes Gehenna is referred to as a name for the world of demons, mirrored to ours.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Do you believe?
Do you fade like a dream?
Let me hear you breathe, let me watch as you sleep
The sparrow's eyes
Promises shift into judgments
I cannot deny that you were designed for my punishments

[Verse 2]
The blood and the body control the cut, so it's seamless
Show me your heart, show me the way to complete this
Tethered to a scene, I treasure, can you help me?
I sever, God, it's perfect, it's never really perfect
Now, I can finally be myself 'cause I don't wanna be myself

[Chorus]
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you

Title: The Shape
Release Date: August 28, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-the-shape-lyrics
Song Description: In The Shape, someone is experiencing a significant problem. He is really confused and does not want to come out and say it because hes not sure how to deal with it. He uses a lot of metaphors trying to get out his feelings, but its so hard that he can only manage to beat around the bush for say.                      Some people I know said my personal interpretation of the shapes lyrics is someone trying to become someone else (changing their "shape) and failing".

The title of the song could also be a reference to, or inspired by, the villain of the 1978 classic Horror film Halloween.  Though many know him today as Michael Myers, he was originally referred to as The Shape in the films end credits and in the script by director John Carpenter.

Lead singer Corey Taylor is a huge fan of 80s Sci-Fi and horror films, so much so that he starred in the 2020 documentary In Search of Darkness Part II, a 4 hour documentary about 80s horror movies with interviews and insights from many famous directors, including John Carpenter.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Destroy

[Verse 1]
Too tragic to stay with you
Too static to try for you
These scars, they swallow hard
The part of the past that's hollow and dark
Too horrid to kill for you
Too sordid to die with you
Unstable as always, come down
Everything else is just dust and sound

Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)

I'd give it all away
Come take it all away
You can't resent the fear
Somebody, tell me how I got here
I'd give it all to you
Come take it, it's all for you

You gotta figure it out before you make things difficult
It's not a word, it's a problem, the problem was easy
Draw your conclusions, solutions?
Anybody else wanna run?
Contorting, distorting, I am undone
One less propaganda nightmare fixture

Title: (515)
Release Date: August 28, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-515-lyrics
Song Description: Track 1 on Iowa, Slipknots 2nd album.  (515),  is named after an area code in Iowa, Slipknots home state and the name of this album.  515 is also the sum of 9 consecutive prime numbers (41 + 43 + 47 + 53 + 59 + 61 + 67 + 71 + 73), with Slipknot famously containing 9 members.



While they were recording Iowa, Sids grandfather died and Ross Robinson decided to use Sids grief and anger as part of the recording process. If you listen carefully you can hear sobs interspersed with the reversed screams of the word Death.



According to Shawn Crahan:

He was crying so much that he just kept getting more and more out of time.  The takes ended up as the albums harrowing intro track.




Yeah, that screaming and crying and breaking down that you hear at the beginning of the album, thats me. Obviously, it was edited, things were done to it, reversed, pushed around in areas, to make it what it was but we if we actually played just the raw recording of it, I dont think many people would be able to stomach it. It was pretty brutal, but thats all Ive ever known how to do, express myself through music and art. I could get it out without just wanting to destroy everything. I didnt know whether it was going to be used or not, that didnt even matter. The intention wasnt for it to be used on the album; it was just so that I could get it out of my system. Everyone in the studio was balling with me, and I just let it rip.

My grandfather got really sick and it was right at the end of the recording cycle, there were only like 2 or 3 days left so I was planning to get my parts done quick and then fly out immediately to see him, he was in the hospital. It got up to the last day in the studio and he passed away. I didnt make it out there, needless to say. I went into the studio, you can also hear some of this in our People=St song, theres a bunch of us doing gang vocals, which I did after this next part, but I went into the studio and was like Turn it on, turn this st on and record. There wasnt any music or anything, I just went in and let it all go.

Title: Metabolic
Release Date: August 28, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-metabolic-lyrics
Song Description: Corey says This song is basically Diluted Part II that is about my dad. It is about being so enraged yet being so impotent because there is nothing you can do about it. "It is about that time of the morning when you are sitting in bed, and you are crying uncontrollably, and you are trying not to feel, but all you can do is feel because every time you shut your eyes, its there. It is probably one of the most personal songs I have ever written just for the fact that even though I never knew my father and even though I have never met him, I feel like I am turning into him. I have no mental picture of what he is supposed to be, but sometimes I wonder if I am doing the things he used to do. Its definitely a pissed off, heavy, fuck you, I dont give a shit because nobody told me who I was because I had to figure it out for myself song. In Metabolic, Corey is trying to get across that he isnt perfect. This song is a little psychotic because with the quote  The hardest part was knowing that I could never be you he is saying he knew he wanted to be like his father, but he was too imperfect to fill his shoes.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Gone, I couldn't murder your promise
Right before my eyes
The revolutions of my psychosis
Kept me outta the way
Once inside, all I hold is ash
Fall, suppressing every feeling
I'm in so much pain
I have every fuckin' right to hate you
I can't take it

[Pre-Chorus]
The hardest part was knowing
That I could never be you
Now all I do is sit around
And wish I could forget you

[Chorus]
My demise, I took a life worth living
And made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming
(Stop) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me
(Stop) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me
(Stop) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me

Who are you to me? Who am I to you?
Is this a lesson in nepotistic negligence?
By default, you are my only link to the outside
Psychosomatic suicide
Where were you when I was down?
Can you show me a way
To face every day with this face?
Goodbye

[Chorus]
My demise, I took a life worth living
And made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming

[Bridge]
Oh, when I blur my eyes, they make the whole world breathe
I see you fucking me
And I am absolutely controlling every urge to mutilate
The one and only answer, so much for memories
I wanna dress in your insecurities
And be the perfect you, I'm through
I'm outstretched out for all to loathe
Here we go, the ultimate irony
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
My demise, I took a life worth living
And made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming
(Stop) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me

Title: The One That Kills the Least
Release Date: October 15, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-the-one-that-kills-the-least-lyrics
Song Description: The One That Kills The Least is the tenth track on Slipknots .5: The Gray Chapter.

In an interview for Kerrang! Magazine, Corey Taylor spoke about this song:

That song is a moment of melancholy, where youre looking at all the problems in your life, and youre trying to put everything in perspective, and you realize that the decisions you make can come back to haunt you, because of something like, in our case, losing Paul. The choices that you make are really starting to affect everything around you, and it comes down to the point where the one that kills the least still kills us all. Where every action has an equal and opposite reaction, so its really about dealing with the negative side effects of your choices in the grief process.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I don't seem to care today
I mirror what I love with what I hate
Empty ways can cloud your eyes
I only know because I tried
So come with me, come with me
Let's meet our contestants
That have no better time to play the game

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna give it away, underneath the citadels
Buried deep with your guilt and regrets
Leading in the dark, everything is wonderful
I don't care, I don't want to forget
Why is it a crime? It's none of your business
I prefer to be in hell by myself
Turn the other cheek and tell it to somebody
Who refuses to forgive when nothing was taken

[Chorus]
No one else survives, I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes, alone in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all

[Verse 2]
Hidden in the rubble
Everybody's got a story to tell
What do I need? Eliminate the possible
All that's left is a man in a cell
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe a decision
Is the better way to go, the better way to be
I've got my demons, go get your own
Save another number, don't forget to hate me

[Chorus]
No one else survives, I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes, lost in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all

Title: New Abortion
Release Date: August 28, 2001, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-new-abortion-lyrics
Song Description: That is for every fan we have who feels disorientated, especially kids who come from towns like we did. Its basically a new definition of abortion for the fact that these kids are born with life, but that is basically all they have. They have no chance for a future and have no chance of finding themselves. They have no inside influence that is going to push them in the right direction. They fit, and they stagnate, which when I think about it, real abortion is better than that fucking bullshit. These people are born with life, but they still have to endure it. These are the kids you see shooting up schools, losing their minds over sitting in their rooms and not having anywhere to go, so that is my testimony to these kids  that I know where they are coming from. With the quote Im ethereal, my children are legion, serial. They stick to my skin like beloved cysts. Corey is getting across that all of us maggots stick together, we are one, and Corey feels like we are all his children, and he is the guiding light to show us the way.

With the quote Everywhere you look, its like they know. Their fingerprints are hidden by control. He is stating that these parents/authority figures think they know every little thing about everything. The reality is they have no clue what the younger generation is capable of, and they fail to realize this, with all these rules and restrictions.

With the Quote You cant take my soul away from me Corey is saying you do not control me, and you never will. Meaning I am for me. Not for you, get out of here, I am not your puppet.

With the quote What do you need to see, you feel the impact? He is saying do you need to be shown what we are capable of? Youre not going to take our word for it because of your stubborn and think your right.

The basic overlay of New Abortion is we maggots need to stick together to survive. We will not stand to be pushed around any longer. We will not be looked down upon anymore because there is so much more depth, so much more than what these rude people see. They look, they judge, and thats the end of it. They dont bother to wander beneath the surface of things. They think theyre right and really theyre so wrong its pitiful they do not realize we maggots are done with the belittling. Time to take control.

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm ethereal
My children are legion, serial
They stick to my skin like beloved cysts
I tear away with my nails and teeth and fists
Touch the hands of inverted saints
Follow my heart through the threaded pain
Callow man is a sentinel screaming
I see the future, the future is bleeding

[Verse 2]
Sores
Every goddamn minute, I can feel 'em now
Like a virus, you will never kill me now
Goin' underground, comin' on like hepatitis
We're out, and you can't reshape us
Another bug in the construct
Tearing up the main bus B
Zeros and ones are everything, execute me

[Chorus]

Gotta retract, everybody get back
What is this? It's like a big conspiracy
Fields of dejected, morbid progeny
They always say that it's always our fault
But everything we say is taken with a grain of salt

Man, it's always the same if we talk or complain
We only wanna upset the balance
How's it feel to be the new abortion?
The only generation to suffer extortion

[Chorus]
Everywhere you look, it's like they know
Their fingerprints are hidden by control
This is where the line is drawn, see

[Bridge]
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
[Chorus]
Everywhere you look, it's like they know
Their fingerprints are hidden by control
This is where the line is drawn, see
You can't take my soul away from me

Everywhere you look, it's like they know

This is where the line is drawn, see
Oh, you can't take my soul away from me

Idiotic sense of yourself, are you that dumb?
Entire legion of me, totalitarian

'Cause I can't stand it, planned it, gonna crash-land it
In other words, consider me branded
Another version of me, another version of you
Both barrels, what you gonna do?

Chaos, it's just the beginning
Every promise I made, I'm rescinding
Center mass in the middle of the monster
I'm getting tired of drowning the constant
Cry for help, it's debatable
The only reason that you love me is I'm hated by all
Come on, come see dysfunction
I guess we're gonna leave it open for discussion
Who am I? Where am I going?
Maybe I'm looking in the wrong direction
Maybe I'm looking for any direction

Shallow graves and deepest fears

Song Description: The Virus of Life, the 13th track on Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses), details a mans obsession with a woman, and through this obsession, stalks and kills her.



 He thinks this desire is his virus. Unlike most Slipknot songs, this one is presented in a whisper-like voice.
Lyrics:

I can see you, but you can't see me
I could touch you, and you wouldn't even feel me
Wait a second, and you'll settle down
I'm just waiting till you really let your guard down
You're relaxed, you're sublime, you're amazing
You don't even know the danger you're facing
If I'm quiet, I'll slide up behind you (Behind you)
And if you hear me, I'll enjoy trying to find you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been with you all day
I'm trying to stay calm
I'm impatient, and it's really hard to breathe
I'm going to empty you and fill you in with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Just keep the violence down
Not yet, don't make a sound
Oh, God, I'm feeling it
It's reaching fever pitch

You're almost ready now
I'm gonna love you now
I'm gonna put you down

But my heart is still untamed
I learn my lessons, I've conquered death

I'll paint your bones to match my eyes
They're the darkest I have ever seen
Until I'm lucid, I can't be told
I know my voices, they tell me to believe

[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
Another fuckin' accident out of control
All the attitudes will never change
My imitations are leading the way
I can't accept that I still don't find this strange
In light of my ability to feel denial
I walk away from everything with just a smile
The agony of coming home has gone away

Title: Frail Limb Nursery
Release Date: June 29, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-frail-limb-nursery-lyrics
Song Description: Frail Limb Nursery serves as an intro/prelude to the song Purity.  The track contains samples from fictional story about a girl called Adrianne Purity Knight, who was buried alive in a box by an obsessed lover.  The original website that reported the story had recorded audio samples of Purity imprisoned.  These samples were allegedly used on Frail Limb Nursery, so both songs had to be pulled from the album because of copyright/plagiarism issues.

Both tracks were replaced by the track Me Inside on a Re-issue.

After the reissue the band won a court case, which allowed them to play Purity live.  The 10 year anniversary version of Slipknot thus has both Purity and Me Inside on it.
Lyrics:

[Interlude]
Go on, what about the boy?
She lay as though she were in a trance
With her long eyelashes fluttering like she was dreaming
She said to him, "I lie beyond the sea"
And then all of a sudden, her head dipped back, and she vanished
Gone, gone without a trace
She's never coming back
Do you know what it's like to live with that?
No one knows what it's like
The only one who knew me, gone
I know what you want, and I can give it to you
I am hungry and tired
Have you ever seen God?See Slipknot LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also likeEmbed

All that sucks dies

Title: The Burden
Release Date: October 21, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-the-burden-lyrics
Song Description: The Burden is the second track on the bonus disk of Slipknots .5: The Gray Chapter.

In an interview for Kerrang! Magazine, Corey Taylor spoke about the song:

The Burden is really about the weight  carrying the weight of something as horrendous as losing a friend, losing a band member, losing family, losing a person who for 15 years has been on this road with you. And carrying that, and realising that not only are they not going to be on the rest of the road with you, physically, but realising that there are going to be nights where you struggle with it. There are going to be nights where you sit bolt-upright in bed and think to yourself, Fuck, what could I have done? And people can accept it as much as they want, but its just the reality of it.
Lyrics:

There's God
Can I feed you again?
Will I have to stay dumb?
You can feel, and it begins
But I know inside this heart attack
I can see through your eyes
I'm terrified of everything
But it's no real surprise
Because the parasites are dancing closer
All this sacrilegion warns in posters
Can you handle it?

[Verse 2]
In the dark
Why I think I'm alone?
I sweat through my visions
I'm going too cold
Today is a tragedy
In the mouth of the mad
But that doesn't matter now
I've come home relaxed
I'm curled up in a ball and shaking
I'm hiding from the hell I'm making
I can't believe the chance I'm taking
Is there any other way? Is there any other way?

Title: Override
Release Date: October 21, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-override-lyrics
Song Description: Override is the first track on the bonus disk of Slipknots .5: The Gray Chapter.

In an interview with Kerrang! Magazine, Corey Taylor spoke about the song:

Override is another song about maybe some of the bands that have come in the wake of this bands absence, and how certain groups have taken music in perhaps a more negative direction, and I dont mean lyrically or just from an outside thing, but just the way music is treated, much more like a commodity than creativity, and this is us basically saying that Okay, your time is done. Were not going to allow you to turn music into car insurance or hamburgers and shit like that.'
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
The ghosts have given up, familiar haunts have had enough
Too much thought will give you doubt, now they found you
It's safer in a cage, they can tell you what to say
All your dreams come with a price, so they own you
But what did you expect?
Was it too much to protect?
Did you understand they had selfish intentions
When they were pulling you in opposite directions?

[Chorus]
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
We are the override
We are the override

[Verse 2]
The dead don't know, the dead are lonely, a fascination fades
When this mercy execution says it's over
You follow as preferred, now their plans are undeterred
Who can bring them in to supersede? it's over
Even hate starts out as love
Sometimes when it's all you want
Maybe satisfaction will take you for granted
When all that's left is the emotion you abandoned

You are judged to be afraid
You are simple and unchanged
We believe you should give up

Title: Wherein Lies Continue
Release Date: August 20, 2008, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-wherein-lies-continue-lyrics
Song Description: Slipknot Wiki

Its a dressing down of the world as we know it. Not just about America, it kinda goes up against any civilization that takes themselves too seriously and where the "leaders are so pretentious that they think they are deemed to speak for the people, it all comes down to the fact that we have to save ourselves."

10th Track on All Hope Is Gone.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Thou shalt not

[Verse 1]
Kill your fathers, destroy another life
Question everything we clung to for years
Live forever, design a better death
Confuse a liar with a savior from fear
Create a myth and separate the chosen ones
Adolescent independence, dominion
I only wanna believe in fucking anything
But now my conscience is contradicting everything

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear

[Verse 2]
Tell your mothers they have no sons or daughters
Blame yourselves because your children are mine
We are orphans, but we are not forgotten
And we will find a way to save us this time
We can run, but we are tired of running
We're dropping seconds in a glass 'til we die
We only wanna believe in fucking everything
But we're alive, and we're not accepting anything

I won't control or restrain
Things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger, better
They gave to me, now I give to you
The means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger, better, more

[Bridge]
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves

[Verse 3]
I will never become another piece
Inside the paralytic construct I hate
Live forever, well I would rather die
At least I'd know I wasn't theirs to create
This is yours, but you had better choose
Before they take away your right to decide
I guess I'll never believe in fucking anything
But my solace is I can handle everything
[Pre-Chorus 3]
The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear
Obliteration

[Chorus]
I won't control or restrain
Things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger, better
They gave to me, now I give to you
The means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger, better

Release Date: May 25, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-prelude-30-lyrics
Song Description: The intro track to Vol 3: (The Subliminal Verses), Slipknots third studio album, released on May 25, 2004. Whereas the first two albums opened with eerie noise and sample collages, Vol. 3 opens with a very haunting and melodic piece. It serves as a preview of the (at the time) new direction Slipknot was taking.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I don't know why I never told you
I don't know why I never tried
When we shed these bitter skins again (Skins again)
All the reasons come to life

[Chorus]
But now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over

[Verse 2]
I don't know why you never asked me
And I don't know why you never cared
When we hide these little sins again (Sins again)
All the reasons have to die

Ain't nobody gonna cut me, corrupt me, instruct me, consequently

What's the matter with my image: the balance or the presence?
Older and still blown out, follow me, I know where we're going now
Pentagrams, penitentiaries, I've been here for centuries
I'm a product of the system, the price you can't resist
Fuck, I bless where I spit, cross the ground, get over it
Massacre disaster is the perfect one we need today

Title: Finale
Release Date: September 30, 2022, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-finale-lyrics
Song Description: The title of this song, along with the title of the record and the fact that this is the final song on the album both seem to indicate that this was potentially meant as a sort of swan song for Slipknot. Being their final album signed to Roadrunner Records, the future of the group and further releases are now uncertain; the songs lyrics along with its melodic and emotional delivery further evidence this and appear to mirror Coreys thoughts and reflections on the bands journey from the start all the way up to now, and ultimately sum up the message behind the records title; they dont want this to be the end.but theres no guarantee its not.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay
'Cause I like it here (I like it here)
I know it's the same, it happens every day
But I like it here (I like it here)
I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay
'Cause I like it here (I like it here)
I know it's the same, it happens every day
But I like it here (I like it here)
I like it here

[Verse 1]
The sentiment, the sad things
The punishments, the bad things
The cellular, the solenoid
The outer reach, the inner void
I keep repeating older answers
The questions are all brand-new
Does the room seem smaller these days?
Does the road seem long to you?
The accidents, the bitter pills
The populace, the stronger wills
The innocence, the common sense
The rare occasions exist

[Chorus]
I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay
'Cause I like it here (I like it here)
I know it's the same, it happens every day
But I like it here (I like it here)

Couldn't tell you, don't know where to begin

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Child of burning time
Child of burning time

[Verse 1]
My only consolation is all lies
The apex of my consequence is dying here tonight
Winter hasn't ended, and it always looks like rain
I can't remember anything, anything
Inside the absolution, we succumb
And appetites are bittersweet, I think I'm going numb
A chance to give up Avarice has marked my one regret
The child of burning time is gone, he hasn't come back yet

[Verse 2]
Before I tell my story, please, consider who I am
I missed my window years ago, I'm doing all I can
A tragedy is commonplace, but in the end, they go away
My skin is still the only stain I'm left to wear in shame

[Pre-Chorus]
I cut my name into my heart
I'll tear it all apart

Until this war is over, I won't ever lose my rage

I guess I'll never know

Release Date: May 25, 2004, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-welcome-lyrics
Song Description: Welcome to the new gen. Its about how new gen parents are in tuned to how the new generation is. Were their product, of their conduct. They made us, but are they proud of how we turned out? Do they even care about us? You distract us and expect certain reactions that we may or may not give. You discard us and make us feel retarded. Or its about how kids with special needs (retardation etc) get discarded and not cared about wanting a better one. As far as the gen knows they dont because they werent raised to know. Clawed away from the human clay The shaped us and made us their clay to shape and build, but we break away and were not what the shaped us to be or want us to be. Stunt our growth from our souls to our throats You stunt our souls and our ability to be who we want to be because the parents arent in tuned. You cut our throats to shut us up, not caring what we have to say or what our new gen is about. This is the catalyst, the alpha, the first breed Were breed to be the best of the best, but we didnt want to be. You didnt raise us to be. The third verse is us trying to teach the parents that a new gen is among them and that they have to learn and adapt, but they refuse saying Thats not how we were raised biting our hand as we feed you. We can only take so much of this before we stop trying to help. We save you from our sins because we dont want to hear what you think or that we dont wanna be with you or deal with you.
Lyrics:

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I am a product of your conduct
The uncontrollable urges that made me
Have made us all, are you proud? Do you even care?
You taught us all to lie, that's how we made it here
You should've buried the truth with your secrets
But you were far too impressed with your pretense
Now, as far as I know, I don't know anything
'Cause you made damn sure I wasn't anything

[Chorus]
Distractions, reactions
The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, retarded
Before I let you go, you have to let me
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Clawed away from human clay
We are the broken shards the art disarray
Before you condemn, you rape them, feed us meconium
Stunt our growth from our souls to our throat, cut
You shouldn't wall us up with your apathy
But you did, and now you're only growing enemies
This is the catalyst, the alpha, the first breed

Constantly biting my hand as I feed you
Maybe now you'll understand severity
I'll sum it up with the best of amount of brevity
Welcome to the transformation
Welcome to annihilation
Welcome to the man that wanted
Everything but couldn't have it
[Chorus]
Distractions, reactions
The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, retarded
Before I let you go, you have to let me
Much to my surprise, I will wake up
And follow the path of the ones I am made of
But this time I won't give in
I will save you from my sins (Yeah)

[Outro]
Save you from my sins (Yeah)
Oh, save you from my sins1Embed

Title: Be Prepared for Hell
Release Date: October 21, 2014, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-be-prepared-for-hell-lyrics
Song Description: Be Prepared For Hell is the twelth track on Slipknots .5: The Gray Chapter.

In an interview for Kerrang! Magazine, Corey Taylor spoke about this song:

This is hard, because its a song that Clown wrote, not only musically but lyrically, and thats him singing it. What I get from it is the expectations that come in your mind when youre dealt such a heavy blow, like losing Paul. The lyrics go, Be prepared for Hell, and I say oh well / Just tell me when I can open my eyes and realise Ive died. So you may look like youre together, but youre not. On the inside, youre really starting to deteriorate, so its the perfect set-up for what is the next song
Lyrics:

[Intro]
I can't get out, or I'll die
Just let me be
I'll never be never

[Verse]
Be prepared for hell, and I say, "Oh, well
Just tell me when I can open my eyes" and realize I've died
Be prepared for hell, and I say, "Oh, well

[Verse 1]
I feel it now, a new restraint
The fool is only he who fools again (Again), again (Again), again (Again)
I needed all the pain you saved
To wash across my face like time began (Began), began (Began), began (Began)

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody lies when they say "forever"
No one else will understand
Pull the stitches tight until we sever
Break me in your open hands

[Chorus]
Please, forget me not
I need your simple pleasures to be god
And please, my sweet De Sade
Just take my heart and twist me into knots

[Verse 2]
I know I never had a chance (Chance), chance (Chance)
Oh, I know I'm wretched and I stand (Stand), stand (Stand)
Seeking all the things you have
If I die with you, it's worth the life, life, life, life (life)

Only you will only do
Everything and more, it comes to nothing
If it doesn't come with you

Please, forget me not
I need your simple pleasures to be god
And please, my sweet De Sade
Just eat my heart and twist me into knots

[Bridge]
Something dominating nothing
Nothing animate is something used
Fill me, wait a minute, kill me
Feel me, I am the mood: abuse
Carve, carve, carve
I am starve, starve, starved
For the warmth of your will
And the edge of your purest thrill

Blah, blah, blah, I don't wanna hear shit
Medicals and miracles and all of the obits
We stay all day and leave all night
Tell me like it is because we know it ain't right, they're

[Pre-Chorus]
Paid off
Catch a tiger by the total price of all the penalties
Let's go
And don't you wanna see another model just like you?

Oh, don't adjust your set
Now, careful, there's no feedback guarantees

Title: Butcher’s Hook
Release Date: August 20, 2008, URL: https://genius.com/Slipknot-butchers-hook-lyrics
Song Description: This song is an attack on the pop culture and the general mainstream mentality.

It wouldnt be a Slipknot album if there wasnt an anti-pop song.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
Contrite, commercial
Arrogance, leprosy
Consume the bitch, the fucker
Mindless, like a child
For pity's sake, I've had all that I can take
We try, but in the end, we'll see
There are no more codes
Only who is shit and who's still free
I was gonna change the world with honor and aggression
No one listened, no one cared
All they saw was misdirection

[Chorus: Corey Taylor & Chris Fehn]
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

[Verse 2: Corey Taylor & Chris Fehn]
I don't want you anymore (I don't want you anymore)
I don't need you anymore (I don't need you anymore)
Fingerprint of God
Your new religions covet
This vessel wasn't built to last
But I will live forever
You'll never have to say surrender
Because you're so part of it
My total honesty has no place for tomorrow
Guilty pleasures give me pain
Tell my people I can't follow

[Bridge: Corey Taylor]
You'll never censor me
You better cherish me
My reason has a voice
Freedom's gone but we'll always have a choice
My present future tense
It doesn't make much sense
I'm coming after you
Fuck you all, I'm the only point of view

[Guitar Solo: Jim Root]

[Break: Corey Taylor]
Oh, violence and dollar signs
Another processed piece of shit
You hide your fault in diamonds
And give away the only
Cost, you can't delay the inevitable
Lost, don't understand the incredible path
I'm losing ground, but I won't care when I go down
