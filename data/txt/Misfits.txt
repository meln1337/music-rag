Artist: Misfits
Artist Description: The Misfits are an American punk rock band often recognized as the creators of the horror punk subgenre, blending punk with a melodic 50s rockabilly sound along with horror film themes and imagery.

Founded in 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey, the original lineup consisted of vocalist and keyboardist Glenn Danzig, bassist Jerry Only, and drummer Manny Martínez. Danzig and Only were the only consistent members throughout the next six years, during which they released several EPs and singles, and with Only’s brother Doyle as guitarist, the albums Walk Among Us and Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood, both considered touchstones of the early-1980s hardcore punk movement. The band has had several lineup changes over the years, with bassist Jerry Only being the only constant member in the group.

The Misfits disbanded in 1983, and Glenn Danzig went on to form Samhain and then Danzig. Several albums of reissued and previously unreleased material were issued after the group’s dissolution, and their music later became influential to punk rock, heavy metal, and alternative rock. After a series of legal battles with Danzig, Only and Doyle regained the rights to record and perform as the Misfits. They formed a new version of the band in 1995 with singer Michale Graves and drummer Dr. Chud. This incarnation of Misfits had more of a heavy metal sound and released the albums American Psycho and Famous Monsters before dissolving in 2000. Jerry Only then took over lead vocals and recruited former Black Flag guitarist Dez Cadena and former Ramones drummer Marky Ramone for a Misfits 25th anniversary tour.

This lineup released an album of cover songs titled Project 1950 and toured for several years. In 2005, Marky was replaced by Robo, who had played with Black Flag in the early 1980s and had also previously been Misfits' drummer from 1982 to 1983. This lineup released a single titled Land of the Dead in 2009. The Misfits' lineup of Only, Cadena, and drummer Eric “Chupacabra” Arce released a new album titled The Devil’s Rain in October 2011. In 2015, it was announced that Cadena would be taking a break from music after receiving a cancer diagnosis, and was replaced by Only’s son Jerry Caiafa II, presented as Jerry Other. That same year Soulfly’s Marc Rizzo joined the band, also playing guitar. He filled in for Cadena, before Caiafa would move on to become the sole guitarist for the band.

On September 2016, for the first time in 33 years, Danzig, Only, and Doyle reunited for two headlining shows at the Riot Fest, along with drummer Dave Lombardo and second guitarist Acey Slade. They also reunited for two New Year’s Eve shows in Las Vegas and Los Angeles in December 2017, and later performed again at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey on May 19, 2018.

Songs:

Title: Last Caress
Release Date: January 1980, URL: https://genius.com/Misfits-last-caress-lyrics
Song Description: The first four songs of the Beware sessions were the same mixes used on the Bullet EP, but with the tracks in reverse order. The other side was essentially the Horror Business EP. However, the song Children in Heat was replaced by the only previously unreleased track, Last Caress.

The Beware EP  was recorded at C.I. Recording in New York City, but on two separate occasions, one year apart. Bullet  had been recorded in January 1978. Horror Business was recorded one year later. Last Caress was also recorded at the first session, but was remixed, with reverb added to the vocals and a guitar overdub recorded in September 1979 by Glenn Danzig and Bobby Steele. It was the only track ever to be released from that particular mixing session.

Title: Saturday Night
Release Date: October 5, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Misfits-saturday-night-lyrics
Song Description: The song can easily be taken as the narrators break a girls heart or as the narrator actually committing murder. The 52 ways to murder anyone line, suggests that he breaks a girls heart every Saturday night or the narrator murders a new girl every Saturday night. The narrator then feels guilt because one of his possible victims (Amy) has convinced him to confess and right his wrongs. The line Julie doesnt scream as well suggests that the narrator got bored with Julie and went to Amy, either as murder or heartbreak. The cops can be taken either ways. Either he is confessing how he has broken the hearts of many, or confessing that he had murdered people to the police. But the Police wont listen to him go on and on because there is just so much of him confessing. He then remembers Him and these girls having fun around town but now he misses all of them, because they are either dead or hes dead to them. He then feels mass amounts of sorrows because of this. And as night creeps in he remembers the nights of fun and wishes he still had those.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Woah-ooh-oh-oh
Woah, woah

[Verse]
There's fifty-two ways to murder anyone
One and two are the same and they both work as well
I'm coming clean for Amy, Julie doesn't scream as well
And the cops won't listen all night

[Bridge]
And so maybe I'll be over
Just as soon as I fill them all in

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can remember when I saw her last
We were running all around and having a blast, having a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in is so lonely without you
I know when you're home

[Chorus]
I was thinking about you
There was something I forgot to say
I was crying on a Saturday night
I was out cruising without you

Her mouth of germicide seducing all your glands

Release Date: May 13, 1997, URL: https://genius.com/Misfits-dig-up-her-bones-lyrics
Song Description: Dig Up Her Bones is the seventh track of The Misfits' American Psycho album and the only single of the album. It is the seventh single of the band in overall and the first single released in the post-Danzig era.

It has the first official music video ever released by the Misfits and was composed of live footage of the band, Graves singing in a mock graveyard, and clips from the 1935 horror film Bride of Frankenstein. An image of the Bride was used as the cover image for the single.

Pretorius wishes to work with Henry to create a mate for the Monster, with the proposed venture involving Pretorius growing an artificial brain while Henry gathers parts for the mate. () A storm rages as final preparations are made to bring the Bride to life. Her bandage-wrapped body is raised through the roof, where electricity is harnessed from lightning to animate her. Henry and Pretorius lower her and, after realizing their success in bringing her to life, remove her bandages and help her to stand. () The excited Monster reaches out to her and asks: "Friend? The Bride, screaming, rejects him. The dejected Monster observes: She hate me! Like others.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Anything is what she is
Anywhere is where she's from
Anything is what she'll be
Anything as long as it's mine
And the door it opened a way back in
Or is it way back out?

[Verse 2]
Any place is where she'll be
Any place she'll see you from
Lies and secrets become your world
Anytime, anywhere, she takes me away

[Pre-Chorus]
And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose that's been burned by her son

[Chorus]
Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones

[Verse 3]
I have seen the demon's face
I have heard of her death place
I fall down on my knees
And praised the ground
Horrible things that took her away

Title: Bullet
Release Date: June 1978, URL: https://genius.com/Misfits-bullet-lyrics
Song Description: Bullet is the second single released by the horror punk band The Misfits under the leadership of Glenn Danzig

In 1978 Bullet was released in vinyl 7" format along with additional A-side We Are 138 and B-sides Attitude and Hollywood Babylon. It later appeared on the full album Static Age which was released in 1997

The song is about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the 35th US president during his visit to Texas in 1963. It contains vulgar metaphors for conspiracy theories and political abuse.

The fantasy image of Jackie O fellating the narrator is probably among the most obscene to be expressed in an American song.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
President's bullet-ridden body in the street
Ride, Johnny, ride
Kennedy's shattered head hits concrete
Ride, Johnny, ride
Johnny's wife is floundering, Johnny's wife is scared
Run, Jackie, run

[Chorus]
Texas is an outrage when your husband is dead
Texas is an outrage when they pick up his head
Texas is the reason that the president's dead
You gotta suck, suck, Jackie, suck

[Verse 2]
President's bullet-ridden body in the street
Ride, Johnny, ride
Kennedy's shattered head hits concrete
Ride, Johnny, ride

[Chorus]
Texas is an outrage when your husband is dead
Texas is an outrage when they pick up his head
Texas is the reason that the president's dead
You gotta suck, suck, Jackie, suck

Title: Helena
Release Date: October 5, 1999, URL: https://genius.com/Misfits-helena-lyrics
Song Description: This song is based on the movie Boxing Helena, which tells a story about a surgeon who becomes obsessed with a beautiful woman (Helena) he once was in an affair with. His obsession leads him to amputate her limbs and holds her capitive in his mansion.



This is about a sick desire of being with someone who doesnt care about you, to the point where he doesnt seems to care about the ways to be with her. In his twisted mind, he didnt do anything wrong, and he just cant accept not being loved by her, since he would do anything to be noticed and appreciated by Helena.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
If I cut off your arms and cut off your legs
Would you still love me anyway?
If you're bound and you're gagged, draped and displayed
Would you still love me anyway?

[Chorus]
Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?

[Verse 2]
If I cut off your arms and cut off your legs
Would you still love me anyway?
If you're bound and you're gagged, draped and displayed
Would you still love me, love me anyway?

[Chorus]
Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?

[Bridge]
Go!
Cutting with the knife, blood is spilling everywhere
She will be my wife, secondary spine
Incisions must be accurate, I know just what to do
My hands are trembling, I can't spare to slip up with this knife
Her beauty so illogical, the beast come gliding in
Hideous chameleon stripped down to her skin
Dance to the burning flame, pleasure exhumes the pain
The night bursts into flames
Dance, Helena, dance, oh

Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?

Title: I Turned into a Martian
Release Date: March 1982, URL: https://genius.com/Misfits-i-turned-into-a-martian-lyrics
Song Description: This songs message is very similar to 20 Eyes, the preceding track. Both narrators are so removed from human society that they feel as though they have undergone an actual physical transformation. This transformation, however, did not occur for the better. They describe living in states of isolation, rendered freakish and grotesque. The narrator is now completely lacking the body of a man from Earth.

However, there is one crucial difference between the two songs: one of these men is understandable to us, even in his monstrous pain, and is likely just a confused kid who feels as if he doesnt belong. The other  the one we meet in this song  is unrepentant, possessed by an evil of unknown origin and positively ecstatic as he walks among us, comparing himself to passersby and reveling in the jarring contrast.

 Although Danzig is always more than capable of using allegory or double entendres in order to show us the humanity in the monster, sometimes theres just no humanity to show. There is only the monster.
Lyrics:

[Intro]
One, two!

[Verse 1]
Possession of a mind is a terrible thing
It's a transformation with an urge to kill
Not the body of a man from Earth
Not the face of the one you love, 'cause

[Chorus]
Well, I turned into a Martian (Woah-oh-oh)
I can't even recall my name (Woah-oh-oh)
'Times I never hardly sleep at night (Woah-oh-oh)
Well, I turned into a Martian today

[Verse 2]
I walk down the city streets
On an unsuspectin' human world
Inhuman in your midst
Well, this world is mine to own, 'cause

Born or created in the image of a god
The heavens fall, no savior has been sent
No one to guide us; alone, we face the night
Mortal life is brief for the rebel angels
They make their final stand and soon you'll be alone

Song Description: Night of the Living Dead is a classic 1968 horror film directed by George Romero that essentially codified many of the tropes associated with zombie films ever since.



Romeros work was, of course, a great influence on the whole Misfits horror-punk aesthetics. They would eventually release three other songs inspired by the directors zombie pictures: Day of the Dead, Land of the Dead and Twilight of the Dead.
Lyrics:

Release Date: September 1985, URL: https://genius.com/Misfits-static-age-lyrics
Song Description: The song is a pun on the word Static meaning both stasis in the figurative sense of nothing changing and static in the sense of a disrupted TV reception. The age is static due to both the stasis of spending dead time in front of the TV and distortion in the sense of disrupted signals. Were all blue from projection tubes meaning our color has changed from time in front of the blue screen, powered by the projection tubes, as well as blue as in depressed from this static inaction.
Lyrics:

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Now this is the story
Of a good man named Ed
Left his son for a moment
Returned, found him dead

[Verse 1]
Recalls a tale as a boy he was told
Of an evil witch, so wicked, so old
Seeks a farmer's advice he will not give
His oldest son knows just where the witch lived
He took Ed there but refused to go in
The boy knew what was about to begin
She had the power to avenge the dead
It cost your soul, now come with me Ed

[Chorus]
I'm gonna take you where your body will lie
I'm gonna take you there, my friend
I'm gonna show you where your life will end
I'm gonna bring you here again

[Verse 2]
Dig up this grave, the old lady said
The thing we need lies here dormant, sleeping with the dead
You understand what you ask of me
Not even death can set your soul free
I cast this curse and you will find
An evil darkness deep inside your vengeful mind
God damn you to hell, he could not restrain
He already has son, the witch did explain

Lyrics:

Turn the lights down low
And bar the doors up
Your future is coming
Your future as a chopped up, hacked up, heaving piece of meat

When the door flies open
Hot wind approaches you
Feel the heat, boy
Feel the heat as it burns your balls off

[Chorus]
Death comes ripping
Then you know it, death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
It'll rip your back out, death comes ripping out

Song Description: According to MisfitsCentral.com, the song is based on the 1963 (Remade in 2016) movie of the same name, a horror classic by Herschell Gordon Lewis. It is also influenced by the 1972 Giallo movie The Red Queen Kills Seven Times, sometimes released in VHS and DVD as Blood Feast.





Bloodfeast was on of the originally Samhain songs Glenn Danzig gave to the Misfits to make Earth A.D. a full album.  Bloodfeast is supposed to be a lot slower than it is on that album, according to Glenn.
Lyrics:

Pull off her face, pluck out her eyes
Well, the blood must flow, oh
When it drips from the mouth
Be forewarned, be prepared

Because you just can't fake it
And that blood is just so real
Because you just can't fake it

The master bedroom where the vampires feast
Ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrobes

Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist
And said: "whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?"

Song Description: ?
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Imprisoned in this world
Of darkness few have known
A monster lusting blood and
The hunger grows
Out on the street, danger's real
The killer's still at large
A trail of death through the sewers
To the underground

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel their fleeting life
Draw into my bones
Hear the heart that pounds
The blood that flows
Eternity I damn thee
Let me rot into the ground
As the empty veins collapse
Cast them down

[Chorus]
Living hell, living hell, living hell
I just can't go on
In this living hell

[Verse 2]
This town has worn thin
Everybody knows
Panic in the news
And the terror grows
A tunnel full of filth
Escape into the night
Another hole to dwell
In the underground

Nightmare on elm street
Where I'm trapped inside a dream
Nightmare on elm street
Where no one can hear me scream

A bastard son of 1000 maniacs
Locks us inside his hell
We must send him back
Killed him once
Burning him alive
Kill him twice
Drag him to the other side

Lyrics:

Their eyes for many centuries
Peered in from space
Sincere their hope, their wise belief
That they could teach our race
But yet on Mars, a darker side
Like all things that god made
Their tribe of war, would heed them not
Earth they must invade!

See the fire in the skies
See them devastate the land
Mars attacks!
The warlord chief commands
See the humans fight and die!
See our planet laid to waste
Mars attacks!
Monsters invade the Earth from space

It was then, in our darkest hour
When everything seemed lost
The hearts of man would not concede
No matter what the cost
They forged a sword of sound and steel
Upon the Martian doors
The voice of god would thunder there
Mars would be no more!

Song Description: The song is based on the 1955 American science fiction film of the same name which was adapted from a 1952 novel by Raymond F. Jones.

During the movie, the main characters are captured by beings from another world and are subsequently held in protective tubes, as highlighted in the first half of verse 2. The aliens are in a intergalactic war with another species, however they are about to be defeated. Their plan is to inhabit earth and enslave the humans.
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Furious the exodus walks
Along the maddening march of death
With the furor and the masses
Whose supremacy is the dominion
Alien bodies, stiff and cold
Your inner sane turns numb
You transform into a rage
Too naive to understand

[Chorus]
And they go on as the sacrifice grows
We're living on ground zero fire
This Island Earth
Target locked, systems checked, enter code
We're living on ground zero fire

[Verse 2]
Locked up in a room
Human belongs in a cage
The sentence is a science death
As they pulls the triggers of ray guns
Evil blackened eyes of youth
Absorbing lives, hidden anguish
Death thrown about the ground
Of those who wouldn't fight
